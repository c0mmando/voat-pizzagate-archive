            Due to the fact no children have been involved so far, Weinstein stuff needs to go in

             Wow, I find it pretty offensive you think PG is only about kids.  Personally, I think it's about all victims, including adult survivors.  And it's about the programming, the codes they use that have infiltrated Hollywood.

              I'm not sure how you thought it was otherwise, but it is explicitly about children.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm sure there are adults today who were victims when they were children, but the key there is "while they were children".
              <br/>
              Many of the methods and techniques used by people like Weinstein are also used by people who focus on children, and I'm also sure that people that do this to adults are also facilitators for people that seek out children.
             </p>
             <p>
              If there were some link and supporting evidence to show how Weinstein helped others access child actors it would fit here otherwise it doesn't.

               It's divide and conquer.  We are never gonna win if we don't come together.  You guys want to pidgeonhole yourselves?  Go right ahead.

              <p>
               This is an entire network that needs to be taken down, and I don't think much progress can be made until we get free press back, which means going after
               <em>
                media moguls

              <p>
               You guys can insult me all you want.  It's pretty sick how you seem to enjoy it.  But I still fundamentally disagree with your tactics of deleting submissions.
              </p>
              <p>
               You guys want attention brought to the PizzaGate problem?  Then stop silencing people.  Seems to me the more voices the better.  But you guys are shitting all over people on your own team.

                More forced narrative spin, the illusion of group cohesion.

                I am my own team, I speak for myself and allow others to speak for themselves.
                <br/>
                This is a very large community filled with people who have often conflicting views on things, attempts to build falsehood of group homogeneity is a way of

                 actually
                </strong>
                silencing all the people who feel they don't conform to the perceived desired group traits.

                It's step one in creating false in group / out group dynamics, which in turn is the foundational element of divide and conquer.

               <p>
                And lastly, the amount of effort you've applied to arguing

                  I'm good, really.  After what my ex husband put me through, you really can't do much damage to this "shitposter."   I am, however, worried about how your abusive behavior will be perceived by the
                  <em>
                   adult survivors
                  </em>
                  in this forum.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Never would I make light of the rape and trafficking of children.  No one here needs to read those abusive comments.  That's pretty fucked up what you said.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But as I've suspected, this forum is all about divide and conquer and controlling the narrative and keeping a lid on the truth so too much doesn't spill out.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You're a troll, even if you don't realize it.  But since your last comment was threatening, I really am done communicating with you.  The right answer to my abusive ex husband was always to walk away.

                   Oh, I also don't believe the "adult survivors" in this forum.  Most of them aren't even PG-related, they just "survived" something unrelated, but the ones that CLAIM to be PG-related are most likely lying or shills.

                    So you're not a victim of sexual abuse as a child?  Because a survivor would know that unhealthy relationships are par for the course being a survivor.

                   <p>
                    Or maybe you are a victim, and you haven't worked on your anger issues.

                   <p>
                    I just don't get the ridiculous policing around here.  If a topic isn't helpful or relevant, it will die on its own.  But here comes the thought police, you know those people with control issues, and they get to decide what's relevant.

                    I didn't even make the submission that was deleted, FYI.  She was very polite about it actually.  I just happened to disagree with your decision.

                    Had she posted about auto repair, then obviously I would have understood.  But I don't see how this age restriction is helping anyone.  Especially not when

                   <p>
                    And in case you didn't notice, there already is enough evidence to convict some pedophiles.  And your problem lies with the Justice System in the country.

I certainly wouldn't be bringing it up to strangers on the internet after being called out for not following the fucking rules.  I like how your excuse for not following the rules is "I was raped"; typical woman, can't be bothered with accountability for your own actions - no, it's someone else's fault!

            Heard about it on the radio.  I find it pretty sick how "sex abuse allegations" are always followed by "but she could be lying, and here's 10 reasons why she's probably lying."  It's just automatic out of their mouths to start defending the rapist before considering any evidence.

            Same article I was just reading --
Any males here want to try to explain this insanity?
Is it about a "power trip"?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             She says the experience left her shocked, and that while she told friends privately what happened, she remained quiet because she was in a long-term relationship and fearful of the power that Weinstein wielded in the media.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Seems at the least a valid explanation -- her career -- her personal romantic relationship.
But, I'd also add that when a guy corners you in an area that way and is blocking you from
exiting, females understand that anything can happen.  He can ejaculate and choke you to death.
He can decide to rape you or force any other sexual act on you.
A female has to consider the worst that might happen.
            <br/>
            And certainly he would have influence over her media employment.

              And I imagine the "ritual" abuse is for an organized matriarchal religion worth trillions?
And which operates worldwide and which is recognized by the UN as a "sovereign state"?
You know, the one with all of its priests pedophiles having almost brought down the church?
The one referred to by John Stockwell (former CIA) as "Catholics in Action" also known as CIA?
The one which issued the Papal Edicts to "enslave or murder" Africans here and Native Peoples?

              Evidently you don't want to give any real though as to male involvement in sexual assault of women,
harassment of women, the oppression of women, or sexual abuse of children.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is why oppression of women was so necessary to the Vatican and why the rise of feminism 
so frightens them.

                If anyone looks at your posts Eso they will see you obsessions and fanaticism
having to do with trying to convince everyone here that it is homosexuals and 
transgenders who are sexually abusing children.
That's pure disinformation which you are peddling.
               </p>
               <p>
                And studies make that clear -- MALES are our sexual abusers of children and they are
heterosexual males.
               </p>
               <p>
                Catholic Church's priests have been sexually abusing children since day #1 of the Church.

                 Attempting to blame "christianity" for the invasion of the Jesuits into the Catholic Church. Nice try. Tell all those satanic ritual abuse survivors how all those women that abused them were really men, that won't fly.

                <p>
                 People can read your own opinions here and make up their own minds. You explain your philosophy very well, about how MEN are just making up a satan as a cover for child abuse, blah blah blah as you push your transgender pedo agenda.

                  If you read my comment, you didn't come close to understanding it.
WHAT CHURCH were the women performing the rituals for other than Christian churches?
And likely RCC... That's where these rituals and organized pedophilia by priests begins.
Ask the Italians.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  No ... male-dominated religion ... male-supremacist religion -- didn't invent Satan/Devil
"as a cover for child abuse" but of course it serves multiple purposes.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  They invented Satan/Devil in order to Frighten/paralyze their members in 
order to control them.  Keep them from asking too many questions - challenging 
male-supremacist religion.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You do realize that suggesting that someone is "pushing a transgender pedo agenda" is
like suggesting that someone is pushing homosexuality.  Evidently you truly believe that
those conditions are "catching."  :)  Actually -- and I don't really know -- but I imagine that
transgender is RARE.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  On the other hand, evidently every couple has a 30% chance of having a homosexual child.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             It’s Cain and Abel — Hollywood style.
            </p>
            <p>
             Disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein may have been stabbed in the back by his own brother, who, sources told The Post, has been trying for years to replace his sibling as the sole head of their marquee film studio.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bob Weinstein, the disgruntled co-founder of The Weinstein Company, may have been the mastermind behind an exposé of lurid sex allegations that led to his brother’s humiliating downfall, the sources said.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Bob’s wanted Harvey out for years,” said a former staffer, who added that the two brothers are becoming increasingly suspicious of each other.
            </p>
            <p>
             Insiders believe that Bob may have helped concoct the explosive New York Times story that exposed the harassment allegations from Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan and other former employees.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Bob may have even fed this story” to the Times, the insider said.
            </p>
            <p>
             There may have been a taste for vengeance in the brother’s fateful move, as another insider said, “Bob wanted Harvey to get what’s coming to him.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The backlash from the scandal is expected to oust Harvey from the storied franchise — for now — settling a long-simmering feud between the two.
            </p>
            <p>
             “There has always been a love-hate relationship between the brothers,” says a former Weinstein employee.
            </p>
            <p>
             “There have been times they wouldn’t speak for months. Let’s just say they have an ‘inconsistent’ relationship.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Another source added, “Bob’s trying to take over and push Harvey out” and also said that some staffers at The Weinstein Company believe Bob was a source of the damning Times story.

            The worst part is how his lawyer is defending his behavior, that he is "deeply sorry for his actions." The MSM and the liberals are giving him a pass because he's a huge donor. Had this been a Republican, they would have torn him apart. Hypocrites. I don't care how deeply sorry he is, he used his position and power to take advantage of women and should be excoriated if not prosecuted.

            This is beyond bad. This isn't an "old dinosaur" as he was portrayed, this is a monster with no regard for women and into a power trip.
           </p>
           <p>
            And really, look at how grown women are intimidated. Can you imagine a child being in this type of situation? You can get some idea of how thee children are destroyed by reading these types of accounts.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm very happy this reporter finally got to speak about what happened, and I hope more women will do the same. I know there are tons more women out there that have been subjected to this obscene behavior.

              I love them.  I hate how fat they make them get.  It is disgusting. I have pig notepads, and other things and head out to a certain farm to pet and feed pigs just for fun.  We do it once every summer.  They are adorable.  Needless to say, I do not eat pork.

                EEK, when I think of meat and JP I think of what might be put in OUR meat.  Ground meat of some type on pizzas, in sausages, etc.  Mixed in with?    The pig ranch.  Butcher.  Scary.  I don't want to buy any type of ground meat or sausage now.
