            You'd think somebody who works hard at making this website would know or at least make reference to it's suspension. He either doesn't know yet, is trying to reupload everything, or something much worse.

             It's strange indeed. I hope one of the former. Were all the domains registered through GoDaddy? GoDaddy last month suspended stormfront, could it be they've suspended Rebel's domains on PG?
            </p>
            <p>
             If so, surely he would know.  GoDaddy gave Stormfront a chance to relocate the domain -
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              We informed The Daily Stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider, as they have violated our terms of service.
— GoDaddy (
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/GoDaddy">
               @GoDaddy
              </a>
              ) August 14, 2017
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Or, could it be they let them expire without sending a renewal notice to Rebel?
            </p>
            <p>
             Is R so busy that he hasn't checked his PG emails and missed the domain renewals?

            I'll email him but resteeming something is not evidence that it is him. The amount of time he put into all three of his websites, all of which are now suspended seems odd.

            He resteemed something but since his doxxing and how frequently he posted about pedogate, I still don't beleive it's him and if it is, why has he kept quite after being an avid researcher who would answer everyone's questions in a matter of minutes. He has yet to provide an answer to the Steemit question on pizzagate, despite resteeming a post, which is odd.

            Anyone have full archives locally of the pizzagate.wiki site? The site was insnane in the amount of data and how it was organized. It was the perfect place to add our findings, which rebelscum always accepted if everything was sourced. His absence is just off.

             By the looks of his Steemit page he's involved in other things just now, such as writing about alchemy and developing huge new features for the Steemit platform. Could be that he hasn't visited Voat in a while (lots havent I guess), and hasn't heard that there's an outcry over the PG Wiki going down?
            </p>
            <p>
             Still think it would be honourable of you to update the OP that he's posting on Steemit. I searched around for him for a couple of hours before seeing GothamGirl's post. As I could've spent that time elsewhere, I'm thinking of others who may do the same.

            Finding this old Voat thread of his confirms his Voat alt is spelt with a K ---

            It's a concern. RebelSkum was totally driven and did awesome work for the cause.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just had a look around and here's what I found. Last post online, apart from the Steemit resteam 8 days ago, seems to be on Voat 3 months ago, so start of June. The accounts below seem to go quiet from March &amp; April.

            It appears Rebel's been posting over the past few months on Steemit, and resteemed an article 8 days ago.

            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The PG Wiki was heavily DDOS'd a couple of times, both time we're when he released his Dyncorp research. He was convinced it was being targeted by Dyncorp and had proof of the attacks coming from their domains.

            </a>
            , could this be one of his alt twitter accounts? See the retweet from Feb 18 mentioning Dyncorp, Pedogate &amp; Pizzagate. Last tweet was March and he said 'I am taking this account inactive to leave it for references'.

            His YT channel was last updated on March 7. One of the 3 podcasts there is on Dyncorp, and is 'not available'. Hmmm. Only 1 of the 3 uploads is now 'available'.

            Someone wrote an article about him, the pgwiki and all he was doing. I think back around March. He doxxed himself in it. Im taking a look for it. Edit - can't find this article at ALL.

            Unless he was using a fake name he posted it pretty openly and claimed he was from or living in Idaho. His twitter handle at

            had a full name. Maybe someone could try to contact one of his friends or family?

           <p>
            I'm guessing the name could have been fake though if he was smart. IDK man this shit is really sad.

            I think his real name is R. Zimmerman. He was doing radio/youtube shows at one point to spread the message. and he was particular about getting the facts sorted from the wild speculation for the wiki.  He used to post and comment all the time.  It is weird that he is suddenly quiet. If you pinged him, he was usually right on it.

            I am not very tech savvy as many know but even I get what you mean and I agree. Something is very fishy. Oops forgot. Tons of Upvoats are in order.
