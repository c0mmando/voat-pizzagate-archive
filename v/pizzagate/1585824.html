<p>Henry Kissinger said &quot;Chinatown&quot; really IS the best movie ever made!&quot;, laughing to and with a man I know who is a political and artworks insider. I asked him why they were laughing. What\'s so funny. I\'ve seen the .I\'ve many times. The rich man\'s daughter and her young daughter both have coloboma. A huge deal is made over it. The rich man raped his daughter and got her pregnant, a few years before. The girl is Faye Dunaway\'s daughter AND sister. Faye Dunaway\'s dies and the rich man gets access to the young granddaughter, then, as she had kept her away. Jack Nicholson wants to kill him, and a fellow cop says &quot;Let it go, it\'s Chinatown&quot;, referring to the past when Jake tried to help a girl in Chinatown, but got her killed because he did.</p>
<p>This is my third time on here pointing it out. The flawed iris means something and has for a long time. Movie set in 30\'s or 40\'s. Why did Kissinger say that. He doesn\'t give a flying fuck about films. My friend wouldn\'t tell me. It\'s to do with incest. With the rich always winning, and us being humiliated and stomped in the ground.</p>
<p>This movie and screenplay is taught in film schools and made a huge deal over. It\'s good, but not that good. Script by Robert Townsend, directed by pervert Roman Polanski.</p>',

            Cloning and Mk Ultra have the same effect on the eyes. Amanda K is a clone, Madeline's name comes up in the mk ultra files. Maybe there is connection of it all...

             Pizzagate will expose the great
greatest evil ever...
There is multiple sites that tie in together to expose the bigger picture of this evil. I verified every single word, except the coded ones. I know the docs are mk ultra related. There is pics of the damage it creates to an eye, on that site to.

             FBI anons "cards" are sim cards which are helping create pedo's, and choas believe it or not. They're using frequecies. I have even named the programmers in another post recently. Lets just say that troll left me alone pretty quick..

            <p>
             There is multiple sites exposing what &amp; who these demons are. The World Corpo Site is linked to them as well. Once your eyes are tuned in you can easily visually spot the markers.

            Another connection to "Rosemary's Baby" :
           </p>
           <p>
            The neighbors were a Satan ring; who bribed the husband by blinding his rival for an acting job
[so we've got the Satanists who mean business here - get the connection?]
           </p>
           <p>
            They gas-lighted her ["mind control technique"] , then told her the baby died, but they stole it
           </p>
           <p>
            The actress Mia Farrow herself was involved with a pedo later in her life ["Woody"] and all this was denied by the mainstream ["gaslighted"]
           </p>
           <p>
            She lost her virginity to a 50 some odd year old man when she was 17 [Frank Sinatra]

             The funny thing about the actor being blinded (and it was overkill, not "break a leg!") is that the part Guy then got to play was a character on crutches. It was probably in the book because Polanski lifted all the dialogue verbatim, so they say.

             They are literal (blinding)when they want to be-like Polanski cutting Jake's nose in Chinatown because he was nosey. Everything is a sign, symbol, inside joke, reference to ancients. I hate eating dinner with such people. Talking in front of you in inside jokes they know you don't get.

             I think Mia was MK. She only woke up when Woody started abusing her kids. And her son is Sinatra's-looks just like him only blonde. So few people are blonde!

             This is a long article with a lot of evidence, almost 80 pages, so take some time and don't dismiss it, until you had time to review it seriously. It's very important. ^^^^

             Here is a long series on the connections between the Military, Culture management, Satanism. which can go a long way to fill in exactly how it is that government is involved in these areas via "Pizzagate" . Control of children and young people is essential for long - term molding/modeling and control of the society  - for these culture engineers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here is 10 hours here of material on this, which goes into Satanism as a philosophy and how people are brought into it and adapted to the mores of it:

            I really need to know why my posts agains are not showing up. 
I posted , edit and refreshed; and the post was gone.. After a lot of work. 
I have to think about what the post entailed to understand exactly why .. 
I 'm going to do it in short comments now to avoid one long post that gets erased.

            At the age of 12 years old, according to rational wiki, half of the populations pineal glands will have calcified. source:

            It would be presumable, the calcified pineal glands are the result of a lack of amino-acid within the diet, or speculatively genetics.

            Perdiccas appointed Ptolemy, one of Alexander's closest companions, to be satrap of Egypt. Ptolemy ruled Egypt from 323 BC, nominally in the name of the joint kings Philip III and Alexander IV. ... As Ptolemy I Soter ("Saviour"), he founded the Ptolemaic dynasty that was to rule Egypt for nearly 300 years. source:

            The Ptolemaic Kingdom (/ˌtɒləˈmeɪ.ɪk/; Ancient Greek: Πτολεμαϊκὴ βασιλεία, Ptolemaïkḕ Basileía)[3] was a Hellenistic kingdom based in Egypt. It was ruled by the Ptolemaic dynasty which started with Ptolemy I Soter's accession after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and which ended with the death of Cleopatra VII and the Roman conquest in 30 BC. source:

             To generalise, Jewish people have a lot of problems from inbreeding, because they want to marry within. My great-great grandparents were first cousins on my dad's side.

               I don't know; I haven't looked into her yet. TPTB do a lot of what I call catbirding. They give their children to be raised in another family. People wonder about Tom Cruise and who he really is, and say the son he adopted might actually be Will Smith's.

            There is a thread on this from Jan. 17 it must have been deleted.Check into the cause of coloboma. It is related to the Pax gene and RH negative blood type. This gene has influence on pineal gland and cellular aging/death! 
Research history of RH negative bloodtype. What it means during pregnancy? Why those with RH negative blood types are on an international registry.  The name of this registry is C A R I S.

             It would be presumable, the calcified pineal glands are the result of a lack of amino-acid within the diet, or speculatively genetics.

             Perdiccas appointed Ptolemy, one of Alexander's closest companions, to be satrap of Egypt. Ptolemy ruled Egypt from 323 BC, nominally in the name of the joint kings Philip III and Alexander IV. ... As Ptolemy I Soter ("Saviour"), he founded the Ptolemaic dynasty that was to rule Egypt for nearly 300 years. source:

It was ruled by the Ptolemaic dynasty which started with Ptolemy I Soter's accession after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and which ended with the death of Cleopatra VII and the Roman conquest in 30 BC. source:

              Some say Roman and Sharon were making child porn there, and she wanted out. And John Lennon was supposed to be there that night. Steve McQueen was DEFINITELY invited, but his girlfriend wanted a quiet night in.

                Steve McQueen told people, later. It was in biographical material. He was married, but with a girlfriend. It was an invite. McQueen was very combative with directors, producers, very difficult. Probably he was a target. 
Lennon, that I can't remember and maybe it was a different night. Of course, Manson worshipped the White Album. I've read that Jay Sebring, famous hairdresser, was part of the plan, but he accidentally got murdered.

                 That's crazy. I believe it though. Lennon had his phone tapped a lot around then, and then Nixon had it in for him. They say his assassin was probably cia because of his extensive travels that happened to be cia nests and yet he had no money to afford the trips. And they say he really didn't know any beatles or lennon songs

            'Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown' is the line and it  means that it's pointless to pursue because Chinatown runs by it's own rules, controlled by Associations/Triad gangs and with it's own customs and justice system. This is true in real Chinatowns, they're like a separate country within a city. I have met people that lived in Chinatown their entire life and can barely speak english or speak in broken english. They are a separate society withing ours.

             I am very curious as to why Chinatown is held up as the best film ever, taught in film school, chuckled over by Kissinger... it's clearly a really misogynist film. Its ending, by Polanski, not Towne, is to give no hope to women survivors and child survivors.To make them feel despair. Roman is the devil. Since the coloboma is made so much of (incest survivors have plenty of little or big birth defects to choose from) I want to know why the big deal? In the 1930's, who would have known about PAX? No one. This goes way back. A lot of Illuminati children must have had it-maybe the ones who were products of incest, mostly. And the movie came out in 1974. Still most people wouldn't know of PAX. 
I love movies, I think about them. I don't understand why I had to finally explain all this to folks as smart as you lot. Love you, though. Thanks for bearing with me. I was a victim. You can't imagine how important all of this is to me. It's my whole life.&lt;3

              So you are saying that the Coloboma and thus the movie has some kind of cult significance? I really don't have the knowledge off the occult to try to stumble backwards into their teachings to find an order that ties coloboma and the other occult stuf we have seen.
