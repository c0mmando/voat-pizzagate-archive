            This is still the funniest reply I've read on here. "Only  Chris Martin can save us now"
            <br/>
            Ok, I was pushed to a breaking point, but I have my sanity back. LOL. I think Chris needs to save himself

            I really thought he was Mossad BC that is what he admitted to - "Good Mossad" he said.
He is a disinfo agent! Those with eyes will see.

            Yeah well I was sitting in my running car in a police station fighting off my harassers/informants. I'm not a great multitasker. Plus so much I had to skip over BC it would have been a great embarrassment to Webb and his cheap sex talk

            You could only imagine the disinfo I had to sort through. When you have like 15 "sources" feeding you information - truth mixed w lies- I never knew what hit me.  One day I'll get my whole story out there and prevent this from happening to other vulnerable women.

            This is going to sound weird but back in the early days Webb talked about meeting some Hollywood execs about the "story". At the time I wondered what exactly the story was and I even commented that it should be documentary because Hollywood would spin the narrative.
           </p>
           <p>
            His constant references to Hollywood films and their plots has always bugged me. In fact what finally made me connect some dots was his reference to "Coyote Ugly." What's his connection to the film industry? Did the two Studio execs "option" the narrative?

             Two Oliver Stone producers met with Webb in Oregon Wendy said. He never heard from them again. It was a cruel hoax that would never come to fruition.

            I followed the instructions, and I researched every thing Ben Ben claimed.  Wendy Doster MD is thr dame person as this Wendy Doster. The MD, Wendy Doster from NC IS ilegit.  I traced her back before Pre med.  I checked her physicians license and it is current and in good standing. I checked every convo Ben Ben had with Wendy  was immediately suspicious and she  blocked him. He had no intimate phone relationship.  Bem Ben lives in UK. HE has a middle Eastern accent. I'll explain that later. I called him out last evening and he threatened me a couple of times. This person was able to disrupt the forum and have 95% of the group ready to lynch Wendy due to her varied career.  I searched every job she had and found nothing inappropriate.
            <br/>
            I an fed up with Wendy. I want to be fair especially if she's ill. She has managed to have me investigated and who she used gained access to my computer because he gave her a report. Of the sensitive files I have  it's all in her tweets today. Two nights ago my computer was devastated by a  Trojan virus. My computer has no files I can access.
My feeling Ben Ben is a Middle Eastern national living in UK and a troll. If you have found anything that supports his claim that's provable, please let me know. He's continuing his disruption and threats to me as of today. She has been successful in her vengeance.

              I didn't say you were am MD. That asshole who you communicate with known as Ben Ben on Webb's channel,  said one of your aliases was that of a woman with the same name. SHE is legit. This guy attempted to draw suspicion you were involved on some Florida murders. He's a dangerous guy.

             No. You are trying to set Gwen up. There's no resemblance to each other. You are wrong. I also checked her medical license.  Gwen/Wendy just happen to have the same name only. Gwen s dad is Wolfgang. Different father.

              Set her up how? By questioning her internet identity?
She lied about quite a lot untill now.
Did you see a picture of Dr Wendy Doster,the pediatrician from Virginia anywhere,or you just found some written data on the internet "proving"she exists?
And how strange there's a younger  person ,that looks very much like wendy,who moves from Virginia to NY,where everything is happening.
And no,wendy's alleged children don't look like her ,or their father.
Maybe just all coincidences,
But one has to stay sharp,this is ,after all ,the Matrix.

               You never questioned her about her identity. You were manipulating her to divulge things to satisfy your creepy mind.  They are coincidences. People have the same name. There's nothing in your gossip that can be proven true. Stop your craziness.  I know there are people like you who get attached to a person and stalk them. You need to stop stalking her. It's against the law in the US.

            At this point dcdale, I'm assuming nothing. Both Gwen or Wendy, you, and Love Good have said things I was not aware of. The HRC benet stuff is completely new to me. With Webb, sure seems like it but I'm not seeing the negative effect of Webb's reporting yet . Would love to hear why Wendy thinks Sanders was the only candidate to receive an electoral vote too.

             Webb has nothing to do with the Jon Benet Ramsey murder. That is Clinton and a lot of elite.  The elite org. is a gambling in real time on the time of death someone dies. They watch someone being tortured and bet on the time of death. JABS. Joint Automatic Betting System. I found the links at
abeldanger.net
A world wide investigative group that is headed by Field McConnell.  This betting system shocked me so much I felt sick. He has been investigating Hillary for decades.
It's either Automated or Automatic.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have no solid proof Webb is involved with anyone's death. Just speculation.

              Oh, sorry dale, I meant there was talk of the tape and apparently he wasn't interested in covering it. Also, I shouldn't have been talking second had w/o at least quoting. My apologies.

             Don't threaten me. I saw your convo with Gwen telling her you fathered your sister's two children.  Whether you did or not is not the point. You used every possible means to manipulate her.  Then spread false information trying to turn everyone against her.  What sick game are you playing?  You a serious investigator.  I don't think so.

              I fathered my sisters two children,and you saw the convo?
Looks like you're about as twisted as she is.
Where do I threaten you?
Turning everyone against her?
Like she needs any help with that.
I don't know what you got yourself into,and I hope you get out without too much damage.
Wendy has been stating certain personal facts that are at least doubtfull.
But she seems to be very involved in all kinds of stuff that didn't happen in Minneapolis.
So I looked further and found some things that might be too much of a coincidence.
I find wendy a very interesting source of info,and I have nothing against her.
So please,don't discharge your frustrations on me,I'm no part of whatever you thought you were doing.

               Nah. Troll. Not good. You should have deleted the incest story with your sister. You lie big time. I see how you try to manipulate people on here with your BS. Geez. Did you feel better after telling Gwen you were sexually abused and that's normal where you come from. A Jew who reads the bible All your words. .

            Pizzagate....I've been posting this name for a while. JOSEPH BRANTLEY
I was in a pizzagate forum for a while and this guy responds to my comment. It seemed off somehow.  I looked up his FB page. 
HIGH PRIEST at Comet Ping Pong. 
Paid protester for George Soros.  I searched everywhere for a current address. Old addresses are in and around the DC Metro area.

            I feel sorry for Wendy, she is obviously a sick women. Her psychotic episode perhaps spurred by a fleeting romance via text messages. I think she is censoring the release of the text since the conversation isn't flowing naturally. She also seems to be baiting him along the way. What guy wouldn't fall for that. Stop and realize the GW has been making these videos for 172 days. I've been following attentively since Day 84. He never takes a day off. He has thousands of comments to read and respond to, research and plan each day for new content, Follow the news and various alt-channels... He doesn't have the time or an opportunity to have fun. Poor guy gets distracted by a bored housewife with a few screws loose and his messages are smeared across twitter. Move on people.  Let the man do his work.

             Agree. It's people like shachalnur who won't let it go. The guy us a stalker and posting lies. I checked every one of his claims all false.  Let's hope this stops.

              What's the benefit of any of it? 
Sadly, she's only making herself look bad. 
G.W. has handled it beautifully by not giving it any attention. 
Again showing his honorable qualities.

              My pizzagate submissions.  They were up for 2 months. I'm new to this. Not sure what I violated. 
Gwen is right on. Believe her. She's mad at me? But I want to support her.

            I know. I read it too. The problem is Hillary sodomizing a grown man with a dildo to humiliate him is pretty hard to believe. Let's just call a spade a spade that whole conversation was a hoax.

            After reading the messages I think that George let his guard down because a pretty lady made him horny. It happens all too often. I thought it very interesting and had tons of great info! One thing makes me so pissed off though; Here we are drudging around in all the shit of disinfo day after day trying to shed some light on the truth and their are people out their, like George, that know so freakin much about the elite pedos. It just sucks, they have all the intel, and we have to fight to stay awake so we can uncover the needle of truth in this elitist propaganda haystack. Arg, Not fair!

            I couldnt find it. She posted an hour ago that she deleted alot of them for personal reasons, but she had more to post later. Since she deleted them, I dont know that I could legally post the screenshots I have. Just gonna delete them. Frankly, I'm sick of the whole thing, and wont be reading any of her further posts. I guess you could DM her and ask her.

            George posted some new info on the Seth Rich murder today. If he has that kinda inside info, dont you think he knows the inside stuff on pizzagate? I made a plea to him tonight on his youtube channel to please release what he knew so pizzagate could be exposed and no more children will be hurt and was told I was a disrupter. Caring about children is now disruptive. Sick world in which we live, full of sick people. Best wishes.

             Lotsa disinfo. I broke through and found the truth in this snakes den. Assange was captured and compromised. Lost control of Wiki. JA is one of the good ones, and there are few. With so many MEN feeding me DISINFO, yes for a while I did think they were all Mossad. In the end I learned TRUST WHAT NO ONE SAYS. I connected the dots on my own and my sanity was restored

               Do you know if JA is dead or alive? There is no question he is not in control of Wiki. He would not have removed the Myra Breckenridge emails and such. I wonderif  I had the dead mans hash in my files, but my computer was stolen

                i dont know anything for sure.... they took the real original julian out of the embassy way back in october and dropped him at a cia black site. but the thing is he was an asset or agent so idont think theyd kill him, well i dont know their policy but they could probably just stick him in a DUMB where he will live in luxury till he dies, and CIA or MOSSAD or whoever gets to rape people with his wikileaks that honestly never accomplished anythign anyway just now is probably imho way more dangerous for well meaning people/whistleblowers or wtvr

               Julian is not in charge of Wikileaks, imo
I hope he is not dead. I have a feeling he is not.
Julian, I know now is a hero
Wikileaks got taken by the CIA
I would love to print out myvwhole thread of conversations w Webb and print it out for everyone to read. It would clarify a lot

            Guys, calm down.

           <p>
            Did you actually have READ the whole thing ?

           <p>
            He unravel the whole story. Their conversation is mind blowing and she looks pretty dumb regarding the amount of info he gave to her. He explained everything : CIA, Mossad, Pakistani IC, Ukraine IC, replacing the whole story in the WW2/Cold war context, HRC &amp; ratlines, the threats he received (dead fish outside of his door), CIA kids being "tested" at 7 years old, the fact Obama IS a CIA kid like many other "personal assistants", Kissinger involvement in all that shit, the fact Trump was not expected to be POTUS at all.
           </p>
           <p>
            He explained EVERY ASPECT of "pizzagate/pedogate". Like... Where did the kids came from, what are they used for, who is pulling strings...

            When did he tried to "MK'd" her ? He even gave information about his motives and about himself and it sounds pretty credible. He is

            Also, this conversation is from early March (7-8).
           </p>
           <p>
            Her tweets are NUTS, what is she trying to accuse him of ? Unraveling the biggest scandal in human history ?

            Connect the dots, he is legit.

             His info seems legit.
            </p>
            <p>
             His/her relationship is meaningless to pizzagate and I wished she had not put that out there.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, his stating to her that he is working as a journalist for Russia is a prob...it goes to credibility....and it must have struck a nerve because he seems rattled in the last few vids. Maybe he thought she would not post their convo after he challenged her to do so this morning.
            </p>
            <p>
             For whom he is working is important because it slants the narrative.
            </p>
            <p>
             That said, if he already has this info about these children being used by the elites, why doesnt he put it out there NOW and stop it so no other children suffer at their hands?
            </p>
            <p>
             George, if ya readin this, and you have the info that can bring this abuse of children down, then put it out there and stop stringing it along. There are children being harmed.

              He is trying to get proofs for the public. You know, the people. And he is right : evidences have been buried, the "elite" and the people involved perfectly know this is true. But at that point telling the population that X or Y is a kiddie fucker and that he engaged victims as assistants, without strong evidence, will lead to nothing more than losing credibility and feeding the "fake news" narrative.

            wow. I just read her screenshots. 
Im sorry to say I think this lady just snapped. I think you can see how her texts to him get more frenzied over time. Ive been watching his series for quite a while now, and I know she was a frequent commenter, and was kind of a drama queen with another participant who was eventually blocked.  I think the poor lady just had a break with reality. Sorry. I don't even understand what her claims are against him, other than the internet flirting. Nothing she says in her tweets seem to match up with her screenshots of their convos.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, I don't know where GW gets his info, he's obviously really good at research and perhaps seeing patterns others wouldn't normally see. Its cool to see other people participating in this research. But I still like to look for research coming out from other people to corroborate his claims/theories.
           </p>
           <p>
            edit: Its pizzagate related because of his research (and their convos) talk about abduction of children for certain elites, training them for future positions of power, and other stuff. Its gross but not entirely unbelievable at this point, after everything we've been seeing.

             Nope, no break w reality. Just was tweeting while stuck at police station trying to save my life. Only posted a FRACTION of our conversations and had to leave most out BC of all the times he said he loved me in between. Didn't want to embarrass Webb too much. Oh, Ladonna attacked me. I never provoked a SINGLE person, not my style. Done shilling now?

             You got it : absolutely nothing in her tweets is matching the content of her screenshots.
            </p>
            <p>
             At best, she is promoting him. At worst, she is backstabbing him hoping users will not read/understand the content of her screenshots (?) There is a high probability she was set for entrapping him.

I didn't see any of them. Recently on twitter. 
Anyway,  she'll be more credible once she all back.

              She's off her rocker living in some kind of alternate reality. I don't see anything in those tweets other than him trying to explain things to her and her taking a lot of things out of context or not understanding them.

                   I don't know but she still posts on his videos and appears still under his "spell".  It's important that people are aware of the three major "hooks" for recruiting people - money, emotion - be it revenge or ideology and sex.

             My issue is that he told her he works for Russia thru some Czech. Which totally matches him always asking for his vids to be tweeted to RT. Yes, his info is good. I know I've been critical of him in the past cuz something just didnt smell right about him. I'm not trying to get anyone to stop listening to him, but I, for one, am done. He is either working for Russia as he told her, or he lied to an obviously mentally disturbed woman. That just makes him questionable to me but each to his own.

             He has connections somewhere because he stated emphatically to her a few times that Braverman is def in Israel. How does he know that?
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway, it's good to glean the pizzagate info out and hopefully it can be useful.

               You may very well be right. I watched his yesterdays vids and todays. He's been on Pakistani intelligence as the major culprit for weeks now. Today, without explanation, he did an about-face and now says its Dubai ISI and spoiled Dubaian rich kids. Not Pakastani, at all.

               What astounded me was in the comments section. Not a single person questioned him on this shift. They just all accepted it without question. Talk about sheeple. I'm still stunned by the "yes, Master" demeanor. Crazy.

              Don't be so quick to dismiss her. I've worked closely with her for many months. Her fear of death happened a couple of months ago. I came across either leaked or hacked documents related to pizzagate last year. I kept it quiet while I looked for someone with better Computer skills than me to cross reference my files with known suspects identified by other citizen journalists, Webb's channel etc. I felt I could trust her and shared it. She passed the file indiscriminately thinking she was helping me. She went to Webb with it. He declined. He was adamant from day one he was not getting into pizzagate.  He gave somewhat vague reasons.
              <br/>
              Anyway, I was a bit freaked because of all the deaths surrounding the Clintons and other reasons. When I discussed this with her, she panicked. She's been that way ever since. I knew about her infatuation with Webb. I cautioned her. She became extremely possessive of his time. She always wanted to give the documents I had. She also shared intimate details of her life. She suffered childhood trauma and exhibits the lasting effects. Her love for a man she never met and frightened she would be killed because of my files. Add everything Webb gave her.She has a need to be accepted, make up for bad times, etc. 
Right now she's angry at me. I was unavailable to her for several days and she thought I aligned myself with Webb. She accused me of being deceptive. She said Webb used me to brownstone Epstein. It looks like that may have been erased. 
I attempted to reach out to her the other night.  She wasn't having any of it.
She's scared. She may have reason to he. I was even surprised she got into Braverman emails.She often surprised me with her in depth questions. I unsub from Webb's channel a few hours ago. Some of the members were ruthless. No one said one thing about Webb's behavior knowing she was susceptible to manipulation. One of the members befriended her to get private information,  and he spewed it all out in the forum. He betrayed her. So I called him out harshly and left the group.

                Wendy has gotten files of mine and is posting them 4/4\17
I had Hillary's personal phone book. A link to who murdered the Ramsey child., large Trump files. 
I find it strange hubby doesn't intervene and get her committed.  She is hoping for the day to martyr herself for Webb.

                Yes. I don't know if they are groupies or victims. The woman Wendy is jealous of is Dana Newton.  She's the one he's going to turn first before he and a Wendy meet. Dana is a victim.  Carla Vegas also has a connection to Webb She did some things for Webb in Vegas.  Not sure if her role. Carla is trying to get the group over to her site. Discord.

                There's few who will question his motives, his public stance he's a Zionist, I believe he has dual citizenship. 
If one questions Webb outside the stated format, the group will not tolerate it!

               It is sickening to me that George manipulated her so, she was obviously vulnerable. All one has to do is read their exchange.

                There's no doubt he's affiliated. I was suspicious from the week I subscribed.  I have been watching since around video 20!
Gwen gave me all the info as it was  happening. You read her posts. She said she would never contact him again. I told her I felt she escaped with her life. I did not know she was still chatting with him.  I was gone from the 6th to the night of the 9th. I checked for messages and that's when I found out she had fallen apart.

              Bluebird, it's good to ask questions... At first it didn't bother me who he "worked for" because I was learning a lot but it's getting more and more difficult to deny that something else is going on.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is a dangerous game and I think it's best not to "contribute" to his research any more.

              even if he is working for Russia (btw, who in Russia exactly?)... how does that delegitimize him? if his info is truthful and accurate, who really cares who hes working for?
             </p>
             <p>
              if he was purposefully put there for disinfo or //slanting the narrative//, wouldn't it be a much better idea to just not put him there and not put out anything?

               I think the concern is he may be recruiting to run these ops against the US, as he mentioned he was at those brownstone parties of Epstein's on NY and the island. Gwen was inquiring about him being a Russian agent throughout these chat sessions.

               Yeah, I know, I thought that too, and he mayve just been filling her fulla crap about working for Russia, but for whom he works has always bugged me because he is not going to put out any scurrilous info that implicates whomever it is, even if it furthers the investigation. I still think it might be Obama. I am the type of person who wants ALL the facts laid out, then I can make my own decision about that info. I dont like to be duped. George has good info but I've noticed when some of his info sounds really unbelievable, and when people question him on it, he will back away from it. He has also contradicted himself on his personal life a few times. How can one man have been in so many different fields of work? He's written a book, He's worked on computers, he's been a journalist, he's gone undercover, he's done this and that. To be quite honest, after following and observing him since Day 20, and since reading the obvious crap he was giving to Wendy, I think he is a con man. Is his info good? A big part of it is, yes, and I appreciate the info he has put out there, but he himself, I do not trust. I seriously doubt the JTTF story as well. If McCabe wanted him dead, he would be dead, UNLESS he has some major protection. Anyway, doesnt matter.
              </p>
              <p>
               No skin off my back if people follow him; not my business. I hope he eventually brings all the elites down, but I'm done with him.

                Wendy always called Webb out on who "they" are.  He always referred back to the Czech writer.  She did not stop asking who they are.

            In this tweet it's clear George isn't in this because he cares about getting justice for suffering children. He's in this for some perverted power play

              I can assure you mr. V____Z is a very hard working person that causes great damage to the cause.

              He'll slide along ,says sensible things,gains trust from less experienced posters,gets lot's of upvotes. .
             </p>
             <p>
              But when you get too close for comfort,he'll steer you away.

              I like these kind of Brock army sicko's,cause whenever these start attacking,you're on the right track.

              Love them,they're doing great work by deduction.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just keep warning those who fall nto the trap.

                Why did shachalnur tell Gwen he fathered his sister's two children? Sick, right?  Watch out for this guy. He's threatened me a couple of times. He was manipulating Gwen telling her what kind of Jew he is. Sex abuse is normal in middle east. Said he was abused. Using everything possible to manipulate her. He caused a big problem on Webb's channel saying Gwen varied career makes her some kind of operative.  He said he lives in UK. This guy is bad news. If he threatens me again,  He's done on voat and every other social site.

                         Nothing. Someone is messing with me again making me believe things that are false. I have a stalker. Please understand...i  have done nothing to hurt anyone and I prefer to keep away, not converse with online people right now.

                    Thank you, I'm fine.
You might want to be more carefull with sharing your knowledge with just anybody.
I've got this dcdale dildo stalking me ,saying disgusting stuff about me,claiming she saw conversations we had.
Hope you're a bit more stable now.
You obviously have inside knowledge and repressed memories about important issues,but you have to organize your thoughts,separate facts and suspicions and release only things you're sure about.
I'm sure you are trying to do good,but too erratic to be taken serious,and might cause damage to people who are not criminals.
My advice still is:calm down,focus and be patient.
If you need my advice or help with anything,just contact me,and I'll try helping with whatever I can.
Because I do believe ,with whatever is hurting,damaging or bothering you,you are a good person.

               Every single one of them mentions lists of people together and tries to group them all into the same boat, ie. seaman, frost, aj, cernovich, RDS, Webb, VL, etc.

                 After looking through a lot of his submissions, it seems like he's a CPP gatekeeper. He posts non-stop about comet and shit, all while bashing AJ, Webb, and any other name in the process.

                  "and any other name" what other names are you referring to here? I have been anti-Webb and anti-Jones since i've known of them both. However i defend David Seaman (alone, albeit) every chance that comes up, because i've trusted him since i've known of him, since 2011.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I do see people make comments where they bunch people together, but that doesn't describe me. I see similarities with Webb and Jones, so i do sometimes mention them together.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Y'all have fun with your theorizing though.

                   Anybody can put a picture on any given contact in their contact list and have the second number send the first any amount of text with any type of information in it.

                   I'd rather be skeptical of claims such as these. A random lady poking her head out from no where without any prior reputation really throws me off.

                      shachalnur is spreading incorrect info. I checked out every one of his claims. Not one checked out. He tried to manipulate Wendy. This guy told her he fathered his sister's two children!!!  Said he was abused. Said sex abuse is normal in Middle  East. Told her hes a Jew who reads the bible. What sick game is he playing?

                             If Webb is correct...Kissinger order the release of Humas' emails?  In order to 'clip hillarys wings', but this went sideways and trump won.
                             <br/>
                             It seems like Gwen is a groupie, possibly MK...idk, but I'm guessing Webb has naked pics of her, or compromising pic's and she freaked when her daughter got in a car accident...

                              Did you google the exact text?
i don't understand what the picture is doing under that images search,because it's a different name,and they doing different things and didn't go to the same school.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              first try to google exactly what I said,,the picture doesn't show up otherwise.
if that doesn't work ,I'll give you another clue,simply can't out the name without being sure there's a connection.

                                then to images,and on the 8th line of pictures,there's a black and white pic that looks familiar.

                               <p>
                                click it and read her history on a site called alumnius.net(if your google images doesn't give the picture ,her name is Misty B.(bishop) Whiteford)

                                google misty bishop whiteford,and you'll find the same pic,the same pic that was there yesterday on equinox website and seems to be gone now.

                                What was strange is that she had no activities as a personal trainer in equinox acc to the equinox website,while working there for 6 years
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                No problem because her working history is clear:
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                first doing "" nothing "until she's almost 30,with a university degree
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                then started working for Elie Tahari,who's dressing Hollywood stars,and complete access to important people.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                then went to equinox as personal trainer,which is way lower than her elie tahari job..
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                if you search equinox website ,watch the introduction movie carefully,
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                Abeku wilson ,the miami equinox killer is there in the movie.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                his history says he lived in NY,so there's probably a connection with equinox ny,where this woman also works for 6 years.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                the rest you can research yourself.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                basically ,this Misty shows up on google search when I look for wendy doster pediatrician virginia,she very much looks like a younger wendy.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                she is strongly connected to elie tahari(but wendy is friends with a supervisor at elie tahari on facebook) and equinox.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                the day wendy started outing george ,abeku wilson shot janine ackerman from new jersey in equinox miami,allegedly
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                Misty works at equinox.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                too many coincidences,still don't understand how misty ,who is like twin with wendy,shows up when i search wendy doster pediatrician in virginia
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                misty grew up in virginia,lives in NY
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                wendy doster pediatrician grew up in virginia and stayed there,allegedly,but hardly any trace of this person to be found,except words.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                and our wendy grew up in NY,and lives in mineapolis,allegedly.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                what this means,I dont know,but something is odd.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                also wendy's facebook pictures are weird,she seems to get younger through the years,and never a pic with her girls together,always separate.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                Maybe she has more pictures and posts for friends only,don't know.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                also notice that almost all comments under the pics of the girls are about how much the girls look like her.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                who are they trying to convince?
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                Look,this might all be one big coincidence,and it's just strange that misty and wendy doster are connected on google images and look alike,misty works for equinox ,and wendy flips the same day abeku shoots janine ackerman from NJ
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                Also misty working for years for elie tahari,while wendy is friends with a supervisor there.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                And now it looks like misty is gone from equinox staff page ,while she was there yesterday.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                And my comment explaining how to find this person on GW YT is gone.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                you figure it out,i feel there's something there,and i'll keep looking,but they might be wiping things now.

                                  very little can be found of the history of wendy doster anyway,the trump connection,alleged,is easy to find ,and might be part of the forming of her identity as a honeypot..

                                 <p>
                                  wendy doster pediatrician's existence still remains to be proven,and also misty's history is vage  and she looks like wendy's twin ,or a younger version in some pictures ,not all.

                                  No not gonna post all this on YT,because I don't know george's role,victim or part of psy-op,and don't want to make a mess on his channel.

                                    so you just do it,and if the reaction is jail,without communication or a lawyer for 7 weeks,then i might be on to something.

                                  there's much more I found.

                                  but i don't know who removed my comment on GW YT.

                                 <p>
                                  half willow hills high school east in NY is interesting ,to see who wendy doster knows.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  And what would help if is anyone can find an image of wendy doster pediatrician in virginia.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  official documents of her existence are there,but no pics or any trace of her doing anything that can be checked.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  Also I don't like that I can't find the staff of equinox with info on misty's activities there,because it's gone now ,when yesterday it was there.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  this picture of young misty doesn't look exactly like the pictures of misty on her facebook,besides one or two.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  but for her profiles on search sites she uses that pic.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  and the connection virginia and NY is interesting.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  There must be a connection somewhere.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  I'll find it with time.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  wendy's language with george when she pulling info out of him is clearly debriefing skills,she used the same tone with me,when she was allegedly going crazy,and dumped me as useless, when she saw I was not gonna give her answers she liked to hear.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  I have strong doubts if the identity of our wendy doster is real.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  But then again; in the tweets george said he got into this investigation after he watched 10 seconds of the hillary tape(allegedly abusing someone).
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  that's a strong statement he would never be able to make on his YT videos.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  Still that statement came out,thanks to wendy.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  this whole wendy story smells like a psy-op ,but not sure who 's phucking who and why.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  maybe george has been had,but the result of this all is quite interesting.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  and so is the connection with equinox and the shooting of janine ackerman there
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  and janine,misty,wendy doster and george are all jewish
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  like me,so maybe i feel and see things differently.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  right now I'm being flattened on YT by other commenters.

                                 <p>
                                  don't mind,gave the instructions and the initials,did my job

                                       Fascinating stuff, shach. The comment section there is very strange. It's kind of nuts to find out that many there actually seem to have IC backgrounds. You (unlike me) seem to know what you're talking about too. I'm joe blo nobody that's been playing along because one: I know the pedo ring/gov stuff is real ever since reading Icke's Biggest secret. Never went full on reptile with my belief in his work but, damn lots of stuff panned out in 15 years since reading that book. 2: I'm interested in the narrative format that's going on since I'm a writer (not too many good creds; one story I did publish was coincidentally about the E smart abduction-- reading again it's like I already knew what I know now if that makes sense), and the webb show is something else. I've defended G quite a bit on his channel, but I'm start to smell fish.

                                       Just wondering your opinion,  since my identity on there, even tho I just use a letter as a profile name, would be pretty easily revealed, do you think it would be a good idea to close off the google doc I posted months back that had  a few hundred linked in profiles of D-cor sheriffs? I mean, I'm fine legally speaking, but shit's getting weird. Don't want a posse of sheriffs to show up at my house. Also, having to do with accts. The funny thing is that even a lot of the jo blows like me seem to be  using multiple profiles. I know that Mark Ayers guy uses at least 3.

                                       Also, concerning Wendy. Before reading your take, I kind of thought she was being more truthful than people were giving her credit for. And I thought it was strange how quick peeps wanted to dump on her. Now, I'm wondering if this is all part of GW's magical spy story. One thing I know for sure, is there is a production element going that's not apparent to the average viewer. It looks lo fi but is anything but. I also sense story arc. 
Edit: sorry for the long winded comment. I need to quit coffee as well as hire an editor.

                                        hello there.
take it easy on the tech and slang department.
I manage 7 languages but English is not my mother tongue,and i know nothing about docs ,uploads,copy paste and link.
maybe that's why i find stuff.
can't help you with your question,dunno
wendy is definitely a handfull and from DM's with her for a while,i get a feeling this girl knows a lot,gathered a lot of info,and this is maybe mixed with her remembering stuff she forgot.
fascinating stuff,but she's taking about dead kids and shit now.
i would be more at ease if anybody could prove these kids actually exist,and that Wendy is their mother.
she talks about hank doster now.i spotted hank days ago
and did you have a look at wolfgang schoelkopf?
my guess; there's more weird stuff coming.
Hope george has got it under control.

                                         Sorry about the slang. I was talking about the google document I posted listing all the dyncorp sheriffs on linkedin. An yeah, I hope George does too. Thanks for reply. Also, 7 languages? Wow. I took years of spanish, but can still barely order a taco when I cross the border into mexico.

                             No. I looked at Equinox very briefly. Didnt even know there was a murder, never watch news. I havent had a chance to look. Will look when kids go to bed. Thanks for the clues.

                           Sorry to butt in, couldn't find your comments on 172.2...
Is there a way to verify if Webb knows Gwen is posting their pm's and still continues to pm with her?  Are you buying what Webb is saying in the PMs?

                             Hi again, shach. This will be shorter. I saw the question you posed to Wendy about GW's father. I now about him being an inventor and some about the guy's exp in WW2. But that seems to be the only background I can find on the guy, which seems weird since he seems to have been a pretty important person. I mean, his patents have a lot to do with how we're able to communicate right now. Do you know anything else about him beside the inventor aspect?

                              not too much,clever man and he and his wife gave the genes to george.
did you see her answer?
she acted like she didn't really know.
i'm not into investigating George, i just learn ,and add it to my own findings
wendy is a psy-op ,so i study that,because it might turn out to be important.
it seems it's personal and a lot of people involved.

                               I'm trying to do both. I'm better at nonfiction than journalism, and to me George and his show is a story I can work with. Looking for a way to tell it without lessening the very valid work he's doing. I mean, Mossad and Israel's role is quite noticeably missing from what's on YT, but most of the information he's relayed has checked out when I've looked into it.

               If you're serious, you must be delusional. This is precisely the thing they want; to stop you from doing research and instead focus on who to believe. The people that raise attention to things are still the people that raise attention to things, regardless of whether or not they have few and vague caveats in their personal involvement.
              </p>
              <p>
               We've known since the beginning that any players in this game will have dirt and all it takes is exposure. We need to decide what we're willing to put up with in terms of these smears, and what we're not. We can't lump everyone into "with us" or "against us" categories. If you're not a bot, and you're not paid, you understanding what I just said only to ignore it means that you're not going to be a good fit here. So, you're probably wasting your time, you're not getting paid enough for this shit, or you genuinely just don't understand what's actually happening here. Maybe it's not limited to those things, or it could even be a mixture. But, the more you post and only focus on smears, the more fishy you'll become.
              </p>
              <p>
               Let's outline what people that would be paid to disrupt us (like shareblue and shit) would actually want from us:
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                <p>
                 They want us to be confused
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 They want us to fight each other
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 They don't want us to research
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 They don't want us to cooperate
                </p>
               </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
               What you're doing helps them, and it doesn't' help us.
              </p>
              <p>
               What can we do to counter the shills? Keep each other composed, keep researching, and keep ourselves and people we know safe. The moment we stray from these things and give in to what they want (disagreements like this) is the moment we're sabotaging not only our personal investments here, but those of us that have been helping each other continue in this, along with the efforts that people who aren't involved with us have been making.
              </p>
              <p>
               Pointing fingers will get us nowhere, especially if we aren't pointing fingers at people who are
               <strong>
                actually

                Actually the only one dichotomizing here is you, in the above statement which is a mischaracterization of my comments. Webb and Jones are not "everyone" and they barely make a lump. They both qualify for the statements i'm making. I've said this about them both the whole time i've been on Voat, and most people get really angry with me for it.

                Limited hangouts, disinfo agents, and predators of any sort are very dangerous to our fledgling truth community, and we have all the forces against us: Brock, Soros, Podesta, Clinton. It is impossible to believe that they will not be engaging in some sort of

                So I have always made it my mission to out them no matter what kind of blowback I get. I said the same thing about Cenk for years and everyone hated me. But I was right.

                I notice there are some people you aren't allowed to criticize, and I find that suspect. Webb has an awful lot of fierce defenders, a higher percentage than normal by at least 3X. So I continue to think he is a well paid operative to string us along and AWAY from the high level perps pizzagate revolves around.

                  In this tweet it's clear George isn't in this because he cares about getting justice for suffering children. He's in this for some perverted power play

                 You're saying he's "not in this" because the dude can't jerk off in his own home? You then parrot the smears like all the shills, and say they shouldn't participate in something

                 Webb has defenders because he brought light to ratlines and other intricacies in the investigation. He admitted a while back that he did a brownstone op to investigate fishy shit he was curious about/familiar with. Isn't it funny how not too long after he confessed that he did this, someone came along and brought the exact thing he mentioned people use to blackmail politicians and such up about him?

                 These aren't hard dots to connect. Quite wasting your time trying to "out" the bigger players. They're doing more work than you, even if they have suspicious pasts or questionable opinions about things. Every fucking one of us does.

                 You're looking at all the missing tiles, instead of taking shelter under the ones that exist. Quit thrusting your naivete around everywhere.

               But you seem to be implying that he is fallible and human, because of this we must dismiss him and his information, cause they are "bad for this cause"... dont try to David Seaman this guy too, anybody who spreads info is a hero anybody who tries to keep us quiet is the enemy, ...again...no mater the argument, more info out the better, credibility is not what got us here, is truth, there is no credibility except what the authority allows you to have, they will try to destroy your reputation if they think you care. ...a third time... more info good, less info in the media is bad

                This man is engaging in a conversation with a married woman who is trying to help the investigation along, she keeps trying to bring it back the point, and encouraging him to get back to his important work, while he is essentially promising to release Intel in exchange for pictures and sexting. That is all kinds of fucked up. He is a predator, and since he is focussing his attention on pizzagaters, it becomes by business. I am furious with him.

               I am wondering if the person in the PM talking to Webb really is this lady?
I see a someone who is  trained, like a cop. Questions are too direct. IMO!
Unless I am missing something?

               I thought the same thing. One thing that piqued my interest: On one of them she posted, her post comment was something like "Oh well, Americans are voyeurs". Since she is supposed to be American, I just found that odd. The whole thing is weird and may all be psyops. Done with George.

                  She is starting to sound like that Catherine Agnew. That is why it is dangerous to mess around with these supposed mystery "I have info, from secret people" guys.
Keep your daughter close, and always be on guard.

              I don't know or care who this bitch is either. It's all bogus distraction like worldCorp. We need to find human victims in the flesh not trace the ownership of a website obviously.

               That sounds like you believe the texts are real. I'm no fan of Hillary Clinton but the accusation she used a dildo on the head of the Clinton Foundation is loony tunes. And actually really fucking funny given all the weird shit we've seen. And all apologies to any men out there who have been raped anally with a dildo by a 70 year old woman.

                This type of stuff has been said about Hillary for a long, long time. That she's extremely sexually abusive to both females and males. It's been said on the MK ultra whisteblower victim types but those accts are becoming more plausible day by day. Sexual dominance and/or sex magic is central when dealing with the occult. And Hillary, whether dildo stories are true are not, is definitely in to the occult. Also, Webb hasn't made any claims about these messages being faked. The writing sounds a lot like him too.

                 I know. I thought the same thing. It's just so insanely random and bizarre to say Hillary would do such a thing. And who would tolerate it? Eric Braverman has a great education and could get a job anywhere he wanted. It's absurd to believe someone would sign up for ass rape by a 70 year old woman.

                  Kissinger kids like Braverman,  Neil Brown, Obama are groomed all their life to assume high level positions.  A form of control?
Anyway, this is what I wanted to share. I don't have a link nor do I have the vid number. I remember Webb talking about the atrocities committed by Isreal on the Palestinans.  He mentioned the slaughter of entire towns by Israel and the the kidnapping of women and children for trafficking and organ harvesting. The men became prisoners and eventually organ donors. Webb goes on to talk about programs  the Israeli had. Impregnating women, the children would be given to couples in Isreal. Some would go to the US. Kissinger was involved as was the CIA. THE CIA kept their eye on the kids as they grew up. Kissinger kids! !
Now this info comes out in tiny bites over months. The kids go through a mind control MK Ultra? Then the time comes for their placements and they, boys, go before Kissinger and a sex act occurs with Kissinger.  Webb calls it their baptism.

                   Nothing would surprise me anymore. I would also point out that your comment leaves out some of the History about the formation of Israel. At least 4 Arab armies invaded the day Israel became a nation. It's common knowledge that the Arab Palestinians were told to leave their villages for 2 weeks to make it easier for those Arab armies to fight Israel. They didn't have to worry about killing any Arabs that way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Unfortunately for the Arabs those 2 weeks ended and Israel had won. They haven't let any of those Palestinians who voluntarily left to come back into Israel. There are two sides to every story.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   But the other stuff about Israel abusing the Palestinian refugees and God knows what else I'm sure it happened. It's absolutely horrible to see innocent people killed on both sides.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   And to be brutally honest I hope the Muslims never give up the Temple Mount. I'm a born again Christian and the New Testament goes into great detail about what happened up there. Besides the rampant corruption around selling salvation the Pharisees were sacrificing animals all day long up in the inner Temple court yard. Can you imagine what would happen if the Jews retook the Temple Mount and fired up the barbecue again?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   As a Christian I don't even want to think about what would happen this time. I'd be thinking the world would end shortly after.

                  It would be absurd if he wasn't black mailed also and/or grown up in this kabal type shit since birth. I'm not saying any of this is true. I'm short on belief. But what all of this sex crap seems to be about his creating a circle of blackmailed individuals. Oz only has power because of the curtains.  Also, when it comes to Hillary. Sounds like if you actually know first hand or have evidence against her, going against the grain of HRC may cost you your life.

                I obviously haven't wasted any time reading this.  But Hillary dildoing him wouldn't be more surprising than ritual human sacrifice.  Hazing often involves stuff up your ass or so I'm told.

            Watching the same thing. Don't know what to make of it yet. Look at timestamp...it's today. Yet she was berating and accusing Webb of attempted murder yesterday. How are they at completed odds with each other...and then having these kinds of conversations?

                 Never said he wasn't, DonkeyQuixote.  She lumped George Webb's name in the mix, and that's not enough reason for me to believe her claims about G. Webb (wasn't implying anything other than that).
                </p>
                <p>
                 She's not 'banned' (as far as I know), but sounded like she was trying to make posts that were blocked.  Assuming even that is true.  Right now I don't believe a word of her claims and think the entire Twitter event between the two of them is just a distraction.  Interesting for awhile...now I'm moving on.

                I see what you are saying, however there's a lot of info (or dis-info) in the texts between them. It appears they have some type of amicable and intimate (re: subject matter)) texting relationship. She may appear off the rails in some of her tweets, however we don't know the story...and we are dealing with some very dark disturbing stuff.
