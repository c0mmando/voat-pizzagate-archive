<p><strong>How Was Ex-Israeli Prime Minister Barak Tied to Epstein?</strong></p>
<p><em>short intro video: (02:17)</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhECcWNj6y0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhECcWNj6y0</a></p>
<h1 id="md-section"></h1>
<p>Barak, 77, served as prime minister from 1999 to 2001. This month he formed a new party to run for prime minister against Netanyahu, who called for new elections in September. </p>
<p>Once political allies, Barak and Netanyahu have been sparring on social media, with Netanyahu producing a video raising Barak’s relationship to the multimillionaire New York financier, and Ohio billionaire Les Wexner, who has given money to Barak, the Times of Israel reported.</p>
<p>Barak was a close friend and business partner with Epstein for years. Now some of those business partnerships are being scrutinized amid questions about Barak’s own source of wealth. The Times reported Saturday <strong>that Barak is exploring whether to sever business ties with Epstein, 66, who was charged last week with sex trafficking underage girls.</strong></p>
<p><em>(He is \'exploring\' \'whether\' to cut ties with a convicted pedo, who allegedly ran a sex trafficking ring - he must be joking.)</em></p>
<p>In 2015, Barak formed a limited partnership company in Israel to invest in a high-tech startup called Reporty, now named Carbyne., which develops video streaming and geolocation software for emergency services, the Times reported. <strong>A large part of the investment money was supplied by Epstein.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Barak also received $2.5 million from the Wexner Foundation in 2004 for research, which has never been fully explained, Haaretz reported. Epstein was a member of that foundation.</strong></p>
<p>Speaking on Israel TV’s “Meet the Press,” Saturday, Barak stated he had no idea that Epstein’s charges related to molesting underage girls and defended his business relationship with Epstein.</p>
<p><em>He was a friend, but didn\'t know that Epstein sexually exploited children, and what his past trial was about. Right. /s</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He’d served his sentence for soliciting prostitution — the indictment didn’t say she was a minor,” Barak said, adding that he wasn’t the only person who kept his friendship with Epstein after his arrest. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>\'Why are you calling me out - others did it as well!!\' /s</em></p>
<p>Epstein’s circle of associates included the presidents of leading U.S. universities, philanthropists, Nobel-prize-winning scientists and politicians from both American political parties, Barak said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The American system itself did not label him as a persona non grata…the secretary who just resigned in the Trump administration was the prosecutor and he said he’d been negligent — so you expect me to have noticed [anything wrong]?” Barak said on the program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>However, by 2011, it was widely known that Epstein’s crimes were far more serious than what he pleaded guilty to. Stories were written around the world about Epstein’s exploitation of underage girls and women, and part of the coverage included reports of trips that celebrities and other wealthy, politically connected people like former president Bill Clinton took on Epstein’s private jet, which was nicknamed “The Lolita Express.’’</strong></p>
<p>Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who was among those underage girls recruited by Epstein and his partner, Ghislaine Maxwell, has said that she was trafficked for sex to “academics and world leaders.’’ </p>
<p>Last week, the case drew renewed global media attention when federal prosecutors in New York unsealed an indictment against Epstein. Unsealing of the indictment followed the arrest of Epstein.</p>
<p>Israeli media have been closely watching the case and, in particular, waiting for the upcoming release of documents in a 2015 civil lawsuit that was brought by Giuffre against Maxwell. </p>
<p>A federal appeals court in New York earlier this month ruled that sealed documents must be made public in that case. Those documents could reveal names of other prominent people who were involved in Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking operation.</p>
<p><strong>Barak has been linked to Epstein for years, and questions have lingered over how much he knew, if anything, of Epstein’s possible underage sex trafficking network. Giuffre has said that Epstein had recruiters all over the world, and that she was often forced to lure young girls to have sex with Epstein when they traveled in other countries.</strong></p>
<p>Barak initially declined to confirm the report of the 2015 investment to Haaretz, saying he would not disclose the identities of private investors who worked with him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I saw a business opportunity and registered a partnership under my control in Israel,” Barak told Haaretz in comments published Thursday. “A small number of people I know are invested in it, in a commercial deal that benefited everyone. Since these were private investments, it would be inappropriate and wrong for me to reveal the identities of the investing parties.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Netanyahu took to social media, writing: “Investigate Ehud Barak immediately.”</p>
<p>Barak responded on Twitter: “You don’t have to investigate — I confess. I gave a second chance, both to Epstein and to Bibi [Netanyahu]. Both are now neck-deep in criminality. I expect both to recuse themselves until the truth is ascertained.”</p>
<p>Netanyahu is at the center of three criminal investigations into alleged corruption, which he denies.</p>

             Also, he might be involved with organ trafficking from Kosovo. There's an Israeli connection there.

             Yep. But I don't trust Pieczenik for a minute. He's as deep state as it can get. He pretends to have flippped, but who knows.Imo he's a limited hangout. Note that he doesn't mention the CIA at all.

            ''I own you,'' she recalled his saying. ''You are my property and you will work until you earn your way out. Don't try to leave. You have no papers and you don't speak Hebrew. You will be arrested and deported. Then we will get you and bring you back.''"

              Started mostly with yugoslavian war and Dyncorp.  The majority of organ trafficking is in Asia.  Ive done a very full post about organ trafficking.. ill send it to you when I get to a computer.  The largest consumer of kidneys is saudi arabia.  There is also a strange kidney disease in rural asia that no one is talking about thats made demand in china skyrocket too.  I ll send sauce when i can.

               <p>
                Questions raised by the Zoe’s Ark and Silsby scandals regarding human and organ trafficking were fueled by connections in both incidents to Bernard Kouchner. In the Zoe’s Ark incident, French Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Human Rights, Rama Yade, oversaw aspects of the case and served at the time under Kouchner. The Guardian reported that Kouchner also personally contacted Idriss Deby during the Zoe’s Ark debacle to express “solidarity with the children.”

                "Le président de l’Arche de Zoé vise nommément Bernard Kouchner, son «étonnant silence» sur l’affaire, lui qui avait fait du «drame du Darfour» la «priorité de son mandat». La lettre mentionne également une rencontre en juin dernier entre Eric Breteau et un proche conseiller de Bernard Kouchner, «Laurent Contini». Ce dernier aurait déclaré à l’époque: «Votre projet de sauvetage des orphelins du Darfour est intéressant, il va sans doute provoquer une crise internationale et une réunion du Conseil de sécurité de l’ONU, ce qui donnera une nouvelle légitimité au ministre Kouchner de s’exprimer sur le sujet du Darfour après le fiasco du “corridor humanitaire”» que l’ex-French doctor avait évoqué"

                "Au-delà des responsabilités juridiques qui pèsent sur les acteurs de l’Arche de Zoé, y a-t-il une responsabilité morale dans cet imbroglio ? Oui. Elle repose sur les épaules de ceux qui, forts de leur statut intellectuel et de leur présence sur la scène publique, ont installé l’idée que tous les enfants de cette région étaient à court terme condamnés à mort et qu’une guerre génocidaire était en cours. C’est d’ailleurs ce qu’on peut lire sur le site de L’Arche de Zoé : « 800 000 enfants vont mourir avant la fin de l’année… » Des enfants broyés, démembrés, jetés dans les puits : ce sont des images évoquées par des gens comme Bernard Kouchner et Bernard-Henri Lévy qui se réclament d’une expérience de terrain et qui, de retour à Paris, mobilisent afin d’élever le niveau de conscience en vue de provoquer une intervention armée internationale au Darfour."

               <p>
                CNN reported in 1999 that a UN human rights official stated that human rights abuses had occurred “in the presence of UNMIK,” which Kouchner headed when he served as head of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) during the conflict. The CNN report was based on statements made by Dick Marty, who called for further investigation into claims that the KLA under Hashim Thaci’s leadership had participated in organ trafficking. The Guardian wrote in 2010 that: “Kosovo’s prime minister is the head of a “mafia-like” Albanian group responsible for smuggling weapons, drugs and human organs through eastern Europe.” These strongly worded claims were made in a Council of Europe report that relied in part on information from the FBI and other intelligence sources. NBC stated that Kosovo had responded to the publication of the report with threats of legal action. The Guardian also discussed an internal UN document that described UN forces in Kosovo committing illegal acts and recruiting from the KLA, which as we have seen, was reported to have been a “mafia-like” group with connections to organized crime. They wrote: “The U.N.’s own damning verdict on its newly created civil defense force is fresh evidence of the failure of Special Representative Bernard Kouchner.” Once again, such admonishments of UN forces even by the UN’s evaluation, sends a clear message that current levels of oversight in humanitarian efforts are severely lacking. The KPC under Kouchner was a UN-backed, UN-funded civil defense corp. It was manned by many high ranking members of Thaci’s KLA. This was exemplified by General Agim Ceku, formerly a senior commander in the KLA who then served as the leader of the KPC. Ceku was personally accused in a internal U.N. document of supervising a “forced prostitution racket” among other abuses. The Guardian wrote that the KPC had received a “£30 million aid budget for Kosovo” from the UN. Such blurred boundaries were implied again when Serbian media reported that Kouchner reacted angrily to accusations from police officials claiming that Kouchner “must have had knowledge” of documented organ trafficking. Even with UN-backing, the KPC was accused of participation in serious human rights abuses. The Guardian reported that the KPC had participated in mafia-like activities including murder, torture, and sex trafficking networks, particularly those perpetrated by UN peacekeepers and paramilitary groups hired by the UN such as Dyncorp. To this day, no charges have been brought in the Kosovo court. The Schwendimann dude has just been replaced by Jack Smith.

                Kouchner was also known for his testimony offered in defense of Michael Sounalet, who was eventually convicted on charges of pedophilia. Media reports described Kouchner’s “vigorous” defense testimony provided on Sounalet’s behalf against pedophilia charges in Romania. Despite Kouchner’s testimony, the 67-year-old humanitarian aid worker was eventually convicted on charges of sexual perversions and corruption of minors. Kouchner’s defense of Sounalet provides another concerning the murky boundaries between aid groups and allegations of abuse. Sounalet served as a humanitarian worker with Doctors Without Borders, the group which Kouchner had co-founded. French Media outlet Liberation reported that Kouchner had called Sounalet’s work a “model for international bodies.” This raises serious questions as to delineation between NGO’s, those who participate in such groups who are accused of abuses, and the intercession for the accused by prominent political figures who often have close ties to the NGO’s in question. Sounalet’s history prior to the pedophilia accusations in Romania was also alarming. Le Parisen reported that Sounalet spent 35 years of a life sentence in French prison after being convicted on charges of armed robbery. French press also reported that while incarcerated, Sounalet made contact with a Columbian drug trafficking cartel. Despite this history, Sounalet had participated in “humanitarian efforts” in locations including Rwanda, where he “looked for survivors of the families of two hundred orphans,” organized the placement of those children, and photographed them. Sounalet was reported to have also expressed admiration for Jean-Louis Machuron, who served as the first President of Doctors Without Borders until 1996. Kouchner’s defense of a convicted pedophile who had worked for the NGO he founded raised serious concerns regarding why such a person was allowed to work for an aid group in the first place, much less defended by its co-founder. Machuron was not only President of the NGO Kouchner co-founded which hired an employee convicted of sex crimes against minors. Machuron had worked with Bernard Kouchner as a consultant at the French Ministry of Health, leading several missions for the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, notably in Albania and in Kosovo in the late nineties, where he worked with the French military and international corps. This took place at the time that Kouchner served as the personal representative of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Anan as head of UN efforts Kosovo.

                <p>
                 I havent found anything relating her directly to Dyncorps sex trade, organ harvest in Bosnia and Kosovo and Croatia.. but she was in the circles of power at that place at 2002, in Belgrade, Serbia.. acting as liason to major donor countries and she interacted between embassies and international organizations representatives.... I find it difficult to believe that she wouldn't have known what was going down... Following section for context : some info about the horrors of the UN mission in Bosnia..backed up by Dyncorp..
                </p>
                <p>
                 The OSCE Mission in Kosovo (OMIK) was established in supoprt to the UN UInterim Mission (UNMIK). The 500 American mebers of the UNMIK police were Dyncorp employess under contract from the US State Department..DynCorp; Vinnell, a subsidiary of TRW; SAIC; ICI of Oregon; and Logicon, a unit of Northrop Grumman For information reasons..

                 </a>
                 The OCSE chose WHO got sent to Bosnia/Yougoslavia..Resumés were collecterd and studied and only the finest pedophiles were sent.. In Bosnia, employees of DynCorp were found to be operating a sex-slave ring of young women who were held for prostitution after their passports were confiscated. In Croatia, local forces, trained by MPRI, used what they learned to conduct one of the worst episodes of "ethnic cleansing," an event that left more than 100,000 homeless and hundreds dead and resulted in war-crimes indictments. No employee of either firm has ever been charged in these incidents.

                <p>
                 After Bosnia.. Boell Foundation in Washington.. Think transgender agenda and feminazism..
The Boell Fondation does a lot of work with human trafficking especially in eastern countries. They also finance studies like this :
                 <a href="http://www.gaatw.org/books_pdf/Human%20Rights%20and%20Trafficking%20in%20Person.pdf">
                  http://www.gaatw.org/books_pdf/Human%20Rights%20and%20Trafficking%20in%20Person.pdf
                 </a>
                 Which are very good works.. They can also be used to synthetize what the current real situations are and show what legal tools are, which are being employed to combat the traffic.. certainly interesting info for someone involved in human trafficking either as a participant or someone who's fighting against it...
                </p>
                <p>
                 So what is she up to nowadays???

                  On the other hand.. it wasnt as if the United Nations wasnt aware that there were trafficking problems and that children were getting scooped up into sex trade/organ removal..

However.. I'm sure that there will be proper public investigation and everything will come to light...... "As well as having close ties to the Clintons, Hashim Thaci can be linked to the lobbying firm the Podesta Group. Under the Thaci government, the Podesta Group was hired by the Ministry Economic Development for their services. The Podesta group was paid $50,000 a month after signing a contract in March 2012."

From 1995 to 2003, Sullivan served in various capacities at the US Departments of State and Defense. In 2001 he was appointed political advisor to the NATO Commander General in Kosovo and was later the NATO Secretary General’s personal representative to Serbia.".. Frank Wisner Lobbying for Kosovo internationally through Patton Boggs: Wisner is an old Kosovo hand. The former US Secretary of State under George Bush, Condoleezza Rice, appointed him the US’s special representative to the Kosovo Status Talks in 2005.

                 <p>
                  The Clintons and their inner circle have historical connections to the KLA and continued relations with the former head of the KLA, Hasim Thaci, despite substantial evidence that the miltant group participated in organ harvesting, heroine trafficking and other criminal, 'mafia-like', activities. Meanwhile, the CIA supported and funded islamic terrorists in Afghanistan, who later supported the KLA in Kosovo and together allied with the US/NATO bombing campaign in the region. The Clinton administration seemed to have no problem working with al-Queda and the KLA as long as they achieved US objectives.

                   (as a side note... Anyone remember Sarkozy and Hillary getting in on in Libya.. we came, we saw, he died, cackle cackle cackle...) (Clinton went to Paris in March 2011 to meet with Mahmoud Jibril the Libyan Rebel Leader. 1 month after Gaddafi had massacred 1000 civils in an uprising earlier that year, she also met with Sarkozy as well. Where they probably planned the overthrow and assassination of Gaddafi.. (Gaddafi may probably escaped if his convoy hadnt been explosed by Drones and French Rafale Jetplanes..)

                   "According to sensitive information available to this these individuals, Qaddafi's government holds 143 tons of gold, and a similar amount in silver. During late March, 2011 these stocks were moved to SABHA (south west in the direction of the Libyan border with Niger and Chad); taken from the vaults of the Libyan Central Bank in Tripoli.....valued at more than $7 billion. French intelligence officers discovered this plan shortly after the current rebellion began, and this was one of the factors that influenced President Nicolas Sarkozy's decision to commit France to the attack on Libya."

                   Clinton's brother, Tony Rodham, was a board member of a North Carolina mining company that enjoyed prime access to Haitian gold deposits in the wake of post-earthquake relief work organized in part by former president Bill Clinton through the Clinton Foundation. Another board member of the firm, VCS Mining, was former Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, who co-chaired the charitable Interim Haiti Recovery Commission with Mr. Clinton.

                    Kouchner also showed great interest in serving in Haiti in a U.N. role. Shortly after the Silsby scandal, a 2011 email exchange between Hillary Clinton, Melanne Verveer(Previously, Verveer served as the Chair and Co-CEO of Vital Voices Global Partnership, which she co-founded with Hillary Clinton in 2001,She is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission and the World Bank Advisory Council on Gender and Development) and Cheryl Mills (remember she got immunity from FBI for the Clinton Email investigation under COMEY....) published by Wikileaks stated that Kouchner was “considering” a position as UN Special Representative to Haiti.

                    The role Kouchner considered in Haiti would have mirrored previous humanitarian service in Kosovo. Kouchner is not only a prominent political figure with close ties to the Clintons and their associates; he has personally co-founded NGO’s and charitable organizations including Doctors Without Borders, again illustrating the blurred boundaries that are associated with humanitarian aid.

                     "The little-known Haiti Development Fund, an LLC incorporated in Delaware in August 2010, was created by the Clinton Foundation with an initial endowment of $20 million from shady Canadian mining mogul Frank Giustra and Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim." The for-profit Fund was managed by Jean Marc Villain, who was going through a bankruptcy in 2010 when he was working for the Clinton Foundation.

                     "“This cries out for an audit or an investigation,” said Ken Boehm, chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center a Virginia-based watchdog group. “Its director was in bankruptcy and there’s almost nothing in the public record showing what happened to the millions of dollars it supposedly was going to use to help poor Haitians.”"

                     Charity involvement in child and organ trafficking is a concerning issue; these concerns were repeated in 2010, this time in Haiti with the Laura Silsby child debacle. The accusations mirrored similar comments made by the Prime Minister of Haiti in an interview with CNN where he accused American NGOs of removing children for the express purpose of selling them to pedophilia and organ trafficking rings.

                     (Also.. The current debacle began with the revelation of sexual abuses by Oxfam’s Country Director in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake devastated the island nation. The allegations eventually led to the expulsion and banning of Oxfam Great Britain from the country.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/timeline-oxfam-sexual-exploitation-scandal-in-haiti for F*** sake the SAME GUY was doing the SAME THING in LIBERIA (remember LIBERIA??) in 2004!!!

                     This is not the first time that a member of Oxfam would be swept up in a highly publicized sex abuse scandal. British press reports indicate that Caroline Thomas, who became Chair of Oxfam in 2016, previously served as an executive at BBC during the emergence of the Jimmy Saville pedophile revelations.

                     Sarkozy’s intervention in the Zoe’s Ark debacle was echoed by Bill Clinton’s intercession in the Laura Silsby scandal. Silsby was caught in 2010 in the midst of an attempt to remove children – many of whom were revealed to have had living relatives- from Haiti under the guise of ‘charitable’ efforts with The New Life Children’s Refuge. Clinton was acting as the U.N.’s special envoy to Haiti at the time and his intervention in the Silsby incident was one of his first official acts after arriving in the country.

                      You may have heard of her.. but have you actually read her blog article for humantraffickingcenter.org ? Talking about criminal gangs trafficking children across borders? (sound familiar?) :

Further, the current position of Congress and the Obama administration – to overhaul the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act and deny fair trials that recognize refugee, asylee and trafficking victim statuses – is unacceptable for a nation claiming to lead the global fight against trafficking in persons.

                      one of Monica's last messages that she sent to a friend.. "I can’t say to what extent, but there is human trafficking happening through the Clinton’s Caraol Complex. And mining has always been historically linked to trafficking, slavery, and labor exploitation. I’d like to go see for myself who’s laboring at Morne Bossa, but I would hypothesize that the Dominicans are doing the contractual oversight of the mining, while marginalized Haitians are being exploited for low or no cost labor in dangerous mining conditions. That’s two huge human trafficking scandals, an environmental degradation scandal, a social displacement scandal, a Presidential election scandal, a scandal with billions in unaccounted for earthquake aid… all leading directly back to the Clintons racist cronyism in Haiti.”

                      This is another good summary on poor Ms Petersen which gives more info on the Clinton's agitations with the Caracol Industrial Complex :

                   Another company involved with Kouchner's Zoe's ARK- French Four Wheeled Drive Federation- joined with Zoe's ARK in '04, presumably to supply the vehicles required to transport the children after the tsunami on Boxing Day. Their aim was to raise funds in France and work with the UN to create a village in Banda Aceh as a refugee for some of the 50k orphans thought to have been made so after the tsunami. The leaders were Guillaume Catala, one of the founders of ARK, and Eric Breteau, a former Fireman and president of the Four Wheeled Federation.

In Bosnia, employees of DynCorp were found to be operating a sex-slave ring of young women who were held for prostitution after their passports were confiscated. In Croatia, local forces, trained by MPRI, used what they learned to conduct one of the worst episodes of "ethnic cleansing," an event that left more than 100,000 homeless and hundreds dead and resulted in war-crimes indictments.

                  Lol. I was writing about that when my phone cut out. Yes. He also Co signed a doc with Biden and that woman who was in the email "bring all available children"  where she was inviting people to a roast out.. but they had fresh tortillas shipped in from mexico..she used to work in kosovo, then went into gender stuff.. now working for the inter american bank or something... fuck, the ceo is part of the order of the golden fleece.  I need to get back to my notes.  Will respond properly.  Here... old article.  But interesting how she notes that all the girls looked like they walked out of a lingerie catalogue.  Victorias secrets indeed.
