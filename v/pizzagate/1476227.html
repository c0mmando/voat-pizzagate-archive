            If people want to get to the bottom of the Besta Pizza logo, the best idea is to find out who designed the logo and sign. Did they do it themselves or hire someone to design their signage and branding? If the latter, perhaps someone could politely contact that designer and simply ask whether or not they came up with the logo on their own or Besta Pizza asked that they include the triangular shape into the logo.

            I wish these assholes would quit calling these people/businesses like they have a right or moral obligation to.  It's harassment plain and simple and I hope they get arrested for it.

             nothing illegal about calling and asking a question about a logo, or anything else for that matter. as long as no threats are made. the idea that it is, is what worries me. these people should all be answering questions. the longer they dodge it, the more concern will be raised.

               Asking any question, of any one is legal. and, those of us who want a free world, value this fact. people who can not proudly stand up and say who they are and what they are about, are recidivists in self imposed prisons.

                The fact that he did not call for a legitimate business reason is why the call is harassment.  And everything this fucking douche said was stupid.  Be honest, are you this paint huffing guido?  You seem to be REALLY defensive of him and his actions.  And based on your messages here, you clearly aren't any smarter.

                 no he does not have to answer. but he reveals a lot by refusing to, and getting upset. That is the power of the question. why would anyone not want to answer such concerns? if i thought it would help, even a bit, i'd be there all day...

                   i know an innocent person would have handled that call differently. that is all i need to know here. it comes down, to one or the other. an innocent person would say, come and look, and see for yourself, i have nothing to hide. they would let themselves be discounted as a cause for concern, so the case can better be solved. whereas this besta guy, it is all about him. sorry to disappoint you. i have this affect on a lot of people...

                Look mope, you can't ignore the entirety of the phone call. First, the employee this paint huffer was talking to was not the owner. Second, it's nobody's business why he changed the logo. Third, this fucking guido didn't call for the purpose of actually ordering a pizza so that means he isn't a customer.  He's not a journalist.  What he was doing is definitely harassment and I hope Besta prosecutes.  The very second he said he wanted the Podesta special it became harassment.

                 only an owner would field those question. any one lower in the chain, would not have done that. and only a guilty person, with a lot to hide, would have been put out, by such mild mannered caller.

              Are you kidding me?  How many children did he save with that call?  He sounded like he had the IQ squishy toy and almost everything he said was rude and ignorant.  You do realize he started the call with a fake pizza order to a fake address, right?  That's a criminal act by itself.  Everything after was him being an asshole.

               he further exposed Besta. added to what is already known, it does not look good for them. the more truth, the more children helped. which is why innocent people do not mind answering any questions.

            NOBODY SHOULD BE CALLING THESE PLACES. It is harassment by definition. They're a pizza place and sell pizza. Anyone calling and asking about logos is harassing the business. It's not the fact the caller is polite or rude, YOU DO NOT CALL THESE BUSINESSES! PERIOD.

             other people liked it. i am just going with the numbers. thank you for you opinion on it. but i really think it is important to ask questions, and this is not harassment. The Besta guy, is the one harassing and insulting and calling people terrible things. it reveals a lot about them. a behavioral expert would probably class it as an embedded confession. at any rate, we do not have many comments from them to go by, so we need all we can get. If they made statements, and answered the concerns about them, people would not feel the need to ask. until they do, we need to ask more. the better the format the better the results.

              The caller is harassing the business! They are not getting one stupid call like this, they are getting hundreds! Picture yourself getting a stupid call from an even stupider caller asking why you're a pizzagater. Now picture yourself getting flooded with these calls! To get angry is a NORMAL, HEALTHY REACTION TO BEING HARASSED. The fact that you don't get it is troubling. They have no obligation to answer stupid questions. None. DO NOT CALL THESE BUSINESSES. Do not post videos of people calling these businesses!

                And they shouldn't be getting ANY calls! That's the point. Even one is too many unless the owner is contacted by a journalist .. with credentials! JOURNALISTS have the right to call and REQUEST an interview. The interview is not necessarily granted, but that's the procedure. These people have been receiving death threats! I've seen them online and it's not right! They are not charged with anything, nor have they been found guilty in a court of law. Obviously, I believe what is said in the emails to be disturbing enough to warrant an investigation. The authorities seem unwilling to do that -- even where a creepy old grandmother (Luzzatto) is tossing her grandchildren into the pool for swim time with adults! And the emails hint that it's a revisit, as in, "WE'VE DONE THIS BEFORE"! That's hard evidence and journalists/authorities should be investigating. Since they're not, we are, but that doesn't make us the police or journalists. Further, we don't have the right to shut down a business based on conjecture. We should be smart enough to know that IF we dig up evidence, that justice will follow. We don't get to decide to remove someone's livelihood until that happens.
               </p>
               <p>
                NO CALLS ... NONE! It's stupid, it's harassment, and it won't get you anywhere!

               If they are innocent, they should be glad to set the record straight. Or they could just respond to the concerns in the first place. I am curious to know what their reason for changing the logo is, aren't you? Calling the caller a pedophile for noticing the symbol, and saying the things about his mother, are not healthy or normal reactions. The Besta guy lost his cool, and revealed himself. That is what guilty people do. There is no pressure, if no guilt. There is a glad opportunity to show the truth. I would say to every caller, I am glad you asked. we do not have anything to do with that, sand you can see for yourself, anytime. if I was innocent.  I do not think anyone should show indignity about these questions. I would answer question all day long, if it will help an investigation into the safety of children!

                No, if they are innocent, THEY SHOULD NOT BE BOMBARDED BY CALLS!
               </p>
               <p>
                Are you innocent? Do you want people calling hundreds of times a day and asking if you're innocent? Stop presuming what other people should do or not do! When I'm at work, I'm expecting work-related calls! When a call or unsolicited email slips through the filter, I get furious because I don't have time for idiotic requests.
               </p>
               <p>
                Talking to an idiot over the phone is not a way to straighten things out! You just don't get it, will never get it, and I'm wasting my breath explaining this to you. So to those that have a brain and want to use it, and further, for those who don't want repercussions from idiots harassing businesses, DO NOT MAKE THESE CALLS, DO NOT PRESUME THE PEOPLE ANSWERING WON'T MIND ANSWERING STUPID QUESTIONS ABOUT LOGOS, AND DO NOT GIVE FODDER TO OPPONENTS TO SHUT DOWN WEB INVESTIGATIONS!

                 This is work related, or... don't they care that so many people think they are involved in harming children? A real business owner, would be keen to clear it up, not running scared from one question about the logo. i agree harassment is not a good idea, but this is not harassment. rather it is a case of them crying harassment falsely, to avoid answering questions. btw this sounds like the owner, or someone high up. a secretary would not have been so nervous...

                 as long as they keep acting indignant, people will never stop asking. it is simply not what innocent people would do. what is so preposterous about these questions? they are quite logical. if there is reason enough to doubt, then that is enough reason to investigate. Children should  be safe beyond any doubt. no amount of phone answering, should be a burden. people are right to be concerned. as long as we are not abusive, it should be perfectly within our rights to ask anyone we are not sure about.

                 not harassing at all. would only be harassing or feeling attacked, if like James Alefantis, he does not want to answer these questions, because there is no answer. why did he change that logo?
why do it surreptitiously? 
why not at least explain it afterwards?

            i do not condone harassment of any kind, and i feel it is only likely to get in the way of the truth. I do not feel this caller is harassing. these would not be hard questions, to someone who had nothing to hide. they are not hard questions, by any stretch. Companies usually issue statements when they change logos. unless they are doing it obsequiously. If so, why?  why not take the opportunity to say, "we saw it was similar to a pedophile symbol and wanted to show our condemnation of that, by changing our sign." This is an extreme response, to a light hearted call. The man at Besta says the most extreme insults and tries to act threatened and under a huge inquisition, when all he was asked was really one question. He claims he is going to send the police to the caller, but for what? it is a travesty, that they are trying to say it is wrong , to simply ask questions . They are using this absurd sense of victimisation, to avoid simply  answering the questions. If they were able to answer them, speculation would end.... We need to put together some questions ,and pose them, in ways that can not be called harassment, and see what their answers are.

             If you don't feel it is harassment you're an idiot.  I would say go ask them if THEY think it's harassment but I'm afraid you would.

              It was a false call of harassment, to avoid a question, that could not be answered. Why did he change that logo? What answer is there, except "we did not want to get caught" 
The innocent answer would be, as soon as we realised the association we changed it, because we want to show our opposition to pedophiles. 
Can you think of any other answer? but he did not say that....

               Do you agree yes or no that the caller had no intention of ordering a pizza?  If your answer is no, the call is a harassing phone call.  If your answer is yes, you're a moron.  I don't know how I can make this any clearer.  The fact that he ordered a pizza and gave a fake address... it's against the law.

                Of course. He was pretty clear about that. That was how he got him on the phone. Reporters do these things all the time, when seeking the truth. Usually they come to peoples door etc. This was just a phone call. Then he asked one simple question, and the Besta guy freaked. An investgator's dream response, really. This was their chance to explain the logo, and they missed it. He should have been upset with himself! The caller was very easy going. He had a perfect opportunity to give him a real answer. He instead revealed himself, by acknowledging it is a pedophile symbol, witthout the caller having said anything about that. These people are suspects, being protected by elements in the very agencies who should be stopping them. Do you not think they look guilty? That is not how innocent people would have responded, in my humble opinion.

              people quick to call people "idiots" and other insults,are usually the only ones, who suffer from idiocy. Just as, this person from Besta is quick to resort to insults. in debating terms, we call that a win. You have just conceded, thank you.  Why are you concerned so much about the rights of Besta pizza and not the children, who we still do not know, if they are safe? Many are missing. We should all gladly put our "rights" aside, in any way, that will expedite their safety. More people should be asking questions, until we know the answers. But it is not a violation of any right, anyway just to ask questions... it is perfectly natural, and only guilty people, really, find it confronting. Innocent people are glad of the opportunity.  This person should have offered and polygraph ages ago. An innocent person, would want to clear their name. well beyond guilty, IMO

               Did you just get done watching some detective show last night or something?  You have a wild, yet misguided, imagination.  This wasn't a debate.  It was some guido calling and harassing a legal business.  It's LEGALLY called harassment.
