            Whats the connection between any of the facts you mention?
           </p>
           <p>
            Your headline is not supported by anything in your post.

           <p>
            Event A happened.
            <br/>
            Later event B happened.
This does not prove A caused B.  It does not even indicate A caused B.
           </p>
           <p>
            This seems like a former employee of Podesta, networking.  You haven't even shown that nonpublic information is being discussed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also this guy wants the lawyer to meet Podesta, yet you put it the other way round.
           </p>
           <p>
            The SEC is investigating SunEdison for public statements it made to investors.  It is not investigating HRC or the Podestas.
           </p>
           <p>
            This article on the SEC investigation doesn't even mention insider trading
