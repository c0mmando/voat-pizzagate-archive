His show &quot;iCarly&quot; is full of sick innuendo, and we know the show\'s Twitter page once asked fans to send in pictures of their feet, while there is much evidence that Dan Schneider has a pedo foot fetish, evidenced by many weird and creepy scenes from the show.</p>
<p>What I just found out is, in one of the episodes of the show, the 2nd main character, Sam, actually gives out her phone number.  Not only that-- it\'s a real number that actually goes to a voicemail that says it\'s Sam from the show.</p>
<p>The number is 503-664-0452.  And the number takes voicemails.</p>
<p>Imagine how many kids called and left their phone numbers?  Isn\'t this the perfect ruse for sick pedos in power to get contact info for a bunch of little kids??! Who knows, some kids probably left their email addresses and maybe even real addresses and likely real names.  I actually did an experiment and called the number from a burner phone and left a message, but I never got a call back.</p>
<p>A couple more weird things.  When you search for information on this actual phone number, it shows as a number coming from BEAVER, Oregon.  <a href="https://validnumber.com/phone-number/5036640452/">https://validnumber.com/phone-number/5036640452/</a>  The show takes place in Seattle, Washington.  Not that it\'s relevant, but Beaver isn\'t even close to Portland, Oregon; it\'s over two hours away.  So why BEAVER, Oregon?  Perhaps you too are remind of sick Nickelodeon\'s show called &quot;Angry Beavers.&quot;  A little weird with all this beaver stuff, knowing that pedos (and even convicted child molesters) worked/work there.  The number also appears to be registered to Sam Puckett when looked up.</p>
<p>To take it a step further, some people are saying they called the number and were creeped out because someone picked up and didn\'t say anything.  These comments are under this youtube video:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6vQltjS5U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6vQltjS5U</a>.  That video is also how I found out about all of this.  I looked at a few other youtube videos specifically about Sam\'s phone number and didn\'t see anything noteworthy in the comments.</p>
<p>Here a some comments under the youtube video (I looked very far into the comment section and these were the ones that stood out):</p>
<p>&quot;I [called] too it was really creepy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;same it was kinda scary﻿.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I used face time not video but the phone option and I heard rustling I think someone was saying something I\'m not sure so I hung up﻿.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The phone number for Sam still works this year in 2019!!!&quot;  <strong>YEAH, that\'s pretty odd in itself, isn\'t it?? The show ended SEVEN years ago. But someone is still paying for this phone number and voicemail to be set up as character Sam\'s number?!</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Creepy. Someone picked up on Sam\'s phone but no one was talking﻿.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Omg sam left me a voicemail﻿.&quot;  
</p>
<p>&quot;I called Sam and she actually answered my call﻿.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I called the number and it was Dan Schneider asking for a look at my feet...weird :).&quot;  **Some of these are clearly jokes or lies, but who knows.
**
&quot;YEAH I CALLED HER SHE ANSWERED OR SOMEONE!!! AND WHEN I HUNG UP I SAW THE PHONE NUMBER WAS FROM OREGON?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;she answered me!!! No joke I promise you she did!!!!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I tried sam’s phone number and it was so creepy someone actually picked up but they didn’t say anything OMFG!!! Please don’t try it...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I just watched this and I called Sam\'s number and she actually answered , she stayed hello .I was so nervous and wasn\'t really expecting her to answer , that I hung up immediately<br />
I am serious﻿.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>There is at least one comment of a kid putting up their phone number and asking Sam to call them.</strong></p>
<p>Sure, this could all mean nothing.  But... it\'s kinda weird that the only show to ever do this is also one of the most perverted and innuendo-ridden shows from undeniable pedo-type-sicko Dan Schneider.  Who knows if this phone number was actually used to lure real kids.</p>
<p>I am still so happy that Dan Schneider was taken down in the midst of the MeToo movement.  It\'s not enough, as there were no criminal charges, but it\'s still a huge victory.﻿</p>',

            Nowhere near good enough. If he's not sitting in prison, he was not "taken down."

            I'm getting seriously depressed that more isn't happening. I smiled more than I have in a long time talking to a very close friend of mine who was abused by a man many, many years ago. She told me how as a young girl she cleaned dog crap off her shoe with her abuser's toothbrush, then put it back in the bathroom. She woke her sister that evening so they could both listen to him brushing his teeth while they laughed.
           </p>

            What I just described, is
            <em>

            going to be the only justice that victims are going to receive? I sure as hell hope not.
