            We don't have to put up with this shit. These are our kids and our public servants. They are trying to normalize this as fast as possible and we have to figure out a way to stop it. We have a unique opportunity in history to eradicate this plague through staying on message.

             The actual topic that certain elite individuals are trying to keep under wraps by muddying the waters around this investigation, in order to make it appear impossible and crazy, is that of pedophilia in positions of authority, and the facilitation of these habits through government programs and institutions, such as CPS and its abuse of Federal power, or Alert Sense, a company that puts out Amber Alerts yet hired Laura Gayler as its VP of marketing despite her being arrested for child trafficking in Haiti, Hillary Clinton helped to get her released.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             For this topic there are mountains of historical and anecdotal evidence, and outright proof of those who became too high-profile to keep from being exposed, such as Dennis Hastert or Jimmy Savile. Sadly, even Mr. Saville was not ever charged due to such high connections with British royalty, but his abusive taste for young boys was widely known amongst government and royalty alike, yet was allowed to continue.

            <p>
             The truly disheartening level to which these government institutions have been infiltrated is staggering, and can be seen throughout history, anytime an individual within a certain top percentile inadvertently calls attention to the wrong topic, a shadowy yet sophisticated, fast-moving, well-oiled, governmental body that is the embodiment of efficiency flies into action to stifle, control and obfuscate. Showing us just how efficient government should be, or can be, when it is serving its own interests.
