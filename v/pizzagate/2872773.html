I have no personal problem with this guy getting waterboarded à la CIA until he gives up his contacts.

              Absolutely. But they've seen much without understanding. They are right in the belly of the beast. You can talk to them and see the outline of a picture. Context is everything. I often wonder why people use names like "yogsoggoth". It's like carrying a battle standard. If you knew who's banner you were carrying you'd drop it and light it on fire. Or you'd hoist it even higher. Depends on what kind of person you are, I guess. And who calibrated your moral compass. Some people are 180 degrees off.

               My Morals are on track. Yog has been described as a cosmic mist at times, and a man behind a shimmering curtain among others. Lovecraft had knowledge of the dark underlying forces in society at the time, and used his mythos to convey this message, much like HG Wells. The Morlocks were the Molech worshipers, and the Eloi were the normal humans. Promoted as science fiction or fantasy, they were actually descriptive allegories in many ways.

                The time machine has always stuck in my head. As well as other pieces of "fiction". I think people have dropped breadcrumbs in our culture throughout history. But jeeze. Are we all do stupid as to not understand? I know I am.

                 You have to think about that in several ways at once. % of people that are literate to begin with. % of people who read, even if they can, and/or, have comprehensive skills. % chart of those people that are competent at History. I could probably go on, but somehow I don't think that would change anything. If you ever see an old black and white Time Machine movie, will you view it differently than the first time you watched it? You are not stupid at all. You might have been denied pertinent information though. On a side note, the creator of Godzilla and companions Tomoyuki Tanaka, most rikery stole the entire cast from Lovecraft, with some Japanese changes. Gotta have the Turtle that created the Earth, Gamera.
