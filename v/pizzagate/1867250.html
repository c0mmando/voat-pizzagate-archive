<p>I\'ve actually read William Tompkins book.

            Been following victoryofthelight with great interest.
           </p>
           <p>
            Personally, I don't see how it functions as a psy-op. There really is no nefarious undercurrent to any of the information. I think what people have a hard time grasping is that the religions are all in fact a creation of the same agenda. They just each had a different function for the people they're targeting, and that agenda is largely the divide and conquer method. That should be perfectly obvious, and necessitates the acceptance of the fact that most of these religions actually should be ditched. Studied, but ditched. They are all a manipulation of the principles explained in The Law of One, or what Corey Goode claims is the Blue Avians' message.
           </p>
           <p>
            Goode has claimed for some time that an alliance with the SSP is working behind the scenes to take down the Cabal. He has accurately predicted the announcement/appearance of numerous technologies tied up with the process of disclosure. Victoryofthelight is perfectly in line with his testimony. He said late last year, when he claimed the covert war for disclosure began, to prepare for a series of disclosures, of leaks. Victoryofthelight, I suspect, is part of the alliance fighting behind the scenes.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you do the research, everything is matching up. I guess it could be a psy-op...but I really don't feel it. There's plenty of things happening at the moment to suggest otherwise. The massive
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/68i54i/it_is_time_you_know_the_truth/">
             Reddit post
            </a>
            victoryofthelight made speaks volumes. It brought together a great deal of information that I've encountered in my research over the years, and did so with such cohesion... I'm really convinced whoever is behind the account knows what's going on. It made so much sense of so much chaos that I'd find it more incredible for the victoryofthelight disclosures not to be true. And again - I just can't wrap my head around a nefarious agenda to it. They're arguing for all the things humanity needs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Plus, a lot of their posts have actually been getting removed - the ones with hardcore revelations on specific things. Most of their 9/11 posts disappeared within minutes. The elite are shitting themselves about this account. Why would they be, if they were behind it?

             I'm happy to see someone else who knows about the Law of One. It is most definitely one of the more complicated and rewarding things I've read.
            </p>
            <p>
             I agree about religions too. All of them have misinformation or were meant for people of a different time. Additionally, most of the works we read such as the bible have been mistranslated, adjusted, or just plain edited to fit a narrative. There are so many great books banned from the Bible that are worth a deep dive.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most religions/philosophies point to universal truths in one way or another though and that's what resonated with me regarding the Law of One. It shined a light on the true message behind so many veiled truths or half truths.
            </p>
            <p>
             To all the folks here warning us to be cautious during disclosure events, Corey said the same thing. His warning was essentially that while amother being may offer technology or a path or a way that looks fantastic, please be very skeptical. If anyone is selling anything don't buy it. Nobody is going to save us. We have to make our own choice to pull ourselves out of the darkness we all see around us now.

            This is a cult called the Diamond Path. It is. very dangerous. They are chanelling demons. YOu can find their videos on youtube but do not watch them unless you have very strong protection from the Lord. They can be traced back to Michael Aquino.

            Yeah I started following them on Twitter. She lost me when today one of her links calls Jesus, Lucifer. Their links deny Christ and  blaspheme God .. play at your own risk.  Anyone who knows scripture knows that a house divided cannot stand. If you have ever had to fight demonic forces ( I have) I can tell you that at the name of Jesus- they flee and are defeated. At the invoking  of the blood of Jesus.. they slither away and their target is untouchable.
Don't have any weapons? No problem. Scripture is the weapon of choice in the heavenlies.. because:
           </p>
           <p>
            Phillipians 2 9-11
**Therefore God exalted him to the highest place
    and gave him the name that is above every name,
10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
    in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
11 to declare Jesus Christ Lord ,
    to the glory of God the Father.
**
           </p>
           <p>
            Ezekiel 28 clearly speaks about Lucifer and what drove him from the mount of God.
I have spoken, declares the Sovereign Lord.’”
           </p>
           <p>
            11 The word of the Lord came to me: 12 “Son of man, take up a lament concerning the king of Tyre and say to him: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says:
           </p>
           <p>
            “‘You were the seal of perfection,
    full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
13 You were in Eden,
    the garden of God;
every precious stone adorned you:
    carnelian, chrysolite and emerald,
    topaz, onyx and jasper,
    lapis lazuli, turquoise and beryl.[b]
Your settings and mountings[c] were made of gold;
    on the day you were created they were prepared.
14 You were anointed as a guardian cherub,
    for so I ordained you.
You were on the holy mount of God;
    you walked among the fiery stones.
15 You were blameless in your ways
    from the day you were created
    till wickedness was found in you.
16 Through your widespread trade
    you were filled with violence,
    and you sinned.
So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God,
    and I expelled you, guardian cherub,
    from among the fiery stones.
17 Your heart became proud
    on account of your beauty,
and you corrupted your wisdom
    because of your splendor.
So I threw you to the earth;
    I made a spectacle of you before kings.
18 By your many sins and dishonest trade
    you have desecrated your sanctuaries.
So I made a fire come out from you,
    and it consumed you,
and I reduced you to ashes on the ground
    in the sight of all who were watching.
19 All the nations who knew you
    are appalled at you;
you have come to a horrible end
    and will be no more.’”
           </p>
           <p>
            Be careful folks. Pray for discernment... those without the seal of the Holy Spirit are in trouble.

            One of the comments: " I think a lot more people have been what we would call waking up lately: questioning TPTB and their motives for faking all kinds of stuff with their space programs and wars, and lying to us about pretty much everything, and an alien psyop might sway public opinion how they want it to go. Maybe it's just me, but the "disclosure is coming" stuff seems to be ramping up. We should continue to distrust them and question absolutely everything, no matter what they say about aliens or stargates."I agree on this, for we need to keep our minds and ears open.  BTW,  What is Operation Bluebeam?

            I'm thinking that this might be a PSYOP to redirect us all away from PedoGate and specifically the corruption of the Obama Administration with ObamaGate.  The reason I think this is because Obama himself was the first to follow this account.  It was set up many years ago but not used, a "sleeping" account that may one day come into use. I believe this account could be the workings of the DEEP STATE.  Look into Werner Von Braun and his involvement with Project PaperClip and being a Nazi scientist who came over after WW2 and established NASA and other DEEP STATE organizations...which were really infiltrations...he warned Dr. Carol Rosin on his death bed, she being his close assistant, "remember, Carol, the last card is the Alien invasion card..."....I am paraphrasing here, but the gist of the message was that if ever the DEEP STATE looses control and we find out what is really going on with the CIA invasion/infiltration of their EVIL AGENDA, they will pull out the ET/Alien Invasion card to try to control the minds of the people....I'm not saying there are not other beings out there and I know there is a deep space program...I'm just saying I am wary of the timing of these tweets and their true intention...they are posting NOTHING that I have not known before having worked deeply in this field decades ago.

             Yes, very possible. Our own internal compass will become very very valuable in the coming years. I think this is solid advice. Several people out there are warning about this that the ETs will be sold as benevolent because they can provide helpful technology. I have never seen an ET, but I have to believe they are like people. Good and Bad and all are suspect until their actions over an extended period of time prove otherwise.

            BEWARE! This is all very clearly a part of the great deception foretold in the Bible. NWO attempting to join all major religions, convince humanity that aliens are benevolent and here to help or guide mankind to enlightenment. Don't be fooled! We were warned of lying signs and wonders...Satan is the great deceiver, and refers to himself as the bearer of light. So-called aliens are merely demons--ALL of them. There are no "friendly" aliens planning to bail out the human race. God told us that many would be persuaded...even many of the elect. DO NOT FALL INTO THE TRAP! Blessings brothers and sisters...

            Be wary of anything with David Wilcock. First started hearing him about 15yrs ago on cost to coast. Dude is a total fraud looking to make money. There's always some major event just around the corner that he's pushing. Oh yeah, and he believes he is the reincarnation of Edgar Cayce (as well as his current friends are reincarnation of Edgar Cayces friend group)....im into this stuff but I wouldn't hitch our wagon to anything David Wilcock related.

             This is such a misconception. How exactly do you think Wilcock is making heaps of money? It's certainly not off his books. The income off of being a published author these days is not too far, once you spread it out and take costs into account, from minimum wage. 
Wilcock is not a rich man at all.
            </p>
            <p>
             And you really should check out Corey Goode. He has his detractors, but most of them seem to have sour grapes. Goode is probably the most refreshing whistle blower testimony to come out in years. Taken alongside Tompkins, it's amazing how much their testimonies corroborate with each other. They pretty much tie up so many loose ends that have existed in ufology for decades, something which most others working in the field have been unable to do. Compare the Goode and Tompkins information with The Law Of One material and it becomes even more compelling.
            </p>
            <p>
             As always I think it's about looking at all of the info available. The truth lies in the middle.

             Fair enough about Wilcock. Who knows if he's legit or not. I'm just pointing out that the show he hosts with Goode covers the same stuff. The source is actually Corey Goode. Does anyone know anything about him?

            Been following this acct for a week. Pretty bizarre stuff, Wikileaks emails to prove what that person is talking about. Strange thing is, when I came across some of those Wikileaks emails around 3 months ago, (most are from older emails like Kissinger files) I could not understand fully what was going on. Also, the Podesta files, Space Treaty was WILD.
           </p>
           <p>
            He/she just called out Podesta feeding children to the Dracos!?!?

             Yes, the old files. A lot of the content is missing, but there is proof that our government has been discussing the strategy for how to disclose this stuff for decades.

              What worries me, I don't trust our Gov to disclose it properly. They will distort it and feed false info

               Exactly. Their excuse is that the people cannot take it and it will cause hysteria. Yes, of course it will. Its like learning for the first time your parents had sex at some point. Eww.... But it is time. Rip off the band aid!

                I never did get that stuff about kids getting grossed out about their parents having sex.  I thought it was cute that my Grandpa remarried and was happy when I caught them passionately hugging.  Yes, I knew they were having sex and I was happy for them. This must have been something new.  My friend says here kids got grossed out when she made a funny comment about her and her husband.  Yikes Group Up kids you are not they only ones that want to have that gratification.  Just some more red pilling.   Tee hee. I think you are right, the public will Go Ape.

                 Another matter of perspective thing depending on who your parents are. For me it was a shattering moment and I wanted to go back to the stork narrative for a while.

                  Yeah, I can see that.  My parents were very prim about that kind of stuff so maybe I wanted to be the opposite. My dad always called me the black sheep of the family, the odd one.  Because I questioned and would not follow along.  Guess that's why I am on here.

             Understood. Do what you will with all of it. I'm not trying to convince anyone of any of this. I've been doing my own digging for many years as have most of you here. Nothing there is easily believable. Although, 6 months ago many of you may not have been convinced that the world is run by Luciferians that are abusing our children, but here we are.
            </p>
            <p>
             I do find it funny though that the theories are seen as "fantastic" and might taint the pizzagate investigation. Similarly, some people on 4chan /pol/ think pizzagate is a fake hot mess that shouldn't be associated with the good work they are doing to prove their Seth Rich murder theories. It is all a matter of perspective I guess. Godspeed to any and all of you looking for truth regardless of where you find it.
