            SGT says that 'police in Suffolk' have confirmed that Clement Freud was out of the country and his Portugal home had been loaned to the Podesta bros. So I guess one would need to question the police in Suffolk about this. I've always found those witness-generated drawings to be suspicious and wonder if they weren't planted by someone who wants to connect Freud/British pedo rings to DNC pedos. Wonder when they first appeared in the press with what story. The only way I could see the bros skulking about Portugal like this is if there really is something to Madeleine's eye deformity making her special to ritualists. In that case we would suspect that she was brought to the environs of Freud's villa by plan. Wonder why her parents were vacationing there?

            The answer is NO ONE KNOWS. And without a subpoena, a summons, and unsealed depositions from Podestas, or else another email hack, we will never know. Because their personal travel plans are not public knowledge.

            There is no direct proof. J. Podesta was at an event in DC the day before. However numerous other sources (magazine articles) talk about how they jet around and will hit multiple European cities in a weekend to buy art and be back in the office on Monday, so it is entirely feasible. Furthermore, they have not denied this allegation or offered any other alibi.  So, evidence is only circumstantial but it is compelling and not refuted.

            Edit: also check on the pizzagate wiki, rebel skum is documenting the facts and refuting the non facts.
