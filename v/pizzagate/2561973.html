            This looks like Burgess has a very lucrative business.  Well  thought of and well known, the whole family.  Lyle left and Danny, the son took over.  More than likely a respected pillar of the community.  Until now.

            Yes, this letter is crazy. So in short the DA says the Sheriff stripped, sold and then purchased evidence guns at “substantial discounts”, and even personally obtained an evidence gun himself, and although this should not happen, it is not really illegal, just kinda sorta wrong and should not continue. To make matters even more interesting, Sheriff Steve Moore told numerous media outlets including the Record (before the DA love letter came out) that his office “never sold evidence guns to the best of my knowledge”. Huh????
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              How much were the ‘substantial discounts’ Moore and others received on evidence guns?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Why doesn’t the Sheriff know about an Uzi, serial MC01240, that was sold against court order on 7/11/12 for $750 that was once owned by Danny Ray Morrison, whose investigation led to the death of Deputy Dighton Little? (The DA, the Record and 209 Times has all the documents to prove this.)
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            In what bizarre universe is public embezzlement legal?

            $10M .  I made the figure outrageous so it has to go to court.  I want to go to court.  Frank Gayalo claims Sheriff Steve Moore has been threatening him through a third party.  He is accusing him of embezzlement and a countywide corruption probe.
           </p>
           <p>
            Death Threats Include, Torture Is Worse Than Death and Vengeance is a Dish Best Served Cold.  Oh and by the way Sheriff Moore also just happens to be the County Coroner.    Pretty tricky being the County Coroner too.

            I announced that I was going to take a break from Pizzagate for awhile but I feel compelled to comment here. Please do not think that I am defending this perp but I just had to dig further when I saw that the charge was statutory rape instead of the felony of forcible rape. Statutory rape is a crime by virtue of the ages of the perp and victim,  not force or coersion and it requires intercourse. And typically there is a separate criminal code for sexual abuse of children whether by intercourse or other impermissable conduct. So the charges seemed weird but then again we know California is weird.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could not find any news reports on my cell phone that went back to the time of arrest where some more details might be available; I only found dozens of reports on the sentence and was able to glean a little background information.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. Burgess was a family friend for over 20 years and had invited the family to his cabin for a mini-vacation. During the visit the mother  observed several  "incidents"  between Burgess and the child. No details of  the " incidents" were provided. Why would there be several?  Wasn't the first incident enough to get as far away from Mr. Burgess as possible or was the conduct just suspicious.  The prosecutor said there was no penetration involved  and this was a plea bargain which the parents had earlier found acceptable . Intercourse was a requirement for statutory rape but was defined as any penetration  no matter how slight and ejaculation need not occur. The statute could be applied as a misdemeanor or felony and punishment could be as little as probation or a prison term. One unusual provision of California's  statutory rape law is that it provides for civil damages without having to resort to a full fledged personal injury trial.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. Burgess had the financial ability to defend himself    in court which might have required the child to testify.   The trauma of a jury trial can be as bad as the trauma of the assault itself placing a parent and the prosecutor in the terrible position of letting a defendant off easy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's assume that the "incidents" consisted of rubbing up against the child's private area with no real penetration or even an exposed  penis. Sort of like what Joe Biden does to little girls breasts, sly as a fox.   This  plea agreement  acknowledges the commission of a  sexual offense inspite of any ambiguities,  imposes probationary control over the perp,  provided closure for the family at least as to the misery of court proceedings,  and enables money damages with which to pay for counseling.
           </p>
           <p>
            The law is not perfect. Until we have camera lenses trained on all of us 24/7, with audio,  we are not going to have the full justice all children deserve. Sometimes we will be forced to settle for less.

             For anyone interested in how difficult it is to get very young children to testify under cross examination, I highly recommend Ross Cheit's THE WITCH HUNT NARRATIVE.  Very well written book.

             Don't know how much of it is spin, but according to this report, the filthy creep's attorney charcterized what he is charged with as "inappropriate touching" and that "the charge is based on a claim by the girl's mother that she saw Burgess stick his hand down her daughter's pants."

              thanks for the additional info, i missed that one, looks like  it came out after my comment.. Anyway it kind of proves my point that it was an ambiguous offense. To  be charged with the crime of intercourse  when it was fondling with a hand  is a kind of punishment especially when it is splashed all over the country. The mother may not have had a good enough view of this man's conduct and he probably said, oh I was just  helping her getting her get her panties on straight after she used the toilet .  Whats a prosecutor  supposed to do.
             </p>
             <p>
              I was equally perplexed by the statement of the father that the child was so upset she slept on the floor outside the door. If she was  that distressed why wasn't she sleeping with them or next to them in a makeshift bed for awhile.  He also said  she would need counseling for life and this made me wonder if the parents reactions in her presence made things worse. I loved those Hampstead kids. I found them totally believable yet emotionally intact.
             </p>
             <p>
              I really don't see corruption here so much as I see fuzziness of events enough to make a jury conviction unpredictable.

               I had the same thought about her sleeping on the floor outside the room and am still stuck on how there could have been "several" events witnessed by the mother.  I mean how many times would an average mother accept the "I was just adjusting her panties" ruse?
              </p>
              <p>
               As usual, it's difficult to draw conclusions with so little information, but I too think there probably was not enough clarity to take this to trial.

             conceal the theory of its construction. It should be a restless, uncertain, frightful collection of details giving the effect of a nightmare about to explode.
            </p>

             An influential article by Burgess, "The Wild Men of Paris", was the first introduction of cubist art in the United States. The article was drawn from interviews with Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and Georges Braque.[3]
            </p>
            <p>
             His books The Maxims of Methuselah and The Maxims of Noah were illustrated by Louis D. Fancher.
            </p>
            <p>
             Burgess founded the San Francisco Boys' Club Association, now the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of San Francisco, in 1891. The Club was the first of its kind west of the Mississippi River. You mean the obvious connection to the modern art world and money laundering, or the connection to Monsanto. Burgess family gets around, and in the farmer to seed crowd they get a 2.5 out of 5. I hope that no one still believes that Picasso cut part of his own ear off. The Rothchild's were against the modern art movement until they figured out the scam.

              But it's not the only reason judges look the other way, in the UK almost every single government employee looked the other way when they faced child-grooming gangs.

            To be fair, the worst thing you can do at sentencing is say you did nothing wrong. A judge is looking to see if you acknowledge guilt or culpability for your actions to determine if you can be rehabilitated or will re-offend.
