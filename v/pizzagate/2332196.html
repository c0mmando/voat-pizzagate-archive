<p>The CDAN article says Judith\'s experiences with pedowood began when she was seven. Given the above link, this means our search for pedowood suspects regarding the abuse of Judith Barsi would be ANY film she was on from 1985-1988.</p>
<p>In short, we\'re looking for any actor, producer, or director that worked with Judith Barsi during this time. We need to find the commonalities between the works.</p>

<p>This link believes the fire was due to a satanic ritual sacrifice. Spelburg is suspected to be involved in her sexual abuse.</p>

<p>I think this is either a crime scene or autopsy photo. Gun powder residue is indicative of being shot in the head, so this is an entry wound.</p>
<p>However, this photo reveals an inconsistency with the official narrative. The official narrative says her body was doused with gasoline, then directly set on fire. If that\'s the case, then there would be evidence of second and third degree burns on the body.</p>
<p>Supposedly (I\'d have to find source), there are accounts saying an explosion was heard. Gasoline doesn\'t explode when ignited through a simple match, it ignites. I believe that explosion may be the true start of the fire. By a third party.</p>

<p>If this is true, then Judith thoroughly enjoyed her experiences in her animated roles, meaning she may have not been a victim during those times. Possible to take Don Bluth off the list of suspects.</p>

            Since this is the most likely movie reported in the CDAN link, the list of suspects is most likely the male actors.
           </p>
           <p>
            Speilburg isn't listed in the list of producers, but I do suspect his involvement since Jaws was one of his creations.

            Hmm, I'm going to question the validity of that autopsy photo, wouldn't it make more sense to doubt the dodgy, recent picture over the official story itself?
            <em>
             (Not the case for JFK, to be fair)
            </em>
            At least, this was my first reaction when reading your post, as the image looked softly manipulated. Since then, I traced it back a bit...

             http://www.findadeath.com/Deceased/b/Judith%20Barsi%20story/judith_barsi.htm
            </a>
            -
- The original findadeath source, though they have since taken it off their article, they still
            <a href="http://www.findadeath.com/Deceased/b/Judith%20Barsi%20story/barsiheadwound.jpg">
             host the photo
            </a>
            and it is the only version of that image I have been able to find.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you don't mind, I'd like to link three other, in-depth articles about her death and subsequent police files, including photos of their house during listing and Judith's body being removed from the scene:

            Unfortunately, Enty's story doesn't confirm that it is the same producer, and the Jessie TV show doesn't have any easily verifiable producers by name, just production companies (although the lead star had a hand in it). Judith was in Episode #8, but some sources say that's #9. After looking at original VHS recordings of credits for Jessie, I finally narrowed it down to a

            Dangit, I remember reading on someone with a lot of Hanna Montana credits, but forgot who. Eerghh, this is still all too much of a reach. Enty said she was 9 when a lot of abuse occurred at once, but that's anywhere between 86 and 87, since movie productions can take a lot of time before release. She simply worked on too many projects to narrow it down. I don't know enough about CD&amp;N to be useful, as I won't be able to recall old gossip of producers in the past. Will have to leave this to someone else, but I do think it's best to focus on when she was 7 years old. Excluding all the commercials, that only leaves two or so movies/shows she was on to research.

            Ok, trying to break it down into bite size pieces....according to cdan, the first was a tv show and she was led away by a PRODUCER. I'm assuming it's the abuser. Cdan says fast forward a couple years, this time it's a movie, and again she's led away by a producer. This narrows the first search for.me anyway

              Also, as someone on here said, movies sometimes take awhile to make. So maybe close attention on when movies were cast or production was started! Cdan clearly implicates producers!

             Something's not right with the offical narrative, and that autopsy photo is at the center of why.
            </p>
            <p>
             The lack of 2nd and 3rd degree burns, which would have been certain if any bit of that fire touched those bodies due to the gasoline that was supposed to been dumped on them.
            </p>
            <p>
             The metal den article claims it wasn't the father that set that fire.
            </p>
            <p>
             My theory is that the father (ALSO a scumbag) was killed, then the house was set ablaze.
            </p>
            <p>
             There was an explosion. What would have caused that explosion?

             <p>
              Says Father doused them gasoline, lit them on fire, and went to garage to kill himself

              They didn't release Mother or Judiths name pending relative notification

             <p>
              So he had no relatives, so who were hers?

               My theory as to whay happened (crime scene construction).
              </p>
              <p>
               Judith was indeed killed by her father via gunshot to the head. (CDAN article says this is true and the autopsy photo shows gunshot residue near her ear, meaning this was done at close range) -&gt; her mother was killed by the same culprit (also on CDAN) -&gt; the father was killed by a different assailant in the garage (murder designed to look like a suicide, which is easy assuming an execution style murder) -&gt; house was set on fire by the other assailant as part of ritualistic sacrifice.
              </p>
              <p>
               However, the fire department acted quickly, preventing Judith from being immolated, which would explain the lack of second and third degree burns on her body. The gasoline is a lie as per the "official narrative".

                 Powder burns indicative of close range weapon and if fire was extinguished prior to total body consumption there wouldn’t necessarily be signs of soot/fire damage apparent in the head shot (photo).  Fire doesn’t consume bodies as fast as you’d think.

                   Without being able to see others it’s difficult to categorically say but on that photo it looks like others I’ve seen before and the powder burn looks legit. You’re right, we have no way of knowing whether or not this is the actual photo of that particular deceased and it’s hardly identifying.  I can say though that I’ve seen fire damage to lower limbs and extremities - even with incendiary being involved, where the upper body has remained completely intact   So it is a possible in this case.  A sad affair all round nonetheless

            Found something truly heartbreaking. Seeme Don Bluth was deeply heartbroken over her death. The protagonist's design and personality were based off of her. I'm starting to suspect this may have been a cause of Don Bluth's decline via depression/despair.

             I found the director for that episode. A suspect from another CDAN.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'd suggest calling some people into this thread. I need back up. Namely looking into common actors, producers, and directors of works she was involved in from the complete list (starting from the most likely starting year she became a pedowood victim) I provided. The name of that actress who quit out of disgust too, for I want to arrange an interview to get more information.
