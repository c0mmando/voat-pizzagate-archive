            I've seen it done. It takes resolve but it is possible. The video I saw a Japanese guy stormed the store where his wife worked. Got around the counter and diced her up. Then turned the blade on himself. He stabbed himself in the chest 6 or 7 times with full force. An incredible sight.

The Case For Conspiracy EXPOSED!          Point being, I make my point to be heard, and may ridicule someone else's point of view for a short period, but this is different in that I have been followed.   We are here to piece together truth about missing kids. Sure this guy was an expert at killing himself, had PTSD from helping others and making good money, was also known to be extremely accident prone. He was supposedly in Haiti while the child stealing operation was going down and that is all the proof any sane person needs right now, even if this is fed fake news.

            Try to find this story in the news and you'll discover that Google search predictive spelling function is turned off. Then you'll find that most media are burying the story by simply ignoring it, and the few who even give it a mention devote their coverage to trashing his legacy as a celebrity doctor and famous surgeon.
Not to belabor the obvious or anything, but it should be noted that merely CHOOSING to ignore/target/smear(etc) someone is pretty conclusive proof that the whole thing is very high on the priority list of the folks doing the ignoring/targeting/smearing.

            First of all, a surgeon would know of a much less painful way to kill himself. He wouldn't miss his heart. He wouldn't choose a horrific bloody suicide knowing his daughter could find him. No way it was a suicide.

             Doctors: Haiti medical situation shameful
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Within 24 hours of the earthquake, Dr. David Helfet put together a 13-member team of surgeons, anesthesiologists and operating room nurses, with a massive amount of orthopedic operating room equipment, ready to be flown directly to Port-au-Prince on a private plane.
            </p>
            <p>
             We thought our plan was a good one, but we soon learned we were incredibly naive. Disaster management in Haiti was nonexistent.
            </p>
            <p>
             The difficulties in getting in -- despite the intelligence we had from people on the ground and Dr. Helfet's connections with Partners in Health and Bill and Hillary Clinton -- only hinted at the difficulties we would have once we arrived.
            </p>
            <p>
             We started out Friday morning and got a slot to get into Port-au-Prince on Friday. That was canceled when we were on the runway and was rescheduled for the next day. We were diverted to the Dominican Republic and planned on arriving in Port-au-Prince on Saturday.
            </p>
            <p>
             That Saturday morning slot also was canceled and postponed until the afternoon. The airport had one runway and hundreds of planes trying to land. But nobody was prioritizing the flights.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once we finally landed, we were taken to the General Hospital in Port-au-Prince with our medical supplies. We had been told that this hospital was up and running with two functioning operating rooms.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once we arrived, we saw a severely damaged hospital with no running water and only limited electrical power, supplied by a generator. Surgeries were being performed in the equivalent of a large storage closet, where amputations were performed with hacksaws.
            </p>
            <p>
             This facility could not nearly accommodate our equipment nor our expertise to treat the volume of injuries we saw.
            </p>
            <p>
             We quickly took our second option: Community Hospital of Haiti, about two miles away. There, we found about 750 patients lying on the floor. But the facility had running water, electricity and two functional operating rooms.
We found scores of patients with pus dripping out of open extremity fractures and crush injuries. Some wounds were already ridden with maggots.
            </p>
            <p>
             About a third of these victims were children. The entire hospital smelled of infected, rotting limbs and death. Later on, we would judge our surgical progress by the diminishment of the stench.
            </p>
            <p>
             In our naïveté, we didn't expect that the two anesthesia machines would not work; that there would be only one cautery available in the entire hospital to stop bleeding; that an operating room sterilizer fit only instruments the size of a cigar box; that there would be no sterile saline, no functioning fluoroscopy machine, no blood for transfusions, no ability to do lab work; and the only local staff was a ragtag group of voluntary health providers who, like us, had made it there on their own.
            </p>
            <p>
             As we got up and running and organized the patients for surgery, we told our contacts in the United States what we needed. More supplies were loaded for a second trip. Those included a battery-operated pulse lavage, a huge supply of sterile saline and the soft goods we needed desperately in the operating room.
            </p>
            <p>
             The plane landed as planned Sunday night, and the new equipment was loaded onto a truck. Then that truck, loaded with life-saving equipment, was hijacked somewhere between the airport and the hospital.
            </p>
            <p>
             We worked for 60-plus hours without stopping. The plane that would take us home would bring with it not only a new medical staff, but also equipment that was nonexistent in the hospital, or even the country.
            </p>
            <p>
             On Tuesday morning, a huge number of new patients arrived. The Haitians had heard we were trying to save limbs, and families were bringing their injured loved ones to us.
            </p>
            <p>
             The hospital was forced to lock down, closing its gates to the angry and frustrated crowd outside. On Tuesday morning, we saw that many of the patients we had operated on were becoming septic and would require additional surgeries.
            </p>
            <p>
             We decided the situation was untenable. Our supplies were running out, our team was past exhaustion, safety was rapidly becoming a concern, and we had no firm plan to leave or resupply.
            </p>
            <p>
             A hospital benefactor helped us get to the airport. First, Jamaican soldiers with M-16s escorted us out of the building as the crowd outside saw us abandoning the hospital.
            </p>
            <p>
             The fact that the military could not or would not protect the critical resupply medical equipment on Sunday, or allow the Tuesday flight to come in, is devastating and merits intense investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             There was no security at the hospital. We needed a much higher level of security with strong and clear support of the military from the very beginning.
The lack of support for our operation by the United States is shocking and embarrassing and shows how woefully unprepared we are for the realities of disasters. We came to understand that our isolated operation may work in a mission, but not in a disaster.
            </p>
            <p>
             Surgeons who expect to show up and operate will be mistaken. Without a complement of support staff and supplies, they are of limited to no value.
We left feeling as if we abandoned these patients, the country and its people, and we feel terrible.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our role back in New York is to expose the inadequacies of the system in the hopes of effecting change immediately.

             You're making an argument from incredulity.  This is a type of fallacy.  It's
             <em>
              I don't think it would happen this way, therefore no way did it happen this way.

             It's not very useful when something odd happens.

             If it wasn't suicide, do you think his daughter killed him?  Because

              An acclaimed trauma surgeon was found dead, with a knife in his chest, by his 11-year-old daughter Sunday in his Park Ave. apartment, police said.
             </p>
             <p>
              Investigators were treating the death of Dr. Dean Lorich as an apparent suicide, sources said.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             It leaves us with these possibilities
            </p>
            <p>
             A.  He killed himself.
            </p>
            <p>
             B.  His 11 year old daughter killed him and told the cops he committed suicide
            </p>
            <p>
             C.  Someone got into his apartment and killed him without his daughter hearing anything, no scuffle or screaming or anything.
            </p>
            <p>
             So while A might seem unlikely.  B and C also seem unlikely.     Any possibilities I missed?
            </p>
            <p>
             To me A seems the least unlikely, I know someone who killed themselves on the spur of the moment during an argument.

              The interesting thing about homicide investigation forensics is that the "likelihood" of  events is more or less irrelevant in comparison to the physical evidence thereof. Suicide is a specialized category of homicide. Let's see some evidence from that investigation (or lack thereof) before jumping off of any conclusions.

              I think you need to chill. You took my opinion and went into tweaker mode.

              Do I think his daughter did it? No. I think he was suicided. Are you going to believe the details about who was there? Do you not know how this works or what? So if he was alone in the apartment with his daughter, what do you think? He argued with her and stabbed himself on the spot? Do you think someone who's been a surgeon for years is going to stab himself and miss his heart?
             </p>
             <p>
              You need to lay off the meth. Have you been awake for too many days? Get some sleep. When you wake up, go search online for "Clinton body count". Maybe that will help you get a grip on reality.

               What you are calling meth is actually logic.   I know it feels toxic to you, but's it's just an ordinary application of logic.  We have three unlikely scenarios, but two of them are highly unlikely.   You are choosing the most unlikely of the three based on what?   Because you are clear-headed?  Or because you laboring under the delusion of a nonsensical conspiracy theory and you feel it applies here.
              </p>
              <p>
               And they reason people supposedly wanted this guy dead?   Because the guy wrote a critical article in 2010?  Seriously?  That's the reason?
              </p>
              <p>
               You are not only picking the least likely example, you are doing so by ignoring evidence to the contrary.   So the daughter and the cops are lying?  Is that your next claim?

                You are over analyzing my comment, which is only my opinion. I don't get why you are wasting your time doing that. I have a headache. I don't feel the need to argue, debate or reason with you. I'm not trying to convince you. It's no sweat off my back what you believe stranger. So go waste your time debating with people that have something to prove.
