            Well first off if you haven't already looked or heard about  the Pickton Farm or Piggy's Palace, then check it out. They had parties there, with politicians sometime attending. Many women were killed but here's the strange stuff. Years ago I heard about a woman(through a family member) who swears they made snuff films there. She had been there and witnessed something terrible. Then lately, the last couple years others have confirmed the same story more or less. Clinton's pal Giustra is from Vancouver. Oh yes, I may add they blamed it all on a semi illiterate man ( slow as they say) named Willie Pickton.

             Eeek! I wish I had time to check that out. Thanks for the summary!

             On my next free day, that will be my topic of research. I can see how such a place would be the perfect backdrop for a snuff film. It's especially troublesome in consideration of the push for legislation to crack down on filming agriculture. I know that I'm going into the realm of crazy talk; but I have a tendency towards intuition and there have been a few times where I was passed by enclosed horse trailers on the highway and thought "What if that's a human trafficking vehicle, and full of victims right now?". It turns my stomach to realize just how plausible that could be.
