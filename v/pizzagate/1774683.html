            Thanks to George Webb for making this subject even more real as there is so much about MKULTRA and the horrific programs we know something about and maybe a thousand more we know nothing about.

             Yeah, I have to agree with this. I believe his info is true, but I believe it's a limited hangout for someone, not sure who. Obama? Ive even considered Russia since he references RT alot. His info is good so I glean what I can and consider the source.

              Yeah, he's too slick and fearless for my liking. I remember seeing a comment in his youtube where someone says something like "Aren't you afraid that the CIA will catch up to you" and he replied something like "Bring it, I love chatting with the CIA", like he could play the CIA or some shit.

               this is how you know when someone is a real truth teller. If they say they're taking on the big players, but walking around fearless, or broadcasting daily from a shiny studio, they're probably a limited hangout.

                Or have balls of steel and don't give a shit? I do tend to think Webb is a limited hangout too, but your argument would make Seaman a reall truth teller...after all he is constantly pissing his pants in fear...but not sure he's any more a truth teller than Webb

                 Oh we could debate that one. I've been following Seaman since 2011. He's the real deal. Not a hero, not flawless, but he is one of us. There are flaws, but we only hear about them because there has been a very serious campaign launched against him, so he gets bashed more than anyone. But he's never told an untruth, he's never misreported on pizzagate or anything else. He's been very helpful and not harmful to pizzagate, and has never backtracked on it, to this day he calls Podesta and James pedos from his Twitter account, proving that claims about lawsuits are bogus - these guys don't want to see the inside of a courtroom. David has never claimed that anyone tweeting a certain hashtag will one day get a million dollars, like George Webb has done. David never bashed Webb, yet Webb called David disinfo. Which is untrue. When Webb was asked for proof for that comment, he changed it to "I should have said distraction". Which is also untrue, it is Webb that is a distraction imo.

                  I've probably read more about the guy than watches Tbh....And he certainly got a bunch of people looking down these rabbit holes... i appreciate anyone who even addresses this topic....But he has had a few freakouts along the way....And I've never really learned anything i didn't know from him

                   I've followed him and played along for awhile. I'm 50/50 one what's up with him. I know for sure he's not being altogether upfront. I know his bro's backstory, which actually makes me think he's for real about this whole moral compass thing and that he might know something about what's going on in the hospitals. There's certainly production going on that centers around a low tech presentation yet is more than it seems. But so far it seemed to have the right effect in that he was getting a demo of people to look at corps and articles that wouldn't normally look that direction, which I think is no matter what good. But, again, not much censorship from google (other than if you're trying to comment; also had weird convo from a past follower recently about her being able to fix that for me and get my comments uncensored...You can fix that? How?); not much tie into Israel's involvement in syria; there's continuity errors that wouldn't be there if it weren't a production; he mentioned once recently that (cant remember to which profile) he was doing this to get back at the people that killed Roger Maxwell, which is weird considering he always went with the portland christmas tree bomber story before, and considering it makes it seem like he knew Maxwell or  knows Maxwell's daughter which means he might also know a certain billionaire with a plane and friends in high places; and now another follower is losing her shit saying that he is indeed working for epstein along with him have he's some sort of sexual deviant. The lady sounded pretty Molly about Jesus but still. Anyway, 2017 is weird.

                   Yup. I can think of another giant media personality about whom I would say the same, but I get trolled relentlessly if I say anything negative about him so
