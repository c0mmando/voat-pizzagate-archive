<blockquote>
<p>An eminent former Great Ormond Street cardiologist has been found guilty of inappropriate and sexually motivated conduct by a medical disciplinary tribunal.</p>
<p>Accused of caressing a boy and telling him it was \'normal behaviour\' in Europe</p>
<p>The tribunal decided that Philipp Bonhoeffer, who was dismissed from the famous hospital in May 2010, was guilty of a string of incidents which included caressing a young boy and writing a love letter to a teenager.</p>
<p>From 2003 to 2008 he was chairman of the medical board of the UK-based charity The Chain of Hope.</p>

            Regardless of one’s own perspective on Christianity, itself, Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a fraud, a jew puppet who posed as a Christian while advocating the jew perspective that Christ was a well-intentioned myth. It would be like professing to be vegan while wearing leather boots and enjoying veal cutlets.
