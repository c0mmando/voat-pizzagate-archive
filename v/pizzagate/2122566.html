The Times-Picayune</p>
<p>More than 70 Louisiana cases are listed among the &quot;perversion files&quot; -- a vast, long-secret collection of documents chronicling men cast out of the Boy Scouts of America over the past six decades because, in many cases, they were suspected of being child molesters. Nearly 20 of the cases have a connection to New Orleans -- a city particularly salient in the history of the Scouts as the site of the organization\'s first well-known sex-abuse scandal 36 years ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Troop 137, authorities learned, &quot;was the nucleus of a nationwide sex and pornography ring, with boys recruited into the troop sent to other states for the pleasure of the men there,&quot; according to a Times-Picayune report on the trials.  Seventeen adults were arrested, including the four New Orleans Scout leaders, a Tennessee minister who ran a home for wayward boys, an official from a Florida school for children with learning disabilities, a prominent New Orleans landscape painter and a Boston millionaire, Richard C. Jacobs.  <a href="http://archive.is/7hMWY">http://archive.is/7hMWY</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Troop leader Richard Halverson (51), a probation officer and foster father to two boys who were wards of the state, and assistant leaders Raymond (Tom) Woodall and Harry Cramer, used boys for sex and porn.  Richard C. Jacobs, a Boston millionaire, was indicted on 15 counts as a participant in these crimes. 
The men, along with Lewis Sialle, who was not named in the Scouts\' files, decided in 1974 to found a Boy Scout unit, Troop 137 in eastern New Orleans, in order to &quot;provide them with boys ... for their sexual pleasure,&quot; Sialle later testified.  <a href="http://archive.is/bweWj#selection-1121.0-1144.1">http://archive.is/bweWj#selection-1121.0-1144.1</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The confidential files, kept secret for decades in the Boy Scouts\' Texas headquarters, were compiled in a database released Thursday by the Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p>That newspaper\'s investigation found that, across the country, the Scouts sometimes &quot;failed to report abuse to authorities and many times apparently covered up allegations to protect the organization\'s reputation.&quot; The Scouts issued an apology Thursday for past actions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>June 20, 1985 NYT: Altar boys and members of the parish Boy Scout troop were among those molested by the Rev. Gilbert Gauthe, 40 years old, according to felony charges of sexual abuse lodged against him by the local authorities. </p>
<p>He Was a Boy Scout Chaplain </p>
<p>The Rt. Rev. Gerard Frey, Bishop of the Lafayette Diocese, acknowledged in a legal deposition taken in connection with the civil suits that he confronted the priest in 1974.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>\'\'We don\'t want to give the impression that it\'s a rampant problem for the church, because it is not,\'\' said the Rev. Kenneth Doyle, a spokesman for the United States Catholic Conference in Washington. \'\'But even one case is too many.\'\' </p>
</blockquote>
<p>\'\'He\'s going to admit it all,\'\' Mr. Mouton said. \'\'We will prove that he did those things. To do otherwise would force all these kids to come into the courtroom and testify.\'\'  <a href="http://archive.is/GhAnH">http://archive.is/GhAnH</a> </p>

<p>The Gauthe Brothers: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Luck and the Catholic Church had kept him (Gilbert) out of jail for years. He had been an active pedophile since his youth, when both he and his younger brother, Richard, a Boy Scout leader, had molested scores of children. Richard Gauthe, who had been ousted from the Air Force and the Scouts for abusing children.. </p>

<a href="http://archive.is/vdtgJ">http://archive.is/vdtgJ</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Special Justice served for Gilbert Gauthe</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Then (Stansbury) said Judge Politz told him he had talked with the bishop in Lafayette, the archbishop in New Orleans, Paul Phelps (former head of the state prison system) and Gov. Edwin Edwards about Gauthe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In my mind it was clear that whatever was going on was wrong,&quot; Mouton said. &quot;I wrote a letter to both Gauthe and Judge Politz and I quit, withdrew as Gauthe\'s attorney and never again had any contact with either Gauthe or Judge Politz.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>By that time, Gauthe no longer wanted to be moved from Wade where Richard Stalder, current head of the state prison system and a man who describes Politz as &quot;a friend and a mentor,&quot; was then warden.</p>
<p>Gauthe was given special status there. Despite the terms of his conviction, he was never given Depo-Provera at Wade. He was housed in a maximum-security area where he was assigned one of the few air-conditioned rooms in the building as his &quot;office.&quot;</p>
<p>It was a glass enclosure in which he did oil painting and made signs for Stalder; those paintings soon covered the windows, hiding Gauthe from view. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Behind those paintings, current and former guards say, Gauthe was allowed to carry on sexual trysts with teen-age prisoners he chose as assistants. He was given his pick among the juveniles who had been tried as adults and were housed in Wade\'s maximum-security area.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Periodically, Gauthe would be visited by Politz and Monsignor Murray Clayton of Shreveport, La. The pair became regular visitors to Gauthe and the late Robert Melancon, another convicted pedophile priest who has since died of AIDS (SEE CORRECTION). Also present during those meetings were Gauthe\'s friends, murderer [name redacted], who was one of Gauthe\'s teen-age assistants, and [name redacted], an adult prisoner then serving time for robbery.</p>
<p>In addition, Gauthe\'s favorable treatment extended beyond the walls of Wade. He was granted extended furloughs to visit his ailing mother. These furloughs ranged from weeks to a month, during which he spent his nights in the Napoleonville jail and his days at his mother\'s bedside.</p>
<p>According to prison guards, Gauthe was exempt from many of the rules in Wade. Several of those officers requested anonymity, although one, retired Lt. Greg Faust, said he conducted a search of Gauthe\'s office.</p>
<p>&quot;I had written him up at least 20 times for various violations,&quot; said Faust, &quot;mostly putting his hands on other prisoners, fondling them in the halls, and nothing happened.</p>
<p>&quot;Officers would tell him to keep his hands off the other prisoners and he\'d just look at you and tell you to leave him alone.</p>
<p>&quot;Then, one night, several of us decided to have a look in that office of his.&quot;</p>
<p>In a desk, said Faust, he found pornographic cartoons drawn by Gauthe and a plastic bag filled with pubic hair.</p>
<p>&quot;I stapled the bag and the drawings to an infraction report and turned it in,&quot; said Faust. &quot;Not only did nothing happen to Gauthe, the next day I was told (by a superior officer) to stay out of his personal effects.&quot;</p>
<p>Nor did Gauthe spend 20 years or even half that time in prison. With the aid of attorneys secured by Politz, Gauthe was released in 1995 after serving less than nine years.</p>

             the Los Angeles Times' investigation found that the collection also chronicled patterns the Scouts shared with the Roman Catholic Church and Penn State abuse scandals of recent years, including the organization's failure to report hundreds of cases of alleged abuse to police, and often hiding of allegations from parents.

             The BSA of America also has some very famous past members in Racine Wi.  Rance Preibus  Paul Ryan and Scott Walker, according to

             were all Boy Scouts and if you check their donations I am sure you will find they were very generous to BSA.  BSA has been infiltrated and is a very corrupt and criminal org. There may be those honest moms and dads in small towns that are doing the right thing, but the people in charge are the problem.

             A reminder about Sandusky

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Now, further evidence that Jerry Sandusky’s TSM was being used to traffic underage boys to wealthy donors took a major step forward via a July 19 interview with Greg Bucceroni, currently employed as a school police officer in the Philadelphia, Pa. school district while also volunteering with the District Attorney’s office.
             </p>
             <p>
              Bucceroni told this reporter, “In 1979 and 1980—when I was 13 and 14 years old—a well-connected pedophile named Edward Savitz took me on trips from Philadelphia to TSM fundraisers. I knew the minute I got there it was a breeding ground because of Savitz’s involvement. While [Jerry] Sandusky interacted with wealthy donors, the other men were sizing-up kids. I felt like a cheap whore because I was in these naked pictures that Savitz was passing around.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Sexually abused victims who testified at the Sandusky trial in Bellefonte, Pa. confirmed this point.
             </p>
             <p>
              As questioning turned to other individuals at these get-togethers, Bucceroni remarked, “They were obviously wealthy—like doctors, attorneys, politicians and businessmen—and I could tell some were married from their wedding rings. But their body language gave away their intentions. On my second trip to TSM, I went with Savitz, another pedophile, and a boy my age. Savitz mingled with the other adults, discreetly showing them child porn pictures that he’d brought along.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               These are the kinds of places where guys from New York, Jersey and Pa. interact. Plus, with all the Penn State hoopla, TSM promoted itself as an alternative to jail or juvenile hall. They said it was the best thing since peanut butter and jelly. But Sandusky is just one in a handful of them. I hope you shine a light on this society of pedophiles.”
