            Do you have any idea how many people work for the State Department?
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you really think the Secretary of State knows who the assistant FSO in Makati, Philippines is?
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you think Secretary Clinton or any other Secretary of State knew about his dude?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also his crimes lasted until 2018. He was distributing child pornography.  Does that make him Foreign Service officer under Trump's State Dept or Pompeo's State Department?
           </p>
           <p>
            This seems like a pretty big reach.

             I know Hillary suppressed investigations into pedophiles within the State Department:

            </p>
            <p>
             I know Hillary helped Laura Silsby get out of her rap for trying to steal 33 children out of Haiti.  I know Laura Silsby now works for the company that puts out the Amber Alerts.  I know Hillary's campaign manager was John Podesta, whose Wikileaks emails were talking about some stuff that pretty clearly involved the abuse of children.
            </p>
            <p>
             In other words, Hillary has a history of hanging out with pedophiles and protecting them too.  So, doesn't seem like such a big reach to me.

              This is false.
             </p>
             <p>
              All these claims were investigated by the Inspector General. The IG report which came out a year after these leaks to the media showed that these claims that Clinton intervened in any way in these cases were false.  Of course, the media didn't report on the IG report.
             </p>
             <p>
              For one, these cases involved the Diplomatic Security Service and never rose to the level of the Secretary.
             </p>
             <p>
              For two, the source of these claims, didn't work on any of these cases.  She was repeating gossip she heard around the office.  She didn't know the facts on hand.

             <p>
              This is completely false.  Silsby was found guilty in a Haitian court.  The State Department and the White House rejected calls by Baptist leaders to intervene on Silsby's behalf. The Haitian judicial system lowered the charges against her, despite the  wishes of the Haitian prime minister because she had the consent of the children's parents to take them...this probably is why she didn't face a kidnapping charge.

             <p>
              This company does NOT PUT OUT the Amber Alerts. They just manufacture the equipment.  Amber Alerts are put out by law enforcement and the program is coordinated within the US Department of Justice.  Glock makes pistols used by lots of US police departments.  Glock does not tell them to  when to pull the trigger.
             </p>
             <p>
              and what does this have to do with Clinton anyway?  She has nothing to do with this company.

              This is laughable.  "pretty clearly"  Wow.  This is not even part of the pizzagate myth, the myth is that nothing was pretty clearly described but a secret "code" was used.
             </p>
             <p>
              Of course, in reality, there are absolutely no code words used in the Podesta emails.  The code was a hoax made up and passed around by a white nationalist.  That code simply did not exist prior to the Podesta email leak.  It was invented.

             <p>
              Nope.  The Podesta thing is a hoax and Hillary had no involvement with Silsby before she was arrested and not involvement after she was arrested. The State Department was involved with the 10 arrested Baptists because the State Department provides consular services to Americans arrested overseas.  It's one of their most important missions

            OMG - The post by HRCisDONE is the BEST group of articles and photos I HAVE SEEN TO DATE! Thank you from the bottom of my heart for posting them. They will be invaluable to those of us that have the unpleasant task of Red Pilling the Lefties in the coming days. I plan to share them carefully but I AM sharing them. We have to get this TRUTH out!
