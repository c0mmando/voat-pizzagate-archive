Since then more people have either contributed research or just reminded me to get off my butt and update the tree, so I have done that and uploaded three new reports from my genealogy software to reflect the added info. </p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/user/Poncho567">@Poncho567</a> had posted info on uncles, aunts, cousins, on the Alefantis side here: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1460709">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1460709</a> 
<a href="https://voat.co/user/hunk_quark">@hunk_quark</a> did some digging on childhood information and assumed names used by James Alefantis, and as a result of that I was able to confirm the identity of James\' maternal grandparents. (For that post see here: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1500147">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1500147)</a>).</p>
<p>And thanks to <a href="https://voat.co/user/PieInTheEye">@PieInTheEye</a>, when I resume trying to see if I can get some back further on Louis Alefantis, James\' grandfather, I\'ll have to do some poking to see if there\'s an connection between the Italian surname Alefanti and Alfanos of the Pizza Connection trial (For that, see here: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1502936/7299833">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1502936/7299833</a> ).</p>
<p>Ok, now that\'ve gone over that, onto the new information I found. I was finally able to figure out the identity of Susan Reid Shoemaker Alefantis\' parents and subsequent ancestors. I tried to limit the information I entered into the database or added to the reports in some cases, because as you\'ll see, some of her family lines go back pretty far and I doubt people will care if James Alefantis is descended from 50 of Charlemagne\'s kids, and it probably won\'t be relevant either. So I tried to focus a bit. What I found most interesting was the obituary I dug up on Susan\'s uncle William Grattan Shoemaker Jr., which is included in the report notes. He was a prominent lawyer in Buffalo, and was involved with the Boy Scouts among other things. In more mundane genealogical terms, the other thing that stuck out about her family tree is that she\'s a Mayflower descendant. But being a Mayflower descendant does not automatically translate into wealth or political power in this country, so the relevance of that only goes so far.</p>
<p>Anyway, I\'ve uploaded three reports. The first one is the updated ancestor report for James with all of the ancestors I\'ve included, second one is a descendant report for James\' grandfather Louis Alefantis that reflects the added stuff on his extended family on his father\'s side of the family, and the third is a descendant report for his great-grandfather William Grattan Shoemaker Sr. reflecting his mother\'s extended family. </p>

           , when I resume trying to see if I can get some back further on Louis Alefantis, James' grandfather, I'll have to do some poking to see if there's an connection between the Italian surname Alefanti and Alfanos of the Pizza Connection trial (For that, see here:

            , and it seems that there are two families in particular connected to this property holding company and its activities.

Alefantis was involved with Transformer and David Brock by 2003, nearly 2 years before he decided to get into the restaurant business affiliated with the CONNEB properties (Buck's is still Title owned by CONNEB II LLC, and Alefantis only owns the Lease and the operating company BIG BUCKS LLC).

            , Carla Cohen's younger brother. Mark only became a master baker after the age of 50, and before that was a political operative for the Democratic Party, though there are links between the ADA group and the Solcialist Party of America, which basically had an internal love affair with the Democratic Party through liberal Jewish families such as the Cohen's and Furstenberg's (some real academic movers and political operatives in these families).
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, this U.S., Furstenberg family are from Sweden --
            <em>
             emigrated in 1907 before the Bolshevik Rev. in Russia
            </em>
            -- and what pricked my attention, as such, was that

             <em>
              Vladimir Lenin's #1
             </em>
            </strong>
            banker who passed the Wall Street funds through Sweden (according to Antony Sutton's "Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution") was a Jewish banker named
            <strong>
             <em>
              Jacob Furstenberg (alias, Yakov Ganetsky

              )
             </em>
            </strong>
            , part of a Jewish banking coalition between the Warburg's and Furstenberg's (there was a Carl Furstenberg in Berlin who was Warburg's fellow traveller in banking also).
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, there were not many Furstenberg Jewish families --

            because Stalin was technically an ethnic Russian who resented Jewish partisan politics ... in private company only of course, because Stalin said one thing openly, and did the opposite privately, like any good Communist).

             Ok, I can start a separate database for Furstenberg &amp; Cohen and work on their trees to see where they may fit in, and if I can get them back to their "old countries." I may need people to look at the reports I upload with different eyes than mine because someone may catch a possible connection I won't that needs further investigation. It's one thing for me to notice the Snow surname in Alefantis' tree and realize I need to investigate the possible LDS connection, but this may be a little more challenging. I'll get started soon!

              You're a gem. I will keep you in the loop on any info I also manage to locate, as I have been hammering away at the Furstenberg Sweden connection ... which I have definitely confirmed. Finding online info from Swedish sources regarding the Furstenberg (Ganetsky) banking family of Lenin infamy, has, however, been frustrating. Even connecting Carl Furstenberg banker connected with Warburg in Berlin to the Swedish Furstenberg (Ganetsky) has been frustrating. It would help if I understood Swedish or German or had access to resources in those countries, so perhaps a

               A social worker and homemaker, Edith Furstenberg dedicated her life to family and the pursuit of social justice. Born in Baltimore in 1910, she was a member of the large Hollander family. Encouraged by her father's liberal views on education, Edith attended Goucher College, traveled alone in Europe as a young woman, and graduated from New York School of Social Work in 1933. Edith worked in the field of child welfare in New York City until her marriage to Dr. Frank Furstenberg in 1934. The couple moved to Baltimore, where they raised a family of six children, Carla, Mark, Frank Jr., Michael, Ellen and Anne. On several occasions, Edith assumed responsibility for moving their large family when her husband was assigned to medical positions in the Public Health Service during World War II. After a seventeen-year hiatus, she returned to social work, specializing in providing services to children with special needs and their families. An independent and energetic woman, Edith continued to travel and enjoy her large circle of family and friends until her death on February 2, 2015.
