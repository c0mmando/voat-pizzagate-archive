            I've heard some rumors (good source, but can't confirm) that they were after Scalia because he was talking about the possibility that Justice Roberts was blackmailed.

            For near death experience - Check out "DMT the spirit molecule" by Rick Strassman. Incidentally his research into the naturally occurring hallucinogen DMT was funded by the Scottish Rite branch of Freemasonry under the guise of "helping schizophrenic children."

            I practice "urban" shamanism. There are definitely dark entities in these other realms. You have to learn to project your cord to fully explore without being traumatized in one way or another. Entheogens are like a tool, they can be used for good or bad. Just giving it to a random person is like giving a cave man a nuclear reactor. You have to know how to use it. Ritual and intent are the most important parts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't classify all shaman or entheogen/psychedelic as "bad". They have healed many.

            This practice goes back to the dawn of man. I doubt anyone who brings up shamans have studied the history of shamanism or know much about this.

           <p>
            On November 12, 2008, a couple near the northern California city of Eureka found 23-year-old Christine Walters naked and bleeding on their doorstep. They took the incomprehensible young woman to a hospital, where she refused to explain what had happened to her. After she was discharged, Walters told her mother in Wisconsin that she had been chased by demons through a forest after she participated in a shamanic ritual.
           </p>
           <p>
            Her mother offered to fly to California to get her, but Walters insisted that she would fly back to Wisconsin by herself. According to her mother, Walters acted paranoid on the phone over the next few days. She believed that the forest demons were trying to hunt her down. She couldn’t say why she was bleeding and naked that day because the demons would hear her. On November 14, Walters left her ID and backpack at a coffee shop and walked out. She was never seen again.
           </p>
           <p>
            Walters had been staying on the West Coast for the four months preceding her disappearance. She had fallen in love with northern California’s natural beauty and alternative lifestyle scene. According to friends and family back home, she had met a group of like-minded spiritualists. Walters was a trusting person, and it’s possible that she might have become involved with a dangerous crowd among the alternative community.

            There is a weird case in Ca. connected to a girl who did a shamanistic tea ceremony and went crazy. It's on the top ten mysteries of California.

             Ayahuasca can make you do some crazy shit.  You basically vomit and then face every possible fear imaginable.  In the wrong hands, it can absolutely be treacherous to someone's mental state, potentially permanently.

              Ayahuasca gets you so high you dont really move around and shit. its like you sit back and take off exploring the dimensions of your own mind so much shits going on you feel no need to move.... well thats me at least. you do vomit though.
