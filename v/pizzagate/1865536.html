<p>I believe this post ought to have received a lot more attention than it did. To quote one of the commenters on the original post, Pizzalawywer, who I believe, does a wonderful job explaining as to why it ought to have gotten more attention.</p>
<p>Quote: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This post is very, very important because the behavioral analysis provides an authoritative label and definition to the phenomenon which Pizzagaters have been researching when they zero in on Alefantis, Podesta and company, much like having a &quot;profile&quot; for certain kind of criminals, a serial killer or kidnapper, etc. Here we have a &quot;profile&quot; for a particular kind of criminal enterprise. Up till now I\'ve been relying on &quot;pedo-subculture&quot; to explain to others what has been found thus far since there have not yet been any discernable victims. But now we have an identifying label &amp; definition to validate the researchers work product. This behavioral analysis approach also permits a more expansive definition of victims. Children at large are victims of the bands like Heavy Breathing playing at CPP. Caris Cummings/James is a victim when her photos are displayed to the public with sexuallly charged labels. Those 3 boys blindfolded before an alter are victims. Carole Greenwood\'s son was a victim. Alefantis\' employee who didn\'t reveal his identity was a victim even though he was 19. NCMEC includes young adults as potential victims of sexual exploitation. Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong should have been investigated by the proper authorties last fall because researchers had already uncovered sufficient evidence that met the above criteria of a criminal enterprise. Good job HereticalPeasant.</p>

<p>Also additionally, if you take the time to read the literature which was originally shared, written by a former FBI Officer, Kenneth Lanning in cooperation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation: <strong><em>&quot;Child Sex Rings: A Behavioral Analysis&quot;</em></strong> , which is used as law enforcement education and training materials for criminal justice professionals handling cases of child sexual exploitation, Lanning states this in his preface, which further emphasizes the importance of the approach expressed in the above comment by Pizzalawyer. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In 1983 and 1984, when I first began to hear stories of what sounded like satanic or occult activity in connection with allegations of child sex rings (allegations that have since come to be re­ferred to most often as &quot;ritual&quot; child abuse), I tended to believe them. I had been dealing with bizarre, deviant behavior for many years and had long since realized that almost anything is pos­sible. Just when you think that you have heard it all, along comes another strange case. The idea that there are a few cunning, secretive individuals in positions of power somewhere in this country regularly killing a few people as part of some satanic ritual or ceremony and getting away with it is certainly within the realm of possibility…&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have devoted more than seven years part-­time, and eleven years full-time, of my profes­sional life to researching, training, and consulting in the area of the sexual victimization of children. The issues of child sexual abuse and exploitation are a big part of my professional life\'s work. I have no reason to deny their existence or nature. In fact, I have done everything I can to make people more aware of the problem. Some have even blamed me for helping to create the hysteria that has led to these bizarre allegations. I can accept no outside income and am paid the same salary by the FBI whether or not children are abused and exploited-and whether the number is one or one million. As someone deeply con­cerned about and professionally committed to the issue, I did not lightly question the allegations of hundreds of victims of child sexual abuse and exploitation...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The reason I have taken the position I have is not because I support or believe in &quot;satanism/\' but because I sincerely believe that my approach is the proper and most effective investigative strategy. I believe that my approach is in the best interest of victims of child sexual abuse. It would have been easy to sit back, as many have, and say nothing publicly about this controversy. I have spoken out and published on this issue because I am concerned about the credibility of the child sexual abuse issue and outraged that, in some cases, individuals are getting away with molest­ing children because we cannot prove the allega­tions of some people that these individuals are satanic devil worshipers who engage in brain­washing, human sacrifice, and cannibalism as part of a large conspiracy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We need to be concerned about the distribu­tion and publication of unsubstantiated allega­tions of bizarre sexual abuse. Information needs to be disseminated to encourage communication and research about the phenomena. The risks, however, of intervenor and victim &quot;contagion&quot; and public hysteria are potential negative aspects of such dissemination. Because of the highly emotional and often religious nature of this topic, there is a greater possibility that the spreading of information will result in a kind of self-fulfilling prophesy. If such extreme allegations are going to be disseminated to the general public, they must be presented in the context of being assessed and evaluated, at least, from the professional perspec­tive of the disserninator and, at best, also from the professional perspective of relevant others. This is what I will attempt to do in this discussion.&quot;</p>

            The CIA Mossad backed Luciferians are forced to reveal themselves because it is all or nothing time for them.  They just make it easier to know our true enemies by their fruits.  We are watching and marking who moves now.  And we do not forget.

            HP: You did better second time around. Amusingly, one clueless person thought you were shopping for votes. Even more interesting are the entries by Im_with_her and After_hours_pizza which were only directed to your post today and no others. Are they concerned that the noose might be tightening around Comer Ping Pong' s criminal enterprise?

             hehee... I am going to make more posts about this. Series of posts. To further refine our methods of public outreach and sharpen our red pilling skills. Because that is the key. It is not the quantity but rather the quality of our tremendous research which needs to be the focus.

            Really don't think that "religion" is involved in SRA but rather that it is a distortion of human spirituality.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Old Religions preceded the later religions by thousands and thousands of years.
There was no Satan and no Devil in the Old Religions and there was no Heaven and no Hell in those religions.
The Old Religions were based in Nature.
The New Religions are based in exploitation of Nature, Natural Resources -- and humans - for the benefit of "Elites."
Certainly the exploitation of humans is historic in Genocide and Slavery and continues on in various myths of "inferiority" of humans resulting in their oppression and discrimination and violence against them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since the 1960's and the coup on JFK, the right wing/Elites have tried to portray our world as largely insane as
one after another of "events" have shown us what seem like "Manchurian Candidates" behaving madly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our TV's and media have been filled with this violence which was also helped along by the fake Drug War.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our world isn't insane, but it does seem to be under the control of Elites who are insane in their quest for total control over the population and the planet in their greed and quest for power.

             To understand the human relationship with the world of spirit you've first got to understand the human condition. Fundamentally it is a security relationship with the state. It is characterized by a a focus on emotional response at the expense of reason: the human heart is the seat of the emotions but reason is relegated to the human mind. This contrasts with the earlier consciousness of mankind where emotion and intellect were well integrated and thus less vulnerable to the confusion of internally inconsistent beliefs about the divine and manipulation by those who use religion for political purposes.

            Agree with DarkMoth, been here since the beginning now the best for me is to switch off, but can't help looking on Voat still.  I quickly scan titles for break throughs &amp; new leads.  I try to limit exposure to the sickness.  Im leaning towards the OTO/Crowley/Babylonian ways have always been here they have always ruled us knowing that makes me free.  I can tell others, raise awareness... we all had our hopes in Trump but can see the swamp is suckling him down, perhaps evan Ivanka/Jared alrrady sold their soul's

            I hadn't seen your comment previously. Will definitely use quotes from FBI Officer Lanning to red pill people.

             It would have been easy to sit back, as many have, and say nothing publicly about this controversy. I have spoken out and published on this issue because I am concerned about the credibility of the child sexual abuse issue and outraged that, in some cases, individuals are getting away with molest­ing children because we cannot prove the allega­tions of some people that these individuals are satanic devil worshipers who engage in brain­washing, human sacrifice, and cannibalism as part of a large conspiracy."

             My guess is you think E Y Orrea is a dodgy person possibly into child trafficking, because of what you have seen in your links.  Make it simple, make it easy.

              Maybe not.  Stratfor has possibly dodgy links to fourkitchens, which may be a pedofront.

            However, while I was going through Ted Gunderson's files that were dumped a couple months back (which I linked in a post), I stumbled upon a file in which
            <strong>
             Gunderson was exposing Lanning as being a Satanist.
            </strong>
            I urge everybody to take Lanning's teachings with a grain of salt.

             One of the most difficult challenges of indie research and reporting on controversial topics is knowing who's legit and who's not. Many of my highly informed and skilled journo friends still accept the Snowden narrative. I do not, but feel I need to remain open.
            </p>
            <p>
             In all appearance of his personal research into SRA, etc., and his personal appearances Gunderson checks out. But there are problems. Consider just the 2 that come to mind. Gunderson headed the LA County office of the FBI during the peak of CoIntel-Pro. That area was steeped in its activities. Ed Opperman told me about a woman he wanted to interview and later did. Can't recall her name. Ted  stayed at her home while attending a nearby conference for 2 weeks. She claimed each night he would have a call with Michael Aquino. You're probably familiar with him and I'm aware this is just scuttlebutt.

             Not raining on parades or being a contrarian. Just sharing. I too agree that the material posted can be useful and may be valid independent of claims regarding its author.

              Gunderson fell for the 9/11 official story.
             </p>
             <p>
              He thinks Arabs with box cutters demolished all seven buildings of the WTC, and that planes disappear into the ground, and that airliners can plow at ground level into the most surveilled bldg on earth without a single snapshot let alone video. Apparently the MIT Media Lab got lazy. No one in public life even questioned the "disappearance" of trillions of dollars, announced on Sept. 10th, and even more looted later on.

              Snowden is a complete fraud for those of us who have been paying attention to what he actually has said--absolutely nothing whatsoever that was not already in the public domain for many, many years. The real whistle blowers were murdered long before.
             </p>
             <p>
              VOAT is followed by those who are spying on everything already.
             </p>
             <p>
              Pizzagate is different because even those who care nothing about who really runs the show, are revolted by the depravity that is upon us.

              The censorship is getting absurd at this point.

               Ok, let me just say that I agree with what you said regarding Snowden and the censorship. Regarding Gunderson and the 9/11 story (even though I firmly believe that it was an inside job), I have to come to his defense here. I don't believe Gunderson was as familiar with it as he was with Satanism, Child trafficking &amp; sacrifice and Elitist Pedophilia. Remember that he retired in 1979 and then went on to do some independent investigative work, starting with the Jeffrey R. McDonald case (which is the case that woke him up), went on to warn about the proliferation of secret Satanic groups, and the danger posed by the New World Order, a shadow government that would be controlling the US government, exposed the Finder's Cult (CIA), McMartin case, the Franklin Cover up &amp; Boys Town and then even said that the 1993 World Trade Center Bombing was a result of FBI agent provocateurs. He died in 2011 and even though the 9/11 truth movement had already arose, there were still many skeptics and counter-arguments going on at the time. It was in 2012 (1 year after Gunderson's death) that Jeff Boss ran in the 2012 US presidential election on a 9/11 Truth platform. So, imho, Gunderson may have missed or perhaps, (from old age and the fact that he was, for a long time before his death, suffering from illnesses and was, in the end, exposed to arsenic, thus dying of arsenic poisoning), was not in his right mind to be able to distinguish, implicate himself more, or thoroughly research 9/11. I don't think we can fairly hold this against him. Wouldn't you agree?

                I hear what you are saying. What I wrote does not detract from what he said about child trafficking etc., but he never disclosed what and who was behind it for real--he just gave part of the story to deflect scrutiny away form those responsible.
               </p>
               <p>
                However, it is not just the phenomenon of compartmentalization, it is compliance with the biggest cover up in decades.
               </p>
               <p>
                There is no need to "research" 9/11 to have known, on the day it happened, that it was not as presented in any way shape or from. But Nixon was right about this: "the American people will believe anything they see on television".
               </p>
               <p>
                No one in Manhattan saw or heard any plane. They saw and heard explosions. How did cars miles away on FDR drive get destroyed? Jet fuel melts steel but doesn't burn the avalanche of paper, including a stolen passport?
               </p>
               <p>
                For heaven's sake most Americans do not know that there was building 3, 4, 5, and 6 which were destroyed as well--all belonging to Silverstein.
               </p>
               <p>
                So, Gunderson never heard of John P. O'Neill, the FBI man who was a counter terrorism expert who had worked on the 1993 bombing run, etc.? He didn't know that O'Neil was going to blow the lid off the whole thing, but he was murdered on 9/11? His body was supposedly recovered, although the buildings and their contents were turned to dust.
               </p>
               <p>
                Gunderson knew that over two hundred men were arrested on 9/11 and
                <strong>
                 none
                </strong>
                of them were "insiders" or Muslims. The DOJ headed by dual citizen Michael Chertoff (his last name means 'son of the devil') released them all to Israel, including the "dancing Israelis" who were all set up, celebrating and filming the destruction of the towers form their vantage point in NJ. Later on Israeli TV they said they were there to "document it". Chertoff then became head of Homeland Security, which rules over all alphabet agencies and law enforcement in the US.
               </p>
               <p>
                The secret Satanic groups are all directed by the CIA.

             Thanks for the information. Lanning might have stared at the abyss for a little too long. Or his investigation has touched a nerve and made him a smear/desinfo target. Why trust Ted Gunderson more than Kenneth Lanning? Either way, Lanning's report is the best synthesis about organized pedo-criminality I've seen to date. It exposes pedo rings' MO and patterns almost scientifically. Yes, we should triple cross-check with other sources available. And ultimately measure and test its explanatory power against real groups, activities, events we are witnessing today. Maintaining my OP upvote and giving you one.

              In my opinion, I think we should use his training materials to our advantage. Because it is an accepted credible mainstream source of research, education and training into the issue. No one can argue against it. Hence making our case stronger.

              I read the entire paper and I also agree with Gunderson on this matter, as I found Lanning dismantling the religious body of faith and Christianity, comparing and encouraging LE to view these subjects as a threat and as dangerous cult members, thus playing his part in the NWO agenda. That in itself is biased and it also tells me that Lanning is indeed siding with Satan. Read through the lines and you'll find that he encourages us to view Satanism as just another religion. Is that what we really want? To let him normalize Satanism? Gunderson wasn't fooled and so won't I. It's up to you to decide if you want to accept this rhetoric, however, sadly, LE wasn't given that choice as he was their primary source of information.
             </p>
             <p>
              Btw, there are many other, unbiased, excellent papers out there on Satanism.

               I see your point. But please keep in mind that FBI's focus is (or at least should be) crime not theology. Lanning's study is an FBI technical document, not a theological treaty. 
He writes on p. 40 : "It makes no difference what spiritual belief system was used to enhance and facilitate or rationalize and justify criminal behavior. It is best to focus on the crime and all the evidence to corroborate its commission (...)." 
It's difficult to disagree with that. Who cares what satanists call themselves. Podesta for instance, considers himself a christian catholic. Satan is a deceiver. "You will know them by their fruits" said Jesus.  Read further on p.40: "Cases are not solved by decoding signs, symbols, and dates using undocumented satanic crime "manuals." In one case, a law enforcement agency executing a search warrant seized only the satanic paraphernalia and left behind the other evidence that would have corroborated victim statements. Cases are solved by people- and behavior-oriented investigation. Evidence of satanic or occult activity may help explain certain aspects of the case (i.e., link multiple offenders explain specific acts, etc.\ but even offenders who commit crimes in a spiritual context are usually motivated by power, sex, and money."

               I understand what you're saying. Believe me. As Chrisitan myself I agree with you. What I'm suggesting is that, even despite that, we can however still weaponize his research and use it against them. As Christ said, be gentle as doves, but wise as serpents. What I'm suggesting is, using what is truthful and accurate within Lanning's materials (and there is a lot that is indeed accurate fits the patterns which we've examined in pizzagate) to build the credibility for our findings. He is a mainstream source used for training law enforcement officials and agencies. If we use his credibility and stand on it with our findings as the justification for our conclusions and evaluations of the forensic evidence which has been gathered, then what will tell people?  - that law enforcement training is "fake news" or "conspiracy theory"? What's the D.C. police going to do, debunk the very training which they themselves received in order to investigate these crimes?

             Exactly. This is why I reposted this for everyone to see and study up on.
            </p>
            <p>
             We need to push the evidence we have collected based on bona fide documented authorative law enforcement research into the phenomena. It gaves us and all pf our research so much more credibilty. Because think about it, what then will they do? Will they then say that the FBI and the law enforcement training materials are "fake news"?

            <p>
             They will look like clowns.
            </p>
            <p>
             We must base our public outreach on evidence based authoritative law enformcent materials. Why? Because they are mainstream, acceptable sources.
            </p>

             What's the metrolpolitian PD going to do? Debunk the very same training that they received into investigating these cases?????
            </p>
            <p>
             We need to think and talk like the police. We need use their training, their education and their lingo.

            An interesting psychological link to PG is the pedophiles' need to collect art material relating to pedophilia, similar to Tony Podesta.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The preferential child molester's motivations
for collecting the material are that it fuels his
sexual fantasies, validates his behavior, and is a
souvenir of his relationship with the child. Many
preferential child molesters do not possess commercial
child pornography because it is difficult
to obtain in the United States. The preferential
child molester who is operating a child sex ring is
very likely to have sexually explicit and
nonsexually explicit visual depictions of the victims.

            <p>
             Exactly. PIZZAGATE deals with what Lanning calls, "True Pedophiles" or "Preferential offenders"
            </p>
            <p>
             I believe these pedophiles have taste preferences and likes and dislikes. They intentionally seek out children who fit the qualities they find attractive. I believe these pedophiles can also be picky about selecting which child suits their fancy. They don't just settle for whatever kids are available to them. No. They seek after kids who fit what they are looking for.
            </p>
            <p>
             Think of it like this: it's like going to buffet and picking out whatever you desire and want to eat vs. Being handed a plate of food and whatever is on the plate, well that's all there's is. So you either eat or you go hungry.
            </p>
            <p>
             So
            </p>
            <p>
             True pedophiles or preferential offenders = dine at a buffet
            </p>
            <p>
             Situational offenders = eat the plate they happen to have in in front of them
            </p>
            <p>
             Also true pedophiles, like their kids to look pretty, wear nice clothes etc. They like kids dressed and undressed. They prefer their children to look like works of art.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hence the photography and the art which centers around depictions of children. Not all of it explicit, some are benign, but that's because they prefer both.

            I agree with DarkMath, its huge blocks of texts, so its easy to skip over thinking to go back later. I've been pretty well convinced of the pedophilia, child porn, trafficking, regime change crimes so what is compelling to me now is how it will play out in the political realm and when/how swamp draining and indictments occurs.
           </p>
           <p>
            A professional's opinion is great for confirmation but its not evidence.

             No its not evidence and wasn't intended to be, HPs discovery is a criminal jurisprudence textbook description of the evidence compiled thus far. How is it that we knew instinctively that a particular kind of criminal enterprise was underway and law enforcement didn't? Akin to having all the symptoms of a disease and everyone but the doctor knows its a disease. The answer to my own question is that law enforcement in Washington DC is too corrupt to see it, textbook definitions be damned.

            That's most likely because a lot of us are tapped out mentally. We all are seeing for the first time a fucked up and psychotic world that I'm gathering people learn about over years and not months like we're doing. Every week we feel like a German 88' shell landed about 20 feet away

            The Seth Rich story did it for me this week. They killed a fucking kid. These people don't care and they're running the country and have been running the country for a very long time. That takes a while to process when you grew up thinking we lived in a representative democracy based on the rule of law.

             I couldn't have said that any better. Yes, they killed a kid, and went about their day like any other day.  Of course, they kill people often so I guess it is like any other day.  These people are evil, with absolutely no conscience.  God bless Seth Rich and all the other victims. I know I have changed and realized it when I heard this morning Roger Ailes was dead and I started wondering who bumped him off.  In my more innocent thinking days I would have thought he died of natural causes. Not anymore.

             They not only killed him, but Podesta in his emails writes about making an example to the DNC-leaker, the police does nothing and the MSM can ignore it.

             What to me is most frustrating is not the unspeakable kind of evil of these people. But the stupidity and ignorance of average people. They do not care.
PEOPLE ARE SHEEP. And the most shocking revelation that follows from it: the Luciferian scum is proven right in their contempt for humanity.

             Yes, I learned about this hell over the course of several years. I networked with other sexual abuse survivors and personally spoke with people who have experienced every sick thing we associate with PG: women who were raped by powerful men in law enforcement, the clergy, and government when they were children or teens; women forced to bear babies for sacrifice; women who had to watch the murder of other children or slaughter of animals, often after being allowed to bond with the animals as pets; women who were hunted, and on and on ad nauseum. These are people I know and I know they are telling the truth. It is a horrible reality to come to terms with, and we all need to take breaks in order to maintain our sanity.

             Agreed. I'm on overload. Knowing that Mama Podesta may very well have adopted 25 kids for her sons and other pedos to use, abuse, and throw away did it for me. I couldn't fall asleep, and I was physically sickened and heartbroken. I didn't see this post originally but agree with both

             and the doctor...we have needed to understand the profile so that we could dig into the right places. We also do need an authority to be the voice to the public...someone who has presumably cared for hundreds of children who have suffered from this type of abuse. No matter what my creditials are, yours, DarkMath or Pizzalawyer, we need to have some credibility to our public submissions/persona. People are tuning out, and we won't win them over by hammering them over the heads with red pull after red pill. I will have to read the previous posts later, but appreciate your work and your posts, and please keep going. If we have enough people on this, we'll have some rotating in when the others are fried. It works. Peace. Keep up the fight!

               Oh my gawd, paleez don't comment on something if it's just a criticism about emotion, it makes you look so bad. You must have missed the post, as well, because it indicated much more nefarious activity than what you refer to. People like me won't stop because of people like you. Save your keystrokes for someone who GAF.

             Yeah this is the case.  I was a normal Tea Party type till I followed a couple of links on FreeRepublic.  Links that got shut down almost immediately.  Following these links I bounced around surfing lots of different but related stuff till two weeks after it started I was convinced in a Global Conspiracy of Satanic Masonic Sabbetean Cult of Child Killers and Rapist who are intentionally culling Humanity.  It kind of leaves you in shock.  Then I spent months trying to wake up everyone I personally know.  To little avail outside my personal family.  But I guess we got to saddle up and continue making noise.

             Thank you for putting words to my own feelings, DarkMath. I'm emotionally exhausted &amp; don't want to take breaks because I just want to find a way to end this madness. To free the kids. And even when I do take breaks, I still see references to this stuff everywhere. Movies, TV, even old novels i'm reading - I think people have been trying to get the masses awake for a while. I feel like i'm trying to cram so much knowledge into my brain of how the real world works, &amp; I have less time than ever to do it.

             It has taken a very long time to convince the public that there are a few people among us in every group who wake up every morning trying to figure out how to gain control over others -- and that they will resort to any kind of violence to accomplish that goal.

            <p>
             There are oft repeated tools throughout history used to subdue and steal from the public -
one of the first is Elitism/Royals and the other is religion -- and these tools are used over and again to subdue other nations
and their people.
Christianity gave us Capitalism which is a system intended to move the wealth of nations from the many to the few.
And it has done that successfully all over the world.
             <br/>
             Recall Genocide versus the Native American and the stealing of their land; and our Founders protecting the system
of Slavery for Elites/wealthy which guaranteed the Civil War and which divided the population into two camps of hatred.
            </p>
            <p>
             This combination of Christianity and Capitalism are repeatedly used to infiltrate and co-opt other nations.
Today, the Drug War has been added as a tool to interfere in the affairs of other nations.

             Seth Rich is an especially sad story.  But then last night Chelsea Manning was freed from prison.

             Im just delighted its getting attention again, we pushed for a long time for poor Seth but he was beginning to be forgotten. Wikileaks all but spelled it out for months. Let him show you what people have paid for the price of truth and dust yourself off if you can.

             Good news here there are few nexus points throughout the crimes committed over the past decade by this enterprise, that might unto themselves cause the situation to unravel badly. Wieners laptop is one of these by virtue of what it contains the work put in to create insurance for a failing politician, but Seth is another because of the forces that aligned against his fate. Seth's death was a sloppy desperate act that exposes motives bare naked for all to see, he didnt have the files they were just hours too late. Il bet whoever did this realised without the files they didn't have anything to keep this kid from talking his ass off until his court date, for probably just theft. I cant imagine the panic when they realised he was still alive and breathing with statistically a 95% chance of surviving the injurys as presented, oh for Podesta's cell records that night im sure Mr.Fixit and his brother had a late one. Too many people were involved, theres huge gaping holes in the narritive.

             You are absolutely correct DarkMath. I feel like I opened a door into the bowels of hell and i can never close it. One image and story worse than the other. I'm guilty of being verbose and that can turn off readers. But HereticalPeasant's discovery shows how right we have been based upon our own deep sense of morality, integrity,  and willingness to stand up for victims without a voice. We don't need to explain or aplogize to anybody about the hours many of us spend daily awakening ourselves and others.

            Thanks for calling attention to your post. Upvoated it. I wouldn't pay too much attention to downvoating. It only means you did a great job in getting information out.

            Will look everything over when I get a chance.

            Well, I am glad to read from someone with  high professional experience and background that they believe exactly what we believe could be a possibility.  He has been working on the child sexual ring cases for many years.  It might be a good thing to print out a couple of his pages to red pill your family and friends.  It certainly would be a great beginning.
