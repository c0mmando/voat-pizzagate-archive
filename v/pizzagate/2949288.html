<p>Plus Ça Change...
TODD KLIMAN  MAR 5, 2004 </p>
<p>&quot;When Greenwood, the sensuous, Berkeleyesque restaurant in Upper Northwest, shut its doors for a couple of months last year, rumors abounded. Would chef Carole Greenwood, whose restless soul had driven her to open three different incarnations of her restaurant in three different locations in less than 10 years, return with a fourth Greenwood in a new part of town?&quot;</p>
<p>BUCK\'S FISHING AND CAMPING
&quot;An answer, of sorts, arrived in October, when the curiously named Buck’s Fishing and Camping opened its doors—the very same doors that once belonged to the old restaurant. In fact, aside from a couple of thematic touches, such as the large canoe above the canopied communal table in the center of the dining room, the new restaurant looks an awful lot like the old. And the chef’s sensual, personal cooking remains much the same:&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, there is a dramatic difference, though one perhaps undetectable to the casual observer: It’s the first time Greenwood, a self-described “control freak,” has ever ceded command of the business end. That task falls to James Alefantis, formerly of Johnny’s Half Shell, Greenwood’s new co-owner.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Greenwood was, she says, as good as gone this past summer, determined to start over and begin a new life for herself as a full-time artist.&quot;</p>
<p>ART DEALER/ STRAND ON VOLTA
&quot;It was Alefantis who drew her back. He was, he says, “maxed out” on his job at Johnny’s, longing to strike out on his own.</p>
<p>He took a step toward fulfilling his dream of greater creative autonomy when he opened an art gallery, the Strand on Volta, in Georgetown. He took another, unwitting step when, on the lookout for artists, he decided to become Greenwood’s dealer. When the gallery launched last May with a group show titled “Ground Work,” Greenwood was one of the three featured artists. A one-woman show of her pieces followed in September.&quot;</p>
<p>ALEFANTIS &quot;ARRANGES&quot; CO-RUNNING GREENWOOD
&quot;she was essentially working two jobs at the restaurant but also that her rent there was “ridiculously high.”</p>
<p>He immediately got on the phone with her landlord to negotiate a new lease for her. There was only one hitch: If she wanted this drastically reduced rent, this lease without which he’d told her she couldn’t keep on doing business—well, she couldn’t keep on doing business as she was. Discussions revolved around a single, nonnegotiable stipulation: that Alefantis would be “actively involved” in the restaurant.&quot;</p>
<p>JAMES/CAROLE AND TEEN SON
&quot;...having sublet her house in Mount Pleasant for the summer, Greenwood was now without a place to stay.....Alefantis stepped in, taking in Greenwood and her teenage son, Dylan, at his apartment in Georgetown. One Saturday, typically the busiest day of the week for a restaurant, Greenwood came down with food poisoning. As it happened, Alefantis had a rare night off and so, with an assist from Dylan, he took over the kitchen at Greenwood.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Returning to cooking with Alefantis alongside her, she says, was a way to “make a more gradual transition” to her eventual life as a full-time artist.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She may have agreed to let him adjust her prices to reposition the restaurant as a neighborhood eatery&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She casts a glance at Alefantis. “Would I have stayed in Washington without a gallery show of my work?” She pauses. “No.”&quot;

<p>SHOWS AT THE STRAND
&quot;Illicit Encounters&quot; at Strand on Volta Owned by James Alefantis
&quot;if you look up Strand on Volta... all the links are dead...
Weird.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Artists, writers, politicos, lobbyists and educators gathered at Strand on Volta Gallery to celebrate the opening of cutting-edge works by three international video artists.....allery owner and restaurateur James Alefantis said &quot;Moving images are so stunningly contemporary. It has been incredible to see the response of Washington art collectors to this art form.&quot; Media Ma ers for American President and CEO David Brock, lobbyists Heather and Tony Podesta, The American Prospect senior editor Garance Franke-Ruta, The Washington Post editorial cartoonist Tom Toles and Sculptor Jeff Spaulding were also spotted studying the video works displayed on TV screens and projected onto walls of the gallery.&quot;

<p>Strand on Volta Cuts In To Some Meaty Issues
By Michael O\'Sullivan October 10, 2003</p>
<p>&quot;ODDLY ENOUGH, amid all the images of flesh on view in Strand on Volta\'s latest group exhibition, shown along with examples of some less readily identifiable bodily tissue/fluid sculpted from molten glass -- teeth? a jawbone? sperm? tears? -- the word that springs to mind is not &quot;meat&quot; but &quot;plastic.&quot; As in pliable, capable of being molded, able to deform continuously and permanently without rupturing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is, I think, central to the point of &quot;Meat and You,&quot; a smart if somewhat esoteric show organized by artist James Huckenpahler to underscore not only our relationship to meat but our embodiment of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Meat, after all, is not so much a solid, static thing -- Frank Day\'s grotesquely lovely photos of pig feet and dried dog heads notwithstanding -- as it is a kind of energy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;While the artist has been known to make installations that evoke, in no uncertain terms, bloody entrails draped over meat hooks, that\'s not what he\'s showing here. Sure, the hooks are still there...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;MEAT AND YOU -- Through Oct. 25 at Strand on Volta, 1531 33rd St. NW. 202-333-4663. www.strandonvolta.com. Open Tuesday-Saturday 10 to 4. Free.&quot;

<p>&quot;Meat and You: Works by Graham Caldwell, Frank Day, Stephen E. Lewis and William Newman&quot; 
2003-09-29 until 2003-10-25

&quot;Frank Day�s images of animal fetishes are part of a larger series set in the West African city of Accra. His earlier work includes a study of the persistence of memory amidst the rebuilding of east Berlin in the 1990�s&quot;

&quot;James Alefantis used to own a DC Art Gallery named Strand on Volta! Now owns Transformer gallery. MUST SEE its disturbing!&quot; <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1654738">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1654738</a></p>

<p>&quot;Homage to Noble? Alefantis\' knowledge of Art Brut suggests this poster, made for the weekly Sasha Lord Presents events at Comet Ping Pong, are referencing Satanist abuse.
But it goes deeper. Apparently, The University of London is the world\'s most important producer of art gallery curators. They are colloquially known as the &quot;Courtauld Mafia&quot;. We can see fairly easily that they have graduates working at the TATE, MoMA, Guggenheim etc.
But the school, located on the Strand, seems to be some sort of dogwhistle, because Alefantis\' old gallery--Strand on Volta--appears to be referencing the area. Not only that, but he refers to himself as James Strand Alefantis in the story. If one knew a thing or two about the art world, this would be an obvious reference.&quot; READ ALL!

            'So in Lake Volta there is an island called Dodi Island that is always referred to as a "tourist destination", but I can't figure out why. It appears to be the destination for a cruise, a party boat rides around the lake, stops at the island then rides back. There are also people living on the island, mainly children it sounds like. Here are a couple travel blogs about their visits to Dodi and both bloggers were confused by the children and write about how odd it was seeing the children and how the children would follow them around.

            But then there is this.... an article about a new hotel to be built on Dodi Island and the "Volta River Authority" logo is a freaking triangle inside a triangle with a swirl.

             GHANA WAS A HUGE SLAVE SUPPLIER FOR THE NEW WORLD, including America:
"Just over the Adomi bridge is the unspoiled beauty of Peki Valley. It is the place where the Ewe of Dahomey (modern day Benin) migrated to. Once an important town in the slave trade as it linked the interior with the coastal towns, the area also has caves that sheltered slaves who managed to escape their captors. There’s so much to do– bike or walk from here to Lake Volta..."

            <p>
             "Set sail on the Dodi Princess
The only cruise ship in the entire country traverses Lake Volta and, despite the name, predates the famously doomed relationship between Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed. Built at the Tema Shipyard in 1977 and originally intended to haul cargo, it was converted into a passenger ship in 1991. It has three decks, with the lower one air conditioned, a cocktail bar, an area for barbecuing and even a sick bay. On a good day out, expect photo-worthy views, barbecue lunches and live music on deck. Just 5 km from the shores of Lake Volta is the popular stop, Dodi Island."

             "Between the estuary of the Volta River and the kingdom of Benin, the famous Slave Coast became in the 18th century the most active zone of the slave trade. Beginning from the 1670s, the Bight of Benin underwent a rapid expansion of trade in slaves, which continued until the end of the slave trade in the nineteenth century. In the beginning of the 18th century, Agaja, ruler of the continental kingdom of Dahomey, undertook a set of conquests toward the ocean in order to have a direct hold on the Atlantic trade. Instead of the various animals as the chameleon, the lion or the fish, which his predecessors and successors had chosen as symbols of royalty, this atypical king had a ship as his emblem. Ouidah, the great sanctuary of voodoo, became the main outlet of the slave trade which has left some visible traces still visible today on the organization of the space, notably in Ganvié, a village where people had learned to live on the water in dwellings built on stilts. The Fon, also called Aja, were the builders of the kingdom of Dahomey. The Yoruba built the rival kingdom of Oyo and their dominions reached to the north the territory of the Hawsa. The Fon, the Yoruba also called Nago, and the Hawsa were among the most frequent ethnicities on Louisiana plantations."

             ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE:
"The user also goes further to claim that around the same time, Alefantis was caught by former business partner Carole Greenwood assaulting her young son in the kitchen of Comet Ping Pong. While unproven, the timeline does indeed add up with Greenwood's abrupt abandonment of Comet, citing “urgent family matters”. We can also confirm via a Washington Post article written in 2003 that Greenwood does have a son who would have been 17-18 years old in 2008. Greenwood was unavailable for an interview. According to the accuser, another employee witnessed the assault of Greenwood's son. Those reports were allegedly swept under the rug by the DC police."

              Yes. After abortionburger (a mod) interviewed Dylan and confirmed his real life identity (doxing herself in the process), the shills went wild here trying to discredit her. You can read all about it in the subverse they made to attack her and many other great early PG researchers:
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagateshills">
               v/pizzagateshills
              </a>
              . It took them about a month to figure out her real life identity through her comment history here and on reddit and facebook. Then they started doxing her and harassing her in real life. Several accounts were banned from Voat for posting death threats associated with her RL identity. She eventually got so stressed out, she had to step down as a mod and ultimately left Voat.

              I have zero doubt Alefantis was behind it.

            Every time I've ever read about how Alefantis got Buck's it makes me wonder a couple of things:
           </p>
           <p>
            1.) How could he afford to open up an art gallery if all he was before, at best, was a restaurant manager (at the half shell)?
           </p>
           <p>
            2.) It seems he at least
            <em>
             used
            </em>
            Greenwood, and at worst, completely conned her out of her own restaurant.
           </p>
           <p>
            3.) To have expanded as rapidly as he has done means that again, at best, he has been money laundering, dealing drugs or something, and at worst...well, pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            I didn't realize that he had actually played a part with regards to Greenwood's art dealings. That obviously gave him info and an angle to get in. Then there's the stuff about supposedly getting caught with her son as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shady, shady stuff. We'll crack this bastard one day.

             This is not the best reasoning.  "At best money laundering or dealing drugs," are you kidding?  That's as far as your imagination goes?  He couldn't have inherited a small amount?  Or got an insurance settlement or sold some real estate?
            </p>
            <p>
             Your faulty reasoning seems to come from the idea that it's expensive to open an an art gallery.  It's not.   All you need is a space with 4 white walls.  You can get that pretty cheap, especially if you are not opening in a fashionable area.  The main thing you need is connections to artists who would be willing to show in your gallery.  If you are not going for the high end known artists, but up and coming unknowns this becomes much easier and cheaper to do.  To get artists to agree to show in your gallery, you probably need to show them that you could get people who have money to see your paintings and hopefully buy them.  Someone like Alefantis who has experience in the restaurant world could provide this.  Artists like anyone else need a resume.  Having a list of previous gallery showings looks good for you, it opens doors for you.
            </p>
            <p>
             I just googled art galleries in the neighborhood next to the last cool frontier neighborhood in  Brooklyn I knew about and yup, there's art galleries opening there.  One of them is an old factory and when they opened it, it was in a loft.  The folks who owned it lived there and there and would do exhibitions there.  A lot of these places are just an empty space with four white walls.

              He could have inherited money, yes, but we have no information on any relatives that would suggest this. I don't know about the insurance, but he certainly didn't have any real estate either at this time that we know of. And that art gallery was in a decent location. He had no known status within the art world at this time either, so, what, people just went along with this guy who came from nowhere, with no expertise or experience?
             </p>
             <p>
              And when I speak of laundering or drugs I speak of a means to go from restaurant manager, to art dealer, to multiple restaurant owner etc all within the space of a few years. Most people would take time to build things and become established etc. The gallery he had for what, two years? Then somehow got in with a restaurant, and then another, and then another, and a high ranking position with the Transformer gallery too. There are peices missing in this jigsaw.
             </p>
             <p>
              The big thing I think I missed from my theories is the influence of David Brock. It could well have been him that started all of this by providing the seed money for his then boyfriend Alefantis to produce businesses to launder through.

               I don't really see this as that big a deal, because we have no info that the art gallery cost much to operate.  He had a well-established partner partner in both restaurants and you could easily do a business loan to open Comet.  Bucks was a well regarded restaurant, it doesn't seem like it would be hard to do a business loan.  In old interviews, he said Comet was not a success at first, they were scraping by...in fact the ping pong tables were as a way of drawing customers.

               You're making assumptions here.  We don't know this.  It's not like he just blew into town.  He's obviously interested in art, he could have been part of the DC art scene the whole time he was working at the other restaurant, he could have been making connections for years.  Like I said, if you are going to do a shoe string gallery, connections are more important that money.....and as you note, it only last two years, it's not like it was a success.

               Somehow?  How hard is it to get a job working in a restaurant?  Thousands of people do it.  He lived in NYC for a while and I think he worked in restaurants there if I remember correctly.  As for hooking up with Carole Greenwood, it seems like a match of talents.  See this article. Greenwood was known in DC as a talented chef, but she also seemed to be a pain in the ass.

               She had a reputation for rubbing people wrong in that I'm great chef/artist kind of way.  When she owned her own place she was running the kitchen and the front of the house and she was not good at the front of the house.  That seems to be Alefantis strong suit.  So it seemed like their partnership let each focus on their talent.  Greenwood turned up in a New York kitchen recently, but didn't last very long.

              <p>
               You basically have this suspicion and you are trying to turn all the known facts to be suspicious whether they fit your theory or not.  It could have been Brock who financed it or it could have been anyone else he knew from the art-world-fine dining-gay DC subcultures that he was part of.

""One summer (2003-2004), the summer we turned Greenwood into Buck's Fishing &amp; Camping, Dylan and I stayed with James and David at their grand house in Georgetown.""

              James and David (Brock) were in a relationship at that time (2003-2004). The Strand was up and running in 2003. Carole Green got her promised show at the Strand in 2003. 
 FROM ORIGINAL POST: "Artists, writers, politicos, lobbyists and educators gathered at Strand on Volta Gallery to celebrate the opening of cutting-edge works by three international video artists.....gallery owner and restaurateur James Alefantis said "Moving images are so stunningly contemporary. It has been incredible to see the response of Washington art collectors to this art form." Media Matters for America President and CEO David Brock, lobbyists Heather and Tony Podesta...were also spotted studying the video works displayed on TV screens and projected onto walls of the gallery."

              VERY WEALTHY ELITES WERE IN JAMES' ORBIT AT THAT TIME. Was he recruited by art collector extraordinaire Tony Podesta? He certainly would have had funding and motivation.

               "Rehoboth Beach, Delaware and to a lesser degree its immediate neighbors, Lewes, and Bethany Beach, have become the vacation spots for gays (and others) from nearby Baltimore, Richmond, Philadelphia, and above all D.C.....David Brock, founder of Media Matters for America, had a house there where he hosted Democratic Party fundraisers."
              </p>
              <p>
               "William Grey, previous partner of David Brock, who lived with Brock in the lily white expensive neighborhoods of Georgetown and Rehoboth Beach/Henlopen Acres, before Brock partnered up with James Alefantis and bought a new house in the lily white and expensive Kalorama/Embassy Row neighborhood (where people of color are almost all either the help or Ambassadors), sure has a small internet footprint.  (I’ve been to a gay Democratic fundraiser at the Rehoboth beach manse shortly before Grey’s civil suit forced Brock to sell it.)
Other than his civil suit against David Brock for the return of antiques and art, he seems to have worked in pet rescue and adoption in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware and has now disappeared, with a settlement payment of $850,000 in exchange for silence about Media Matters’ alleged financial misconduct."
              </p>
              <p>
               "David Brock, CEO of the George Soros-backed website Media Matters, dished out $850,000 to an ex-domestic partner after he was threatened with “damaging information involving the organization’s donors and the IRS,” according Fox News.
In a lawsuit settled last year, Brock accused William Grey, his former domestic partner, of repeatedly threatening to expose him to the “scorn or ridicule of his employees, donors and the press in demanding money and property.”
The Media Matters CEO claims he was forced to sell his Rehoboth Beach, DE, home in order to meet Grey’s demands. Grey responded to Brock’s lawsuit by denying that he “committed any ‘acts of blackmail.’”
“Brock’s bitter legal battle with Grey, who is described in a Sept. 14, 2010, police report…as his domestic partner of more than 10 years, began after Brock began dating Washington, D.C., restaurant impresario James Alefantis about five years ago,” Fox News reports."
              </p>
              <p>
               "Brock, 49, heads the non-profit Media Matters for America, which bills itself as a watchdog of the conservative media but has recently come under fire for allegedly coordinating with Democrats in what could be a violation of its tax-exempt status."
              </p>
              <p>
               "Former Vacation home of Media Matters Founder David Brock, a converted inn house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. Brock sold the home in May 2010. The current owner razed the house and divided the plot for two new properties."

             Yep. Great comment. And it appears that he is still at it. Friends in high places. It would be great if a real journalist could track down Greenwood and get her on record.

              WOW!  Found this detailed Q &amp; A with Carole Greenwood from 2008. AMAZING FIND! Lots of info including STORY OF COMET PING PONG SAUCE! It certainly does involve Toigo Farms:
             </p>
             <p>
              "As to the photographs, they are from the first canning of Comet sauce, the tomato sauce i made for the pizzas at Comet Ping Pong. Attached are some newer images from this year's batch.
So the story begins with Mark Toigo, a trusted friend and co-conspirator, who tried and tried to talk me into buying all of his tomatoes at the end of the season to make the pizza sauce....I could have the same consistent sauce for an entire year, made from tomatoes that I had seen, worked with, tasted- and of a quality and consistency I could manage.
So I drove to Punxatawney, Pennsylvania (yes, the same place where the groundhog sees his shadow) and labored (in a hairnet no less) with my friend and colleague - chef David Hagedorn, now a columnist for the Washington Post,
to achieve something that would satisfy my idea for the pizza sauce - a pure flavour of tomato. It was strange to can something on such a large scale - cases and cases rolling out of these seemingly antiquated machines...."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Mark Toigo is a very close friend - someone I consider a member of my extended family- we have known each other for a long time...back to Mark- as oddly enough as it may sound, I deliberately avoided this charismatic man at the markets for a couple of years- I dunno, in some ways I am shy, and his exuberance made me a little nervous. Many chef friends of mine knew him well, had been to his farm in Pennsylvania, and encouraged me to meet him. One sunny Saturday, however, I pulled up to the Falls Church market in my 65 Ford Falcon convertible and he came over to chat. I think he knew who i was, but he made it easy for me, admiring my car- whatever. Well the rest is history.Mark is part of both restaurants- part of who I am as a chef and a person."
             </p>
             <p>
              "my business partner, James Alefantis- "  Carole didn't consider him a chef or cook.
             </p>
             <p>
              "One summer (2003-2004), the summer we turned Greenwood into Buck's Fishing &amp; Camping, Dylan and I stayed with James and David at their grand house in Georgetown." One might assume the David is David Brock. Was he behind funding for Strand on Volta and Comet and Bucks? He and the Tony Podestas showed up at an art opening there.
             </p>
             <p>
              "As to the Comet sauce - though I gave the narrative of how and where the idea of it came from, I never really gave any sort of recipe- though to give you the actual recipe would be misleading as the first ingredient for the 2007 batch is -
2200 pounds of fresh plum tomatoes, peeled and seeded.....This is the basic recipe for the sauce i use on the pizza. I must admit that the 2007 sauce is different from 2006- last year we used a hybrid tomato,
this year we used San Marzano plums."  NO MENTION OF HEIRLOOMS....
