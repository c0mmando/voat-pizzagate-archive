            Career[edit]
           </p>
           <p>
            At the age of
            <strong>
             13
            </strong>
            , Jones was discovered by
            <strong>
             R. Kelly
            </strong>
            and signed to his record label for development as an emerging talent. By age 16, she signed with Capitol Records, and in 2003 she auditioned and was selected to the Pussycat Dolls. After being inducted into the girl group, she went under the tutelage of famed music producer Jimmy Iovine. She quit the group in 2005, claiming that it was no longer fun to be in the band. She told Yahoo! Singapore, "When everyone is not on the same page it affects the group so that I think was the worst part and I decided to leave. It was not because I wanted to be solo and I didn't want to be in a group anymore, I left because it stopped being enjoyable, it stopped being fun."

            Good for her for this. Not sure exactly what to think about the LV thing though and whether anyone really did die, I just don’t know, until there is confirmation and truth someone really did pass away I’m conflicted on that one.
           </p>

            Remember the era of the supermodels in the modeling industry? Elite model agency was pimping out girls and the top supermodels were used this way as well. The price of Monaco was just one of the many men. One girl in particular who was very famous and started at 13 during that time is now completely lost and broke and it is so very sad. Many of these women now live normal lives with no money and no fame whatsoever. They were used and abused by powerful people in the modeling industry. So if it happened back then, imagine it now and across all genres of entertainment, music, acting, modeling, it’s all the same thing. Why the fuck would anyone want fame? It’s soul sucking and destroying all the money in the world won’t help u out of it.

            With the Pussycat Dolls, nice name btw, I don’t doubt this one bit. Robin Antin was the creator and she is also a member of Kabbalah. She is very close with the Kardashian clan. She is a choreographer and singer. Married to some rock guy. She then started the teenage group Girlicious and did some tv show for the group. Melissa Smith aka Melissa Molinaro was one of the girls in the group who was rumoured to be a prostitute and was seen in pics with Dan Bilzerian in his home wearing a bra and panties. She is now married but never really made it. Sells her used clothing on fashion apps online. Still lives in Hollywood still trying to make it lol! Imagine the stories these people could tell. For anyone even thinking of going into this as a career, think twice and hard, it is much better having a normal life with real people and no constant stress and ulterior motives.

             I didn't know much about them. I loved the video Loosen up my buttons but wasn't really into the others. It's really sad to me. I bet a lot of these people don't enjoy this life like they thought they would. Maybe for a season. It's not worth it.

              Simone Battle was found dead on September 5, 2014, at the age of 25. The cause of death was ruled as suicide by hanging.[7] A spokesperson for Battle stated that she suffered from depression due to financial issues."

            If we can all agree that the entertainment industry is merely an advertising platform, then it's really simple to see what's going on here. Some movies promote cars or phones in the background with product placement. Folks, that's what child actors are. They're product placement.

            Good for her! Hopefully, this will encourage more people to come forward. It proves that even though she was "victimized", she's not a "victim"!!!

            I believe this also completely vindicates what we #pizzagaters have been saying all along. She states that the Cannibal Elite use drugs, sex, and compromising situations to blackmail these victims. It keeps the victimized from speaking out. That's pretty much what we concluded, that the elite use blackmail to keep people in line and will do anything to tempt, coerce, and force someone into engaging in shameful behavior in order to control them. #starwhackers

            This is good. Cheered me up no end. Not strictly PG-related but I recommend the mods keep it up for morale reasons.

              There's nothing in her story about pedophilia. The mods have deleted a number of threads that are just about prostitution or sex trafficking of adults.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not looking for a fight here. We both want the thread to stay.
