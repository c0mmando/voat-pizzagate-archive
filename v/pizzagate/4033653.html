<blockquote>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein and his accused madam Ghislaine Maxwell put his young victims on “ridiculous,” extreme diets to maintain their “prepubescent” look, accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre claimed.</p>
<p>“It was all organic — it was all like shaved salmon on a bed of pilaf or couscous and your vegetables,” Giuffre told a new podcast, “Broken: Seeking Justice.”</p>
<p>“It was never like carbs, you can’t just fill up, they wanted you to look a specific way,” she said, accusing Maxwell of being the one who would monitor them and punish any rule-breakers.</p>
<p>Giuffre said celebrity chef Adam Perry Lang — who used to work for Epstein in the early 2000s — bonded with her and would secretly make her late-night <strong>pizza</strong> treats that they would wash down with beer.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The podcast caught Giuffre trying to get in touch with Lang in the hopes he would dish on his time with Epstein — with the Australian-based accuser even going to his Hollywood restaurant, which is backed by Jimmy Kimmel and Joel McHale.</p>
<p>Giuffre said it was “heartbreaking” that the chef ignored her previous requests to discuss his knowledge about what she called the “most prolific sex trafficking ring of modern times.”</p>
<p>“He’s gone now, he can’t hurt us anymore,” she told Lang in a letter she read out on the podcast, telling him to “elevate yourself to the status of a hero.”</p>
<p>“You could help put together some of the missing pieces of my broken life,” she wrote. <strong>“Adam, don’t be an enabler, be a hero.”</strong></p>
<p>Giuffre insisted that <strong>“everybody who went into Jeffrey’s house knew what was going on.”</strong></p>
<p>“You couldn’t be [even] <strong>a pizza delivery boy</strong> and walk in Epstein’s houses and not know what was going on,” she said of “naked pictures everywhere, young girls everywhere.”</p>

<p>Prince Andrew is under fresh pressure to help with the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes after Epstein’s chef agreed to cooperate with the FBI.  Adam Perry Lang, 52, flew with Prince Andrew on Epstein’s private jet and often catered for the Prince while he worked for the paedophile <strong>between 1999 and 2003</strong>.  <strong>Lang was on two flights with Prince Andrew in February 1999 and in May 2000, according to court documents.</strong>  Sources told the Mirror: ‘The gloves are firmly off. <strong>Perry Lang holds information on what took place.</strong> ‘They will get as much detail as possible that will help shape any interview they may one day have with the Duke.’ The chef, who opened London’s Barbecoa restaurant with <strong>Jamie Oliver in 2010, volunteered to assist the FBI after Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked to Prince Andrew three times, wrote to him<strong>.  She pleaded with the chef: ‘Please don’t be an enabler. Be a hero to me’.  Lawyers representing Epstein’s victims said they hope that Lang’s cooperation ‘inspires other witnesses to come forward and help shed some light on Epstein’s dark scheme’.

<p>Is Celebrity Chef Adam Perry-Lang Saying Epstein Survivor is Lying?</p>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein chef Adam Perry-Lang claims he is helping law enforcement but also says he knows nothing of the dead pedophile’s sex abuse because he “spent my time in the kitchen.”</p>
<p>The Daily Beast ran this statement yesterday from Mr Perry-Lang, who is now one of Hollywood’s hottest chefs:</p>

<hr />
<p>Pizza, Pasta and Hot Dogs? Why hire a fat BBQ master to make skinny salmon salads and couscous? Was there also BBQing going on? More carnivorous meals prepared like that rumored of Red Scarf victim Anthony Bourdain?  It\'s entirely possible these food references are just that, and I am experiencing some suspicion from PG confirmation bias. A few more coincidences re: these celebrity chefs and we may be onto something far more disturbing though. Things that arouse this suspicion : </p>
<p>His interest in Knives </p>
<p>His connections to Jimmy Kimmel and Bomb Threat Arrest at his home </p>
<p>His Rib Room looks like a Kill Room</p>
<p>NYC, Hollywood, New Mexico, Little St James </p>
<p>His love of Hot Dogs aka Street Meat </p>
<p>etc...</p>
<p>If not code or spirit cooking, this is still an interesting example of CHEF involvement in elite networks, and an encouraging update from the Epstein case. What do you goats think? </p>

            Most likely Lang is a J and they will never betray their own. One of their holy books states you must lie to the Goyium to protect your own. Of course he is not going to work with the victims. These people never turn their backs on their own and will lie cheat and steal for their own. Beware.

            When searching the meaning behind : meat palace

             <p>
              "Doublemeat Palace" is the 12th episode of season 6 of the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

             Willow reports to Xander and Anya that the supervillains seem to have abandoned their basement lair. Meanwhile, Buffy, having found out that she is deeply in debt, gets a new job working at a fast food restaurant called Doublemeat Palace. She soon believes something strange is going on.
            </p>
            <p>
             Buffy is offered the Doublemeat Medley, a burger consisting of typical ingredients and layers of beef and chicken. She reluctantly takes a bite, then questions what the secret ingredient in the meat is, but gets no clear answer ("It's a meat process.").
            </p>
            <p>
             During her break, Buffy sneaks around in the back rooms, searching for the truth behind the secret ingredient, but is caught by Manny. At the counter, Buffy finds her friends have come by to visit her and she treats Xander to a Doublemeat Medley.
            </p>
            <p>
             The next day, with Gary not there to work, Buffy is assigned to the grill. As Timothy demonstrates the process, Buffy asks again about the secret ingredient, but still can't get an answer from anyone. Manny then assigns Buffy to a double shift because of the reduction of employees.
            </p>
            <p>
             Buffy watches the grinder grind meat, but discovers a human finger in the processed meat. Appalled at the idea of human meat being the secret ingredient, Buffy confronts Manny about it, but he doesn't agree with her suspicions. Buffy charges out into the dining area, attempting to stop all the patrons from eating while shouting that the meat is made of humans. The outburst gets her fired.
            </p>
            <p>
             Buffy brings the severed finger and a Doublemeat Medley to The Magic Box, but Xander eats the burger before Buffy explains her concerns. Willow arrives late, ready to begin researching, although she's still under Amy's gift spell and lacks control over her use of magic. Buffy leaves to investigate Doublemeat Palace after hours, while Willow uses chemistry to test a leftover piece of meat from the Doublemeat Medley.
            </p>

             Buffy breaks into the Palace and finds clues: blood and Manny's severed foot.
            </p>
            <p>
             While continuing to snoop, Buffy encounters the regular customer, "Wig Lady", without her wig. A demonic lamprey emerges from the lady's head and sprays a paralyzing liquid at Buffy. The lady advances on Buffy and talks about eating Doublemeat employees as the Slayer struggles to escape.

                During the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences panel discussion that occurred between seasons six and seven, Joss Whedon revealed that this episode was the first episode that caused sponsors to threaten to pull support due to the portrayal of the fast food industry. Buffy working at Doublemeat Palace "made the advertisers very twitchy"; as Whedon joked, "the most controversial thing we ever had on Buffy was a hamburger and chicken sandwich.
