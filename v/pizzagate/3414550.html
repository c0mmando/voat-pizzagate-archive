<blockquote>
<p>MIAMI: Royal Caribbean International will be the first in the hospitality industry to offer complimentary on-demand access to exclusive content from The Autism Channel onboard most of its ships. Starting in late October 2015, this new offering enhances the cruise line’s highly successful Autism Friendly program, designed to provide inclusive cruise vacation experiences for families living with autism and other developmental disabilities. </p>
<p>..“The Autism Channel is delighted that Royal Caribbean has chosen to make this valuable content available on many Royal Caribbean ships. For every one person on the autism spectrum there are six more persons directly impacted by that person. Complimentary access to The Autism Channel’s exclusive content will benefit many Royal Caribbean guests and bring more awareness to Autism,” said Jeffrey A. Kasky, president, The Autism Channel. </p>

<p>Royal Caribbean,you say?  Voat posts:</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3271685">Another \'suicide\', wife of pop artist Peter Max with connections to the Park West Foundation, partners of Michigan Department of Human Services and the Prince\'s Trust International</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peter Max is a famous pop artist who has worked with many famous people from the Beatles to Obama, to Prince Edward.. He is considered a very large influence in the Counter Culture movement of the Sixties and Seventies … these days his work can be found in Park West showrooms on all of the major cruise lines, including Royal Caribbean, Carnival and Norwegian </p>
<p>Park West is still aggressively selling Peter Max aboard the world’s cruise ships. Just before Christmas, the gallery had some of the best real estate on the Mariner of the Seas, a Royal Caribbean ship drifting through the mint-blue waters off Coco Cay in the Bahamas. </p>

            MIAMI: Royal Caribbean International will be the first in the hospitality industry to offer complimentary on-demand access to exclusive content from The Autism Channel onboard most of its ships. Starting in late October 2015, this new offering enhances the cruise line’s highly successful Autism Friendly program, designed to provide inclusive cruise vacation experiences for families living with autism and other developmental disabilities.
           </p>
           <p>
            ..“The Autism Channel is delighted that Royal Caribbean has chosen to make this valuable content available on many Royal Caribbean ships. For every one person on the autism spectrum there are six more persons directly impacted by that person. Complimentary access to The Autism Channel’s exclusive content will benefit many Royal Caribbean guests and bring more awareness to Autism,” said Jeffrey A. Kasky, president, The Autism Channel.

            Peter Max is a famous pop artist who has worked with many famous people from the Beatles to Obama, to Prince Edward.. He is considered a very large influence in the Counter Culture movement of the Sixties and Seventies … these days his work can be found in Park West showrooms on all of the major cruise lines, including Royal Caribbean, Carnival and Norwegian

           <p>
            Park West is still aggressively selling Peter Max aboard the world’s cruise ships. Just before Christmas, the gallery had some of the best real estate on the Mariner of the Seas, a Royal Caribbean ship drifting through the mint-blue waters off Coco Cay in the Bahamas.

           Note the reference to the Michigan Department of Human Services.  An important facet in the HARPA connections. Our other Voat posts on other Health and Human Services Departments will be highlighted in another post.  Also note:

            Blackwater was started up one year before 9/11......remember D Rumsfield announcing 2.2 trillion missing from dept of defense? US has decided to use mercenaries instead of military? No way blackwater was built by a so called Amway family fortune. This is way way too much for one family to do.http://businessnc.com/war-is-halecategory/?fbclid=IwAR0ah8aDt_xRqypD45rPshaNDDg5NllPzNHGeo1uXWrBM7tp7yjI8OXXnok

            The Trump Administration is considering a very disturbing proposal that would use Big Tech companies including Google, Amazon, and Apple to collect data on users who exhibit characteristics of mental illness that could lead to “violent behavior”.
           </p>
           <p>
            Naturally, a new federal agency will be created to implement this program. The push to create this new agency – called the Health Advanced Research Projects Agency or HARPA – began two years ago, reports The Washington Post..
           </p>
           <h1 id="md-trump-is-reportedly-a-big-fan-of-the-harpa-proposal.">
            Trump is reportedly a big fan of the HARPA proposal.
           </h1>
           <p>
            HARPA would be part of the Health and Human Services Department. Its director would be appointed by Trump, and the agency would have a separate budget, according to The Post. The agency would be modeled on another controversial federal agency – DARPA.
           </p>
           <h1 id="md-the-way-data-will-be-collected-for-the-project-is-very-troubling.">
            The way data will be collected for the project is very troubling.
           </h1>
           <p>
            The Post spoke to some people who have knowledge of the project. One of them is Geoffrey Ling, who is the lead scientific adviser on HARPA. Ling is also a founding director of DARPA’s Biological Technologies Office. He explained that the project will use “volunteer data” to identify “neurobehavioral signs” of “someone headed toward a violent explosive act”.
           </p>
           <p>
            ...Everybody would be a volunteer? What does Ling mean, exactly? The Post article does not clarify, but it does emphasize that the project would not collect an individual’s information without their permission. By “permission” do they mean that because users generally agree to allow companies like Google and Apple to share their private information when they accept terms and conditions, HARPA would have access to your private data whether you want them to or not? Is this some kind of “permission by proxy” scam?
           </p>
           <h1 id="md-harpa-is-another-sign-that-social-credit-systems-and-gun-confiscation-are-coming.">
            HARPA is another sign that social credit systems and gun confiscation are coming.
           </h1>
           <p>
            This sounds a lot like a component of a social credit system, doesn’t it? Eta Onrish described how this works and the role Big Tech plays in the article Forget 1984, We’re Facing a Brave New World
           </p>
           <p>
            Gun confiscation really is coming, and it doesn’t seem to be a partisan issue anymore.
           </p>
           <p>
            Red flag gun laws, the NRA being labeled a terrorist organization, the Trump Administration’s support of HARPA’s agenda, and presidential candidates openly admitting they will confiscate guns if elected are all signs that we are truly heading down a terrifying dystopian path.

             An Indiana couple is suing a Colorado adoption agency, claiming a teenage boy brought from China had an undisclosed history of sexual abuse that led to the rape of their two younger children. The civil lawsuit was filed against Chinese Children Adoption International (CCAI) on behalf of the couple and their two Chinese boys.

            Interestingly it is not far from Andros Island.  George Webb only a couple of days ago did a video about that island claiming that it is/was a CIA hangout.  The video has since been deleted: https:// conspiracydailyupdate.com/2019/09/05/sept-4-2019-epsteins-andros-island-long-time-cia-playground/
