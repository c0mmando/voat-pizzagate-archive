<h3>Incidents include a girl being given one dollar before being raped by an aid worker.</h3>
<p>Young boys and girls already revealed a decade ago that they were being abused and their families told how they were powerless to act, the International Development Committee heard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Corinna Csaky set out evidence from an investigation she carried out in 2008 into the abuse of children by humanitarian staff and peacekeepers.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The testimonies were part of a report, <em>No One To Turn To</em>, by Ms Csaky for <em>Save the Children</em>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Csaky said an advance copy was sent to the CEO of Oxfam and all major international (non-governmental organisations) NGOs, in 2008, two years before the earthquake abuse.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it is now claimed authorities did not do enough to act after 23 organisations were implicated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In the report it was claimed the majority of abuse allegations were made against troops associated with the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) \'particularly in Haiti and Côte d\'Ivoire\'.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A 14-year-old boy in Cote D\'Ivoire quoted in the report said workers at a peacekeeping camp would sometimes ask for girls his age.</p>
<p><em>Many girls were gang-raped:</em> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'Often it will be between eight and 10 men who will share two or three girls. They also use their mobile phones to film the girls.\'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Children and parents said they were unable to report the abuse. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'The people who are raping us and the people in the office are the same people,\' according to a young girl in Haiti.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1></h1>
<p><strong>Allegations of attacks by charity sector employees have been exposed since a scandal involving Oxfam in Haiti emerged.</strong></p>
<p>The charity\'s staff were deployed to the nation in 2010 after a devastating earthquake with as many as 53 aftershocks rocked the Caribbean country.</p>
<p>In the wake of the disaster aid workers stayed in villas as they helped piece the nation back together. But years later it emerged many had used prostitutes during their work there.</p>
<p>There were accusations many girls were underage - although the charity insists this was never proven.</p>
<p>Penny Lawrence, resigned as Deputy Chief Executive of the charity saying she took \'full responsibility\' for the behaviour of staff in Chad and Haiti \'that we failed to adequately act upon\'.</p>
<p>Since then, some 1,100 complaints over safeguarding in aid agencies have been made, according to the Charity Commission. </p>
<p>They included a young boy in Haiti who said a homeless girl was taken to a man who worked for an aid organisation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'He gave her one American dollar and the little girl was happy to see the money,\' the boy said.</p>
<p>\'It was two in the morning. The man took her and raped her. In the morning the little girl could not walk.\'</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>A father in Cote d\'Ivoire said: \'They don\'t even hide what they are doing.\'</strong></p>

            there are even babies born to girls old enough to be ovulating but still.preteens as a result of this widespread abuse.  One can only imagine  the dismal life for the young mother and child. A doctor friend of mine served in Africa and described the horrible internal physical damage to  girls when they go thru childbirth  while still so young and small including severe pelvic prolapse.  ( I'lll let you the reader look that up.)

            How did humans degenerate to this level.  Wouldn't it be wonderful if Trump made a big stink.of this. Maybe we should bombard the White House with demands for him  to take some scalps.

            UPVOAT!  What a discovery and it is covered by the DM on top of it all.  I and others have done posts on the raping of these poor children and it is about time these Peacekeeper Soldier Rapists finally get called out .  After being discovered, they are admonished and sent back to their home country but nothing is ever done.  Then to make matters worse, they are sent right back to commit those heinous crimes all over again.  A virtual Merry Go Round that is not a happy ride for those Children.

India proudly proclaim the number of soldiers they send on UN peacekeeping missions ..
Maybe the UN should be asked if they have statstical data showing the numbers sent home and which country theyre from

               In the dark they dont follow rules...
But in the light they have to...its not their system..they just take advantage of the chessboard because we are blind to the rules..
And one of the main rules is that they have a lien on our names until we reduce debt ..
I have emailed the US treasury and they have agreed to take anyones monies ...doesnt have.. to be dollars...to.reduce their debt ...
How did i get a reply ? ..they have to follow rules in the public.forum...They could have ignored my instructions...
In writing and in public record they have to acknowledge our status as sureties..
..the other option is to keep trying to win the debt game with lien on ur name ...this is impossible and futile...and they know it more than u..this is why they feed agents to provocate the public..

               I really do not think that is a reliable understanding of the situation because of the systemic rape that tribes do over there(and other). This, to me, is a planned orchestration event. Are the so called charity workers responsible? Yes, and so is the funder.

              I would imagine the larger the country............  Yes, India, maybe Australia.  Do we send any there and are our soldiers doing any of this?  I have not looked into that part of it.   Yes, they should provide such information.  We should demand it.  Trump must demand it but also work on getting us out ASAP.  Here is what I have found.
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/11898603/UN-peacekeepers-How-many-personnel-does-each-country-contribute.html">

              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              The US and Russia, meanwhile, only contribute around 70 personnel each, and the UK contributes a further 289.   UK that small country.  More than US and Russia combined. WOW.
             </p>
             <p>
              China's new contribution will make it one of the largest presences in the peacekeeping force.  It is the only UN Security Council member to be in the top 25 countries for the number of peacekeepers.
             </p>
             <p>
              France is the next largest contibutor with just over 900 personnel.   WHAT?
             </p>
             <p>
              Bangladesh, Ethiopa, India, Pakistan and Rwanda currently contribute the largest number of peacekeepers - having a share of 36 per cent of the UN's force.

              Peacekeeping soldiers, who come from dozens of countries, usually are sent home when they face sexual abuse allegations, as required under U.N. rules. That policy has become a shield for alleged abusers, according to child advocates.

The UN is US ..
U can change the UN by changing the US ...turn it into ur debtor ...

                I get it.  But I don't know how to do this on my own.  This must be a concerted effort.  We must do this en mass.  Any one person trying to do this will be Locked In A Brigg.

                 Ive emailed.the US treasury thier debt reduction department ..and they have replied in the positive ..
They accept.anyones money ...on the planet to reduce debt ...
I have to confirm with them whether once they recieved my credit...that they will acknowledge mynsurety rights over them..and therefore discharge any charge ...including court charges in my name..
I have to. email the same to.the commissions of debt reductiin in the crown treasury ..to see where else i have remedy ..Is the crown part of it ..
Do i have to.pay ceasers what is ceasers and god what is god...
Ceaser : its accountant is US 
God : it accountant is the crown temple
                </p>
                <p>
                 But ..if one does it as a group...would be effective...
But i emailed them without fear ...its fear thatvgive them energy..
Remember the storh of dorothy..door to god
She had the strawman ..ur name...
She had the tin man ....ur SSN 
..and the lion ...courage
..
Knowing that We already  do the same when we deposit money in a bank..
The bqnk did not bite our hewd off when we instructed them to accept our credits as a loan to their debt system..
                </p>
                <p>
                 Instead of the bank ure approaching ur own bank and treasury ..instead of surrendering ur self and revistering everything to the debt side of the game ur surrendering everything to ur own treasury ..
The effect is that as u agree.to.work.for peace and not war..they dont need to place a lien on ur name ..to ensure performance inside the war game ..
They can only imprison u when they have a lien on ur name ..that exists only when u decide to use their debt game and their debt instruments ..bank cheques and bank notes inside the war game ...
When theey agree to discharge all charges ...the lien on ur name  vanishes ..
                </p>
                <p>
                 If u are afraid ...just send an email in a vpn account mail...i emailed them from outisde US..
..
Anyway i'll keep u up to date as to my moves.
..
If i can explain the maths that might give u confidence..
..its a thought experiment ...imagine everyone on the planet did this ..the US debt would be zeroed out ...
No one has any money in the banks ...banks have to shut down...but u have agreement that the US will discharge any charge..
So now ur hungry..banks have shut down..
U go to the bakers and order bread .butter etc .he charges u 10 dollars ..u buy on credit 
U send the bill to the US treasury..the US has to go into debt 10 dollars to discharge ur bill..
The baker then takes that 10dollars and pays the US to reduce debt ..
Whats the debt of the US ..still zero..
But u got ur bread and the baker got ur business..in turn he can buy a bike for his son..
It.costs 100 dollars...this is discharged by the US the bicycle seller ...gets this 100 dollar...and uses it to reduce the 100dollars the US is in debt to...
So now we dont need banks ..we never did...its all a magic trick..the bankers know about ..This is why they released the movie wozard of oz at the eve of the world bankruptcy ..ie World War ii..
They left us the solution ..as the wizard explains to dorothy afelter she kills the witch..
"U mean u liquidated her , very resourceful"...
..
We run the bwnking system ..the so called bankers are just our score keepers...in the war side of th game which they get us to choose by their education and media systems 
We can ..unchoose ..ie  depositiin our selves  .....unreside fom the war game ..and side for the peace game where we directly decide as a community or individually what is best for us ..and place the credit for that particular goods and services..
At the moment we know delocalised  organic food is good for us..but the banking system has made that expensive inside the war game..
If the US treasury funds ur local organic farm ..as a group or individually ...u will both feed urself ..the community etc ..
Maybe as a grouo u can start with homescholling ..take a few hours of tuition ..send the credit to the US ..obviously after confriming they will aknoweldge ur surety rights over the debtor ie the US and its corporations and courts

                  Please keep me posted.  I am extremely curious.  I agree that there were signs in the wizard movie.  Oh how clever "liquidating" the witch has she proceeded to melt. 
I have not such money.  To pay off my debt would take much more than I have.  I also agree that they have created a wicked nasty trick to play on us.  Also the mortgage of homes is another nasty dirty trick when the same home is sold over and over and over for huge amounts.  The circle never ends. And all the while we are caught up in it.

                   Know its.not ur debt that is removed .that fictional.debt is only inside the game of the war..
Remmber its ur instructiin and promissory note  that created the credit used to buy ur house..u basicallynacted like a mini govt ...instead of a treasury bill u created a mortgage contract ..with the house ie property as security..
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   When u reduce the US debt ...u will.put back the obligation they have onto thier heads to discharge all ur debts ...past present and future...
Its difficult to understand since we have been driving the car in reverse....
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   ..the charge on ur house will be removed ..once u agree with the US that u will...take any credit or assets.to.remove the US debt ..in.return for them.acknowledging hthat they will.remove all charges aginst ur name ..the mortgage debt that will be removed ..since the US will have to in writing acknowledge that u have been all along been the surety to creating all the credit in ur life..for the runnig of thr US ...
U stood.as surety inside the war game.to.create.the credit for the US bank (utube : money as debt)
The bank is a US sub corporation under its Acts...
Even ur name ..walmart ...ben and jerries are all registered corporatiins ..all created by some Act ...all.therefore sub US corporations..
U can start off.with say 10 dollars...to the US treasury ..u can do it as a group ..but make sure theyngive it in writing by email.that they acknowledge ur surety rights over them and will.discharge all bills and charges including ur mortgage contract ..
They have to acknowledge it since u already are surety to the credit u created for the bank...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I am.gonna.do.it.with less.than a few dollars.a month ..if they agree in the first email....then im out of the game...
As.for.placing a.charge on others...i will plsce.a.charge on an insursnce company in another country...for forging.my signature...all that money will go to the US treasury...
Ur co tract with the US started with ur birth certificate...its a co tract to take care of the name and its beneficiary...
U r apllying reversionary interest on them
Google.: reversionary interest..
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   U already surrender ur credit.to the US dont u?
Ure deposits.at the US banking system.is actually a loan to them..They then set up. As trustee to the account ..look closely at the dotted.line on ur check book..
Its not a.dotted line ...tell.me.what it says ?
One u understand what it says u will realise that when u get a bill.mit is not u whonis paying ..its the bank ...since u decreased its debt to u ...u call it debit ...when u debit the bank account u are decreasing the banks debt to u...unthen become surety to the banknat that instance ..and exercise ur surety rights over the US who then credits the shopkeeper..
The US discharged ur bill through the bank..
When u deposit. Ur credit u are actallynloaning to the war machine..
When u positiin ur credit to reduce debt ..u will feed the peafe machine and starve the war machine..even if it is a.few.dollars to.start with..
Whether it is on the war side or peace side ..u are acknowleged as.surety..social surety or security account ..
Can u see the dotted line ?
All in time

                   Those pedo freaks know their time is up ....
The prince of thieves is about to Re turn..
Christ is just a double book entry system that accounts for this credit system ..it can be run for War ..or Peace...
They want to keep is sinning ..Sin is just a recording and depositiining of  our inside the war game ..
The original sin comes about when ur mother does labour to bring u into the earth vessel..the name is an account she creates with a name tagged to it..to record ur usage of that earth vessel which she actually laboured to create..u cannot pay her back ..hence they habe crrated a double book entry system called Xhrist ...savings account in Xhrist with u as the eventual beneficiary...but they program u as trustee ..holder of the birth certificate to loan it into a war game ...when u do that u become an enemy of ur own state ..ie enemy of the State ..and autimatically enter and fund the war at the same.time...
When u exit and defund it ..it is the equivalrnt of being at peace with ur estate ie ur name ..since u have decreased the debt u owe to ur mother ..
..there is a lot to read ...i am not completely knowledgeable in this topic..but now enough to see the trick ..that they themselves reveal to us..
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   ..if u notice in the movie In Time ..the machines that make the rich wealthy are xreated in great volimes by the poor in factories...
Ur deposit alllows the bank to keep ot as margin for the credit u create for the banking system and the US treasury...
The US goes into debt by stealing ur future labour credits..and giving it to the arms industry ..big pharma ...which then deposit it into Big banks ..that then buy ur mortgage contract from the bank that also stole ur future labour to create the credit to buy ur house..
Is is stealing ...if its already stolen

                   Once u realise that we dont own anything ...everythung is public property as everything is registered ..ur car ..ur house ..ur children..ur credit u will realise is not urs .. U will then see the bigger picture that all we arr are trustees..with the master trustee the US...our decision as trustees to loan into the war turns the master trustee into a war corpiration..when we as trustees reposition the credit on the Asset side of the US treasury and reduce its debt ..it will respond..we fear we lose everything if that happens...when we already have made and act out the decision of surrendering everyrhing by registering everything including our registered name to the war side ..
Fear then is sold back to us to keep us in the game of debt ..and we buy into it from a lack of knowledge..

                    Wow.  yeah I get that we don't own anything really and that the bank owns it but they reduce their debt with our signature because their name is on the line, is that correct?  If not, I am at a loss.

                      I will watch it, but I am not in the accountant mode.  I am horrible at math when it is beyond basics. They have us over a barrel, unless we figure out how to beat them at their game.  You have explained it, but I am only one person.  We need others to join in.

                       I know it is difficult at first ..Check out utube videos on basicc double book entry..
The maths is as simple as using a balnce ..
In double book entry system ..because therr is an asset and liabilty column ..they play with two balances..
Every book entry has a left hand entry ie debit 
with a compulsory credit entry ...it could be on the liability side ..which they make us hold...or u can take the credit...and make a credit entry for the reduction of the debit entry on the asset side..
ie ..they will have to reduce the debt by taking a treasury bill held by the international banksters..
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I want the US treasury to discharge my bills instead of the banking system...
Its a simple trick..they dont us to try..
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       The maths is simple as balancing...its not even addition or subtraction ..its just placing what they owe u ...ie ur labour credits in the bank ..and replacing it on the side of the US treasury ....
...
The option is available to everyone ..individually or as a collective..u can run businesses..
U can charge the government officers..
..
Its all about confidence in seeing we do the same at our banks ..we just run it inreverse to access our right to instruct the US to discharge our bills or collect on any charges we create ...
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       A good video is the modern money theory videos on utube ..
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Build ur confidence on this simple magic trick..
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       This is the only way out ...
I'll keep u up todate ..

                     Everything is held in common...Bank also.dont own it..they r just scorekeepers...for.us..the collective.us..
Its like.ur hand ...the palm.of ur hand is like the collective...but it can act through ur fingers ...which is analogous to each individual...the individual.acts by being connected to the palm or the collective body..
Thenaccountant or scorekeeper of the thencollective.is the govt and its bank the treasury  ...and the individuals scorekeepr is the banks...under the govt bank act ...
Another analogy is a stage show ...
There are five  characters 
..the producer...each individual..ie the fingers
the stage ..the collective nation 
The directors...govt..its sub corporation..like banks and courts ...theynalso havr their game separate.game show to.run their book keeping ..its called Acts
The actors: to play this war game.they at every instant of a debt created ..they ask us to act for.them ..to take part in their Acts..
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     When u are billed for the cup of coffee..it is.not u that is biller its the capitalised name ...ie a registered entity of the war ...so the debt for the coffee is held by the govt entity..
They use u (as u are the producer ..all energy comes from the flesh and blood u) to stand in or undrr stand ..stand undrr ...as surety to this debt ..they want u to discharge the charrgr they.are holding , albeit an entity that sounds like ur name ..it is Capitalised ..its their own company but with u as its producer..
( constitutor ..means someone who shifts debt ontona third party ..which is the surety ..the producer of the game show of debt)
..and u then produce a Fed note ( at the instance the system does not want to know how u got it ..it just wwnts some instrument to discharge the debt intonthe future..a promissory note with someone guaranteeing it ie standing surety to it.. which is the govt ..its writtennon the fed note...but eventually u r the surety tonthe govt and its acts...
..or u use the banking Act ..and u act as a banker..and the Bank ur scorekeepr..
U take.out a cheque or debit card ..and tell the ssytem i am.going to debit or reduce ur liability to the name on the cheque...because u reduced the debt the bank owes to u ..u are awarded surety rights ..and the bank discharges it by debiting the JOHN doe account and crediting starbucks...
Or if u use a credit card under a credit card agreement ..tye name JOHN  DOE create credit for the bank ..and stand under the charge for the following months..
Have u checked the dotted line ..on the cheque book ..it actaully spells.out authorised signatory..
U are the author of the script ..as well as the scrip that forwards the script in time..
For: eg ..drinking a cup of coffee inside the war game.is an event in ur life ..they turn it into a script and to run the accounting of it..they ask the priducer of the show ie u ..to stand under the scrip ie discharging instrument ..
Each event where u use energy..has an accounting act or book keeping act associated with it..
.
So u got it right ...the scorekeeping is thier business not ours..but as they need our permision to even run their business as directors they need our consent given as a signature..
U are running a company ...and u have an accounting department ..
They want u to run the accounting department as well..for each event that creates a charge..
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     ...we r in total.control ..but we are programmed daybin day out to run the accounting department based on war ..which is individually created by us warring against our own estate...ie our refusal to reduce our debt to our mother..collectively they call it War ....our increasing our debt to our own estate..gives them legitamacy via our actions ...to run the accountingndepartment of the war game show..and we consent tonthat as well..
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     We can reduce debt...at the US treasury..which is like the worlds collective mothers account keeper..
Whrn u reduce the debt of the prime war corporation ..what happens to the fuel that runs the war game show ..it reduces eventually but only ehen we become the change..
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     In law when one capitalises the name ..the capitalsied name is a separate entity..
Google : what is namium
Then look up
Capitus dimintio minima ..and then capitus dimintio maxima..
A separate entity with lower rights is created
                    </p>

                    <p>
                     We can choose a play the game.of peace..
Either way they r obligated as accountants to discharge all our bills..we can get them to do it on the peace side where we have direct access and direct control of the US treasury..rather than rely on scraps inside the war game..
 I know its a lot to take in ..but i hope the stage show analogy helps..
U can further its explanation by seeing the war game show stage as a navy war shipping game..eith citizenShips..the actors..of the merchant game ..being given permission by the directors of the game show to trade in their war zone..given militiary posts or postal a.dresses...residing our minds insside this fictional war game ..that is our own crration and we r the fuel or liquidity for it...take away the liquidity for the war ..it ends ..all the Acts theu hide behind ...vanish ..
Any how one looks at it ..it summarises to this point

                    <p>
                     Teduxe debt and turn the US treasury into ur debtor servant ...
The servant has to discharge all charges ..including court charges..
They will come.begging to u to create charges payable tonthe US treasury...for the running of the peace game..including charges against these pedo freaks
