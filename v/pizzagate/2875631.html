            Just saw it.   The guy was in the hospital because drugs that were controlling the thoughts/urges almost killed him.   The Drs told him he had to cut them off and he admitted to why he needed them.
           </p>
           <p>
            He then was released from the hospital but re-admitted soon after as he tried to destroy his own testicles with a knife.   Drs could not castrate him because the loss of testosterone would have killed him before he healed.
           </p>
           <p>
            So he is faced with going through months of phych evals before castration can be medically cleared.   He escapes from his room and goes out to the street and commits suicide by stepping in front of a truck.
           </p>

            I like this show, will keep watching as I don't see this as any kind of nod to pedos being the norm.

            There was a British TV series out earlier this year called
            <em>
             Save Me
            </em>
            (aka
            <em>
             Gone
            </em>
            ) about a man, Nelson "Nelly" Rowe, searching for his estranged, teenage daughter who has been kidnapped by child sex traffickers.  Helping him in his search is his friend, Fabio "Melon" Melonzola, a convicted child rapist.  "Melon", however, is a 'good' child rapist, because not only did he 'love' his victim, the child 'consented' to have sex and was only later convinced she had been wronged by overzealous parents and police.  The paedophile propaganda is blatantly obvious; there are good and bad child rapists and children can consent to have sex with an adult, damn those moral busybody police and parents!

            Every fucking week they push NPC shit. 
Last week it was vaccines and diversity issues.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first 5 or 6 episode of season 1 had very little of that but then suddenly every episode became an SJW circle jerk.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's like they know they'll never build a decent audience pushing that shit these days so they avoid it until you are hooked.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe the writers are getting cleverer about how the push this radical far left ideology. I started watching cause I loved Dr. House MD and I never remembered house being far left bullshit.
           </p>

            I am in Australia so I usually see it after work on Tuesday my time. Doubt I'll be able to stomach this one.

             You're right. I liked this show the first season. It's gotten much more propagandistic this season. What irks the crap out of me is the Jewish neurosurgeon mentor doc. Hero in Season 1, now super victim. Totally cringey.

              I fucking watched it. For research purposes you'll understand.. Fuck sake it nearly sickened me. The amount of sympathy shown for this degenerate piece of shit is unbelievable. They did everything in their power to make him seem like a fucking hero for not acting on his impulse to fuck children. Written by the same people who produce 'Salon' it seems.
             </p>
             <p>
              I doubt they'd have so much sympathy for a guy who fantasized about raping women but never acts on it. He just gets off on the thoughts of it. Ah but since he doesn't act on his impulses he must be some sort of hero.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't act on my impulse to murder every NPC i encounter. Does that make me a hero?
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't act on my impulse to shove their "let them in" signs violently up their arses. Does that make me a hero?
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't act on my impulse to take my cock out down the pub and do the helicopter to attract mates. Surely that makes me a hero.
             </p>
             <p>
              If i do it side by side with a mate we can do the chinook. We're both heros in this instance for resisting the urge.

                Thanks for all you do. I've lurked PG for years. In fact thats how i found voat. It became my last refuge to maintain my sanity. You guys are amazing and i honestly can never thank you enough. Back when i had nobody in my life who i could classify as 'awake' or 'waking' i began doubting my own sanity until i found voat and all you old goats.
               </p>
               <p>
                You reaffirmed to me that i was a thinking creature just like you guys. It didn't take long to recognize the fact that real conversations happen here. I never looked back. Today i have more woke people in my life than NPCs and much of that is special thanks to voat. Helped me hone my debating skills.
               </p>
               <p>
                This past year i've seen many an old friend come calling. Rekindled old friendships and even repaired relationships with family. They changed i didn't. They woke up and joined us. I refused to go back to sleep to rejoin them. I had faith they'd come round in the end and i was willing to lose them if they didn't. And they didn't for years. I doubt you guys will every truly know how many people like me you have helped. So i'm only delighted to have gotten a laugh out of you.

            Do what thou wilst.     Sick.  So they can brainwash themselves into believing they do no wrong.  What will they use for the fix?  Some fake operation that they will charge big bucks for?  The problem is that it won't fix anything and when they keep raping Children, what will they do then.  Fudge the numbers?
