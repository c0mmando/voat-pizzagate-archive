<p>David Copperfield Accused of Drugging, Assaulting 17-Year-Old Model in 1988 (Exclusive)
&quot;The FBI investigated Copperfield for two years and even raided Copperfield’s Las Vegas warehouse. The case was eventually closed with no official explanation, and Carroll dropped a civil lawsuit against Copperfield.&quot;</p>
<p>What?!? FBI raid?</p>
<p>CDAN about Copperfield:

<p>So the case just dissapeared? What did the FBI do with the 2$million cash and computer items that were seized?
<a href="https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/69078">https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/69078</a></p>
<p>We know about corruption at the FBI through our investigations... FBI raided franklin credit union and knew exactly what Lawrence E King was doing and they did nothing. Also in Omaha, fbi investigators threatened the kids who were abused by King and associates and got them to recant their stories. Evidence of FBI involvement and coverup is detailed in The Franklin Scandal by Nick Bryant.</p>
<p>FBI was involved in the case and plea deal for Epstein. The Florida police investigation generated enough evidence to lock Epstein away for life but the FBI confiscated it and gave him a plea deal. 
Info in Epsteins plea deal:

<p>Other people are just now walking up to the crimes of the FBI... the missing texts and #releasethememo. Now is a good time to let everyone know exactly what the FBI is capable of and what we already know they have been a part of.</p>

            Hey guys i think i have an idea. And all we need to do is pull a "white rabbit" out of a hat. All so interesting that this has CIA/FBI hands all over this and lawyers in this too. And i think DOJ too is in this because well lawyers and all i think. And well yeah. I think. I don't even know what the DOJ's advertised purpose even is.

            Epstein linked to Trump, Weinstein, Copperfield, and weird lawyer represented Weinstein, Epstein victim, And represents Strozk. And Alex Acosta linked to Trump and pizzagate and Epstein. John Mulholland Linked to david copperfield's warehouse. Again Paddock maybe linked to all of this. This shit is weird bros.

             This whole secret society "big reveal" has been a funny stunt. All those politicians at the Whitehouse are Masons. I bet they are snickering and having a good laugh pretending like they suddenly discovered a secret society.

            Indirect CIA/MK Ultra connection to David Copperfield's warehouse that the FBI raided:
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            The warehouse contains a collection called the “Mulholland Library of Conjuring and the Allied Arts,” which was named for CIA agent, MK Ultra co-creator, and stage magician John Mulholland, whose collections make up a great part of the library.
           </p>
           <p>
            David Copperfield purchased the "Mulholland Library" in 1991 for $2.2 million and moved the items from Los Angeles to the warehouse in Las Vegas.

             Gottlieb knew how to mix the potions.

            David Copperfield was also named in Epstein court documents in 2011:
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Paragraph 74:
            </p>
            <p>
             Epstein's housekeeper and one of the only witnesses who did not appear for deposition with an Epstein bought attorney,
             <strong>
              Alfredo Rodriguez,
             </strong>
             testified that David Copperfield was a guest at Epstein's house on several occasions. His name also appears frequently in the message pads confiscated from Epstein's house. It has been publicly reported that Copperfield himself has had allegations of sexual misconduct made against him by women claiming he sexually abused them, and one of Epstein's sexual assault victims also alleged that Copperfield had touched her in an improper sexual way while she was at Epstein's house.

As more people are awakened, now recognizing that the FBI might NOT be the 'good guy's, an opportunity exists to overturn and imprison these corrupt motherfuckers.
Liberal/Conservative/Independent leaning people are ALL united in loathing child exploitation and will join in this effort.

             Trump also nominated Alex Acosta for Labor Secretary. Acosta is the U.S. Attorney that gave Epstein his sweetheart deal when he got busted for child trafficking.

              In terms of the "sweetheart" deal, I did read an article about this, where it actually didnt appear as if Acosta was happy with all of this.  It looked like Epsteins attorneys ran Acosta ragged, and there were over 150 motions or changes.  It looked to me like they just beat him down, and it got so ridiculous, that there wasnt much more Acosta could do, so he settled on a fairly low charge, but was pissed.  I cant find the article now, but I remember that the amount of changes/appeals/revisions/meetings looked absurd.

               Yeah, cause not voting for either of them was so effective in keeping them both out. A lot of people voted for Trump in the hopes that he would be, either intentionally or not, a wrecking ball.

                I don't mind him keeping the facade up for a while. At least he has tore into the media. He seems to be slowly taking away liberties though, that's where I draw the line.

             <em>
              In 2006, the famed magician bought the 100-acre island of Musha Cay and its surrounding chain for $50 million, and with $40 million and five years of remodeling, made it into what he’s dubbed “the most magical vacation destination in the world.” Copperfield found the island after apparently drawing crisscrossing lines between Easter Island and Stonehenge, and the Pyramid of Giza and the Pyramid of the Sun in the Yucatan, and determining the exact spot at which the two intersected. The main resort island is actually one of 11 islands, all owned by the illusionist, in what’s been named Copperfield Bay. The others boast names like Forbidden Island, Enchanted Island, Secret Cay, and Imagine Island—incorporating 40 secluded beaches in all.

              A Seattle woman has accused magician David Copperfield of luring her to his remote private island in the Caribbean, raping her repeatedly, and threatening to kill her if she told anyone. Her complaint reads like a horrifying pulp novel.
             </li>
             <li>
              The accuser says she attended a Copperfield show in Kennewick, Wash., two years ago and was pulled from the crowd to participate in the act. After the show, Copperfield's assistant told her to stick around to meet the magician. She was ushered backstage, where her picture was taken with Copperfield and she was asked her to fill out a questionnaire. Copperfield's assistant explained that Copperfield owned a private island and a resort, and often had "promotional work" for models to appear in brochures he produced. Copperfield called her seven months later and invited her to attend a "promotional opportunity" on the island. The woman's complaint says she was told there would be other guests on the island, and that she couldn't bring her boyfriend because there wouldn't be room for him.

            <ul>
             <li>
              she walked to the beach to try to find a way off the island, but Copperfield tracked her down.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             <a href="http://images.gawker.com/18k4ix67n3apspng/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_470.png">
              This is just a taste of what you'll get if you tell anyone
             </a>
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              After that alleged assault, the woman says she went to take a shower, and Copperfield came after her again
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             All in all, the victim says, she spent three days and two nights trapped with Copperfield on the island. When she returned to Seattle, the complaint says, she went "directly" to the sexual trauma center at Harborview Hospital and filed a complaint with the Seattle Police Department. The Seattle cops called in the FBI because the alleged rapes took place outside the U.S., and the Seattle Times says the U.S. Attorney's office is deciding whether to file criminal charges against Copperfield.
            </p>
            <p>
             For his part, the illusionist has released a statement through his attorneys calling the victim a liar and saying that while on the island, "she sun-tanned in her bikini listening to her IPod, jet-skied with island visitors, had playful conversations with guests, and swam on island beaches, day after day."

            When looking into this stuff I found a weird connection....
           </p>
           <p>
            Lawyer David Boies
           </p>
           <p>
            He is currently rumored to be representing Peter Strzok, a claim he's denying.

           </p>
           <p>
            And he has previosly represented Harvey Weinstein and an Epstein victim. Lots of weird connections.

              Right before Flynn pleaded guilty and starting cooperating with the Special Counsel, his lawyer stopped sharing information with trump's lawyers.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Michael Flynn’s lawyers recently informed President Donald Trump’s legal team that they are not able to discuss the investigation by the special counsel anymore, four people involved with the case told The New York Times.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Three folks fired by Trump are sharing a lawyer.

               https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/25/mueller-russia-investigation-bannon-lawyer-juggles-clients-367521
              </a>
              Bannon is represented by William Burck, a veteran attorney and former federal prosecutor who helped send Martha Stewart to jail and who also counsels two other Trump insiders of interest to Mueller: former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House counsel Don McGahn.

             <p>
              Is there any reason to doubt this?  It's an on the record denial.   If Strzok needs a lawyer, that will be public info pretty quickly.
