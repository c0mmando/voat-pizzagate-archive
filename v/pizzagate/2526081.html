<p>Okay, this is the follow up to Part I. Stopped at the part we found out Mary Hiltbrand is now sober. But there\'s way more diabolical stuff in that link: </p>

<p>IF YOU DIDN’T KNOW THAT Agnes Nixon’s two most famous soap operas are set along the Main Line, you’re not alone. Their creator is downright cagey on the point, deflecting inquiries about whom certain characters are based on and where, exactly, the fictional towns of Llanview and Pine Valley (All My Children’s locale) are supposed to be located. “Pine Valley is the combination of Pine Cottage [the name of her home in Rosemont] and the Delaware Valley,” she says. “Llanview I just made up. Neither was particularly inspired. The truth is, I didn’t have time to think of anything else.”</p>
<p>“Llanview is Rosemont,” counters Erika Slezak, who for 35 years has played Victoria Lord, the stiff-upper-lipped matriarch of One Life’s most prominent family. </p>
<p>The Main Line has also inspired its share of over-the-top plot twists. Nixon recalls a story she heard about a fancy cocktail party at the home of a famed Main Line hostess; the doorbell rang, and the hostess — who had previously been the husband’s secretary — opened the door to find a young woman on the front steps. The woman whispered, “Mother.”</p>
<p>“I told you never to come here!” the hostess hissed. Nixon flipped the exchange into Phillip Brent’s discovery that his aunt was actually his mother on All My Children.</p>
<p>Agnes Nixon’s home, either once part of or adjacent to Mary Cassatt’s family estate (no one knows for sure because the land records burned in a fire), sits not far from the border of Bryn Mawr. And like its mistress, it is understated, elegant, and divided into distinct parts. Sprawling and gorgeous in that Old Money way, it oozes refinement but isn’t ostentatious ...  Looking around as we sit by a crackling fireplace (one of seven in the house), I feel a strange sense of déjà vu, as if I’ve seen this living room before. Then it hits me that I have: It’s almost an exact replica of the drawing room of All My Children’s Cortland Manor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Summed up: Agnes Nixon did not always write fiction. She took real life events and spun them into fantasy. Would this help get a handle on the rabbit hole? Having never watched any of these soaps, I couldn\'t tell you. I\'m not ready to invest fifty years of my life watching reruns to find out plot lines. But if one were an aficionado, yes, you might be able to figure out who she was really talking about. And further, was there an element of blackmail involved? While not stated, you can imagine that she could hold some very privileged people hostage by threatening to expose secrets this way. I\'m not saying that happened, but I am saying it COULD have happened. Especially since pizzagate involves blackmail. But now ... onto Gaelen. </p>
<p>There is a Galen in the Hiltbrant household. It\'s spelled \'G-a-l-e-n\'. Here\'s her Linked In page: </p>

<p>No comment there. But just because she posts pics eating pizza, and goes to school in the sex tourist trade capital of the world, it doesn\'t mean she hangs out with whores or something ... </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/62uhXNt">https://imgur.com/a/62uhXNt</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I\'m afraid it does. If you\'ll notice on that Linked In page that she worked for something called the Carbon War Room. That\'s Richard \'\'Virgin\'\' Branson\'s little group.  Here\'s the story: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://blogs.commons.georgetown.edu/phil-108-spring2013-grh24/2013/03/30/sir-richard-branson-2/">https://blogs.commons.georgetown.edu/phil-108-spring2013-grh24/2013/03/30/sir-richard-branson-2/</a></p>
<p>I thought that this would be a fun picture to share since our guest speaker Brad Schallert from the World Wildlife Fund gave Sir Richard Branson and the NGO he founded in DC, the Carbon War Room, a shout out during our most recent class. I interned for the CWR last school year and had the opportunity to sit in on a meeting with Richard Branson in March 2012.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, well, of course, EVERY girl gets to sit in on a meeting with SIR Richard Branson and I\'m sure he poses with anybody who asks! So WTH are you making a big deal out of it? </p>
<p>So the question remains does the name Galen signify anything? And why was that little boy being raised by something much worse than wolves was called Gaelen? Coincidence? Not a coincidence? The reason I\'m asking is because you know that article I started out posting? The one in Part I that announces the opening of Mary Nixon\'s New Leaf hangout for teens? Oh, how did they describe it again? </p>
<p><a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/local/20120721_Main_Line_teens_get_a_New_Leaf_to_hang_out.html">http://www.philly.com/philly/news/local/20120721_Main_Line_teens_get_a_New_Leaf_to_hang_out.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Main Line teens get a New Leaf to hang out
Updated: July 21, 2012 — 3:01 AM EDT </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yup, just a place to hang out. Well, look at it now: Mary Nixon Hiltbrand is now leasing the space and, well, wait until you read what happened to the New Leaf Club! </p>
<blockquote>
<h1>Center for Families takes over New Leaf Club HQ, plans new community center</h1>
<p>ANEU’s not the only western biz heading east. Only a year old, the non-profit Center for Families (CFF) in Malvern is expanding to a second location in Rosemont, taking over the New Leaf Club next to the new ANEU.</p>
<p>After five years, New Leaf is turning over a new leaf. It will operate out of offices in Bala Cynwyd.</p>
<p>“We’re getting out of the building and personnel business but our mission is the same,” says New Leaf Club founder Mary Nixon, who owns the building and leases to ANEU and to CFF.</p>
<p>Since its founding, scores of youth and families struggling with addiction, mental health issues have found kinship, information and support at New Leaf.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>WTF? I thought it was a place for kids to hang out? What\'s this with addiction and mental health issues?!!! Does she have any degrees? I don\'t see a Dr. anywhere, but there\'s more: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nixon says the shift away from bricks and mortar will likely mean a more intense focus on New Leaf’s uplifting arts and entertainment programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arts and entertainment? I thought the article just said they were focusing on mental health/addiction issues? Which is it?</p>
<p>Support groups that began under the auspices of New Leaf are still meeting upstairs at the Rosemont facility. The first floor remains closed for renovations. CFF hopes to reopen the space for large-group events in mid-March.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Expansion to Rosemont brings the Center closer to clients in Montco and Philly, according to CFF Program Director Erin Ziegelmeyer. And the refurbished large-group space will allow CFF to hold community events that address mental health, addiction and learning issues. “We really want to partner with local businesses and groups who might want to rent the space and collaborate with us,” says Ziegelmeyer. “The Main Line wants a community center, a place where kids can go. We want to be that resource.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So CFF is taking over the support groups formed under the arts/entertainment hang out called New Leaf ... is that about right? Oh, but wait! Here\'s the kicker: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fascinating footnote: CFF runs a rather unique high school out of its Malvern location for kids struggling with addiction, bullying, eating disorders and other mental health issues. Currently 13 teens who “slipped under the radar” at schools like Conestoga and private schools attend the school which debuted last fall, Ziegelmeyer tells us. The program includes four hours of teacher-led academics followed by a range of therapeutic activities and outings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fascinating? I\'d say it\'s a red flag thrown and being waved about! So there you have it. I\'m as confused as anyone. Galen snapping shots with Branson. A woman who apparently has no credentials forming centers so they can talk about depression, addiction, and bulimia? Sounds like a fun time!</p>',

           No comment there. But just because she posts pics eating pizza, and goes to school in the sex tourist trade capital of the world, it doesn't mean she hangs out with whores or something ...

           Yeah, I'm afraid it does. If you'll notice on that Linked In page that she worked for something called the Carbon War Room. That's Richard ''Virgin'' Branson's little group.  Here's the story:

            I thought that this would be a fun picture to share since our guest speaker Brad Schallert from the World Wildlife Fund gave Sir Richard Branson and the NGO he founded in DC, the Carbon War Room, a shout out during our most recent class. I interned for the CWR last school year and had the opportunity to sit in on a meeting with Richard Branson in March 2012.

          <p>
           Yeah, well, of course, EVERY girl gets to sit in on a meeting with SIR Richard Branson and I'm sure he poses with anybody who asks! So WTH are you making a big deal out of it?
          </p>
          <p>
           So the question remains does the name Galen signify anything? And why was that little boy being raised by something much worse than wolves was called Gaelen? Coincidence? Not a coincidence? The reason I'm asking is because you know that article I started out posting? The one in Part I that announces the opening of Mary Nixon's New Leaf hangout for teens? Oh, how did they describe it again?

          <p>
           Yup, just a place to hang out. Well, look at it now: Mary Nixon Hiltbrand is now leasing the space and, well, wait until you read what happened to the New Leaf Club!
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <h1>
            Center for Families takes over New Leaf Club HQ, plans new community center
           </h1>
           <p>
            ANEU’s not the only western biz heading east. Only a year old, the non-profit Center for Families (CFF) in Malvern is expanding to a second location in Rosemont, taking over the New Leaf Club next to the new ANEU.
           </p>
           <p>
            After five years, New Leaf is turning over a new leaf. It will operate out of offices in Bala Cynwyd.
           </p>
           <p>
            “We’re getting out of the building and personnel business but our mission is the same,” says New Leaf Club founder Mary Nixon, who owns the building and leases to ANEU and to CFF.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since its founding, scores of youth and families struggling with addiction, mental health issues have found kinship, information and support at New Leaf.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           WTF? I thought it was a place for kids to hang out? What's this with addiction and mental health issues?!!! Does she have any degrees? I don't see a Dr. anywhere, but there's more:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Nixon says the shift away from bricks and mortar will likely mean a more intense focus on New Leaf’s uplifting arts and entertainment programs.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Arts and entertainment? I thought the article just said they were focusing on mental health/addiction issues? Which is it?
          </p>
          <p>
           Support groups that began under the auspices of New Leaf are still meeting upstairs at the Rosemont facility. The first floor remains closed for renovations. CFF hopes to reopen the space for large-group events in mid-March.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Expansion to Rosemont brings the Center closer to clients in Montco and Philly, according to CFF Program Director Erin Ziegelmeyer. And the refurbished large-group space will allow CFF to hold community events that address mental health, addiction and learning issues. “We really want to partner with local businesses and groups who might want to rent the space and collaborate with us,” says Ziegelmeyer. “The Main Line wants a community center, a place where kids can go. We want to be that resource.”
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           So CFF is taking over the support groups formed under the arts/entertainment hang out called New Leaf ... is that about right? Oh, but wait! Here's the kicker:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            A fascinating footnote: CFF runs a rather unique high school out of its Malvern location for kids struggling with addiction, bullying, eating disorders and other mental health issues. Currently 13 teens who “slipped under the radar” at schools like Conestoga and private schools attend the school which debuted last fall, Ziegelmeyer tells us. The program includes four hours of teacher-led academics followed by a range of therapeutic activities and outings.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Fascinating? I'd say it's a red flag thrown and being waved about! So there you have it. I'm as confused as anyone. Galen snapping shots with Branson. A woman who apparently has no credentials forming centers so they can talk about depression, addiction, and bulimia? Sounds like a fun time!

              That is the opposite of where I was going, but go on with your bad self. I am suggesting that they are indeed the real parents, and are propping/maybe some prepping their children as actors in the grand event. Children that are really used would not likely to be their own, you understand. Only those that buck the system.

                 I've worked for some big companies, and the elite ones, they're so nice to work for. They do like to keep things comfy for themselves. Course, I never saw them at a ritual. I'd probably change my opinion.

            I really don't care what ANYONE in the mainstream says to the contrary that Pizzagate and the entire PEDOGATE illuminati plan to invert the entire world is real or not because WE people, US, helped take a good portion of that SCAB off THE BEAST to expose the fact that there really is a luciferian CULT trying to make and mold society into it's own disgusting and licentious image.

            We can SEE all you filthy little demons writhing in your sin and squirming around that your little faggot utopia you were trying to build is in jeopardy and that you have a bigger enemy than you thought you had.

            <p>
             For as long as she can recall, Mary Nixon Hiltbrand has wanted to create a gathering place for teens and young adults on the Main Line.
            </p>
            <p>
             "It just clicked," Hiltbrand said of the project. "The right people kept showing up at the right time."
            </p>
            <p>
             Next month, after $175,000 worth of remodeling, the New Leaf Cafe will open on Montrose Avenue behind the Rosemont Square shopping center in Lower Merion Township.
            </p>
            <p>
             The 4,000-square-foot building has a juice bar, a cafe with tea, coffee, and sandwiches, WiFi hookup, al fresco dining, and a yoga studio.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most important to Hiltbrand, though, is the public meeting room with a live stage that can be used for student art shows, seminars, dances, comedy, musical shows, or just hanging out.

              GAELEN? Did they say, "GAELEN"?

             <p>
              It's here the German Shepherd attacks. I'd run across that name when researching Maggie Nixon. I have a very wide circle of friends and not one is named Gaelen. So what are the chances that this name matches the name of someone in the Nixon extended family? It could be a coincidence, but is there something more? As stated above, I was all set to post on Gaelen or Galen or however you're spelling that name these days. Is this one of those trendy transsexual names that you don't have to change when you're fed your hormone blockers in your cereal at the age of 3? You be the judge.
             </p>
             <p>
              When I did the initial dumpster dive re: Maggie Nixon, I decided to try her extended family. After all, if it was as big a rabbit hole as touted, then the rest of Agnes Nixon's children must play a part, no? So when I dd the search for Agnes Nixon's children, the name of Mary Nixon came up:

            <p>
             So the question remains does the name Galen signify anything? And why was that little boy being raised by something much worse than wolves was called Gaelen? Coincidence? Not a coincidence? The reason I'm asking is because you know that article I started out posting? The one in Part I that announces the opening of Mary Nixon's New Leaf hangout for teens? Oh, how did they describe it again?

           <p>
            Given everything that you've pointed out, I'd say you may very well be on to something here... it's rare for curiosities like this to be merely coincidental.
           </p>

            Let's use one of my favorite resources for a moment, to learn about the name.

             Modern form of the Greek name Γαληνος (Galenos), which meant "calm" from Greek γαληνη (galene). It was borne by a 2nd-century BC Greco-Roman physician who contributed to anatomy and medicine. In modern times the name is occasionally given in his honour.

            <h2>
             A new ANEU in Rosemont
            </h2>
            <p>
             ANEU has sprouted anew.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Paoli-based caterer and “Kitchen &amp; Juicery” just opened a second outpost near the Rosemont train station.
And boy, is it a keeper.
            </p>
            <p>
             We breezed in on opening day for a quick look-see. Darn if we didn’t stay a while, sipping ANEU’s new elixir, sampling tasty salads and sweets, and admiring the café’s bright-and-fresh vibe.
            </p>
            <p>
             The new ANEU replaces the Gryphon Café at what was, until very recently, the headquarters of the New Leaf Club. (For more on that switcheroo, see below.)
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             With just 28 seats, the place is small, but its grab-and-go selection is mighty.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Most of my catering clients are on this side,” says owner Meridith Coyle, referring to the Main Line’s Great (unofficial) Divide, the Blue Route. “Lots of customers from our days at Strafford Farmer’s Market are coming in. We’ve been packed.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Indeed, it was ANEU Catering client Mary Nixon, the building’s owner and founder of the New Leaf Club once housed there, who urged Coyle to lease the café space.~~

             Catering sounds fishy because non profit, like non Dr. What grabs my attention is the name Main Line. When a junky wants to inject something in the body, they are looking for a main line, or main vein. Hardly something you would consider naming a charity interested in getting people off hard drugs. That's like putting an AA meeting in a fully stocked and well lighted bar after hours.Makes me wonder if they were not just selling fentanyl laced heroin and claiming the proceeds as tax deductible to clear the area for real estate acquisitions.

              Obviously you presented too many facts without repeating the significance of each and every one of them (ad nauseam) in a numbered and color charted manner. Maybe a video compilation with special effects and famous actors would help some.

                You know what your problem is? You think too much. That is usually meant as a threat in the USA, and every other country in the World, just in case you did not know. I am still kind of alive after that threat. I am afraid to drive a vehicle on the road for fear of killing others now.

                 I hear you and have had the experience of showing up on the first day of work and had the CIA asset in the company say, "You know, you're smart."

                 Yeah, no. It wasn't a compliment. I knew it wasn't and knew what they were driving at so I said, "No, really, I'm not!" I was really careful what I said around that guy from then on, but he never got off my back.

                  In my experience, that is what was said to me before I got poisoned. Organophosphates include Sarin and mustard gas, but are sold in every home depot/lowes,Ace hardware in severely lethal doses. One would have a harder time as a mass murderer collecting materials for a bomb, than simply spraying a room with bug spray. That is a proven fact.

                    No big deal, that is life and death. My only wish is for people to understand what those multitudes of compounds can do to a living organism. T cell receptors give electric signals from the gut to the brain. That also works the other way. Damage those receptors, and you have a failed system. Breathing is a part of that, without going into too much detail. I only learned this after getting a dose.
