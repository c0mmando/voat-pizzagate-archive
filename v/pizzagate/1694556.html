<p>I made this list of people and organizations involved in #pizzagate and #pedogate and I think it is incomplete!! The idea of my article, if I can ever finish it is to layer information over each of these points. Or map them somehow.</p>
<p>---- excerpt ----</p>
<p>Within the hundreds of people who are involved in this emerging scandal, there are many types of people involved in compartmentalized work. Thousands more do not know that they allow and facilitate evil.</p>
<ul>
<li>Academics who operate safe houses connected to religious schools (e.g. schools filled with acquired orphans from NGO-connected countries.)</li>
<li>Art dealers who operate fronts for money laundering and purchase of alternate goods (e.g. children or drugs included in the purchase price of art). The Modern Art market, internationally, is the largest unregulated market in the world. It allows the Elite to move massive amounts of capital unseen. Similarly, within the upper-middle-class, the Visionary art movement is a cover for the same type of activities as well as being a sacred house of worship for the Luciferian family.</li>
<li>Business people who run bars and restaurants as social gathering places for their “family” or to socialize with would-be customers for the special goods they offer. Sometimes, these places are used as a place of worship.</li>
<li>Psychologists and psychiatrists who are involved in the continuation of the CIA’s MKUltra/Monarch program, an advanced R&amp;D program into psychological manipulation or mind-control. This program had to be taken “off-the-books” after horrific details of its practices were exposed in the media. (e.g. Psychologists who study Leadership, electroshock shock therapy, LSD influence and Dissociated Identity Disorder, formerly known as multiple-personality disorder)</li>
<li>Foundations that give grants and support artists who promote the sexualization of children, the performance of mock-cannibalism and the sale of organs (Clinton Foundation/Marina Abramovic and Bush Foundation/Stu Mead)</li>
<li>Military Industrial Complex contractors who operate key services in the transport of organs, human remains, infants and children from war zones to underground U.S. operations who trade in these products. (e.g. DynCorp’s work in Kosovo)
Government agencies minded by people intimately connected to the business of covering up multiple ways in which the system exploits children in the U.S. while maintaining that “human trafficking” is only a problem internationally (e.g. U.S. State Department’s 7th floor shadow government)</li>
<li>Private enterprises who benefit financially from the removal of children from their parents and the diagnosis of them as mentally ill. (e.g. Child Protective Services)</li>
<li>Women who are manipulated into choosing adoption by operators of fake abortion clinics related to small religious groups. In other cases, women who accept money or non-financial favors to produce babies for friends, family or other contacts.</li>
<li>Private birthing centers and adoption agencies who are able to produce babies outside of the normal registration process.</li>
<li>Technology firms who get to decide which abduction cases get national attention, and which don’t (e.g. Amber Alert).</li>
<li>NGOs who scoop up and take exclusive ownership of photos and videos of child abuse allowing them to trade in the strategic information contained within. (e.g. NCMEC, ICMEC and Thorn)</li>
<li>Performers and bands who make MKUltra-inspired or pedophilia-related videos. (e.g. Sex Stains and Heavy Breathing)</li>
<li>Lobbyists who trade in strategic info or seek to control policy makers and politicians on behalf of their clients, both national and international. (e.g. The Podesta Group)</li>
<li>Highly visible and powerful political agents who protect high-level VIP pedophiles against inquiry or arrest. (e.g. Hillary Clinton’s work on behalf of the Ambassador to Belgium during the Dutroux scandal cover-up).</li>
<li>Highly visible and powerful political agents who rescue Americans arrested while involved in child exploitation operations worldwide. (e.g. Hillary Clinton’s work on behalf of Laura Silsby in Haiti and Bill Clinton’s work on behalf of Laura Ling in Korea.)
Religious groups, both mainstream and cult-ish, constantly associated with sexual exploitation scandals all over the world. (e.g. Catholic Church)</li>
<li>U.N.-related agencies who are supposed to protect children all-the-while hosting child abuse video production facilities in their basement (e.g. UNESCO in Brussels).</li>
<li>Republican and democratic politicians who enjoy an intimate relationship with the pedophile “service class”, or act under the influence of manipulators who have “Brownstone Operation”-type incriminating evidence against them. (e.g. Those most closely involved with the efforts to remove Trump.)</li>
<li>Quirky artists who make products supposedly sourced from human remains.</li>
<li>Movers and shakers very active in the sexual exploitation of young women who own private islands where VIPs are filmed having sex with underaged women. (e.g. Jeffrey Epstein)</li>
<li>Programmers who fracture children into a state of dissociation via traumatization, in order to make them easier to manage within a Satanic ritual abuse circle, a child sex exploitation ring or a program designed to use them for a specific lifelong purpose.</li>
<li>Social Media Platforms where people who sell their children or other children for sex can advertize (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and youtube)</li>
<li>Pundits, writers and talking heads, related to persons of interest, who publish coordinated prose to decry the fight against human trafficking as “fake news”. (e.g. CNN’s Jake Tapper)</li>
<li>Community influencers who protect accused pedophiles and write recommendations letters for them, or install them in positions of power once their short sentence is over.</li>
<li>Convicted pedophiles who change their name in order to continue working for the government and avoid detection via the registry system.</li>
<li>Real Estate Agents who help VIP pedophiles find adequate private properties to rent for private parties.</li>
<li>Chefs who specialize in the preparation of human flesh for consumption (includes those who specialize in the consumption of the placenta).</li>
<li>Celebrities who pattern their performances after Luciferian references or “illuminati” symbolism to prove their adherance and obedience to the Satanist Elites. (Lady Gaga’s Luciferian flight, Beyonce’s Grammy performance and costume.)</li>
<li>Parents who provide their children to the service class or the Elites in return for money and influence or inclusion.</li>
<li>Performance artists who execute artistic rituals designed around mock-cannibalism or the promotion of human remains (skeletons), organs (heart transplants). (e.g. Marina Abramovic)</li>
<li>Doctors, dentists and pediatricians who serve families connected to organized child sexual exploitation and protect parents involved in this system.</li>
<li>Corrupted officials who must be paid in sexual services or drugs because they are prevented by law from receiving cash.</li>
<li>Fabricators and construction companies that install underground hiding rooms, and play rooms or make cages and secure holding facilities.</li>
<li>Financial institutions that help criminals launder the profits of drugs and human trafficking. (eg. HSBC and Franklin Credit Union)
International royalty who require disposable human entertainment.</li>
<li>Museums, attractions and other facilities with decommissioned government bunkers who house children.</li>
<li>Religious groups or charities used to remove children from orphanages and transport them to the United States. (e.g. Laura Silsby)</li>
<li>Farmers who use their livestock to dispose of human remains.</li>
<li>Art collectors who support, fund and patronize artists who depict themes of pedophilia, ritual sexual abuse, traumatization of children and mind control. (e.g. Anthony and Heather Podesta modern art collection)</li>
<li>Fertility clinics who help parents produce children who will bear organs compatible with Elites who have rare genetic disorders or clients requiring anti-aging treatments or organs for transplant in the future.</li>
<li>Art groups who maintain access to the underground tunnel systems present in most cities associated with Luciferian practices and human trafficking.</li>
<li>Camping ground and social group operators who cater to Luciferian or CIA-connected families.</li>
<li>Hotels who host American patrons looking for sexual services by underaged boys and grils.</li>
<li>Photographers who advertise photography of young women in seductive poses.</li>
<li>Local newspapers and blogs concerned with the promotion of the official or non-official cover of people connected to the CIA and/or Luciferian groups. (e.g. The Washingtonian and Bright Young Things)</li>
<li>Business people who participate in sleepovers and off-the-record meetings at the White House and travel with the First family. (e.g. James Alefantis)</li>
<li>Pop stars who write pedophilic anthems laden with code words about child sex while normalizing the “secret pizza party” and satanic subculture of sexual abuse. (e.g. Kathy Perry, Lady Gaga, Madonna, Miley Cyrus)</li>
<li>Art directors who create videos rife with pedophilia imagery.</li>
<li>Powerful connector who knows or is related to people in each of the groups mentioned above, as well as advising the president of the United States and his chosen successor and who choose to bring up cannibalism when asked about unrelated subjects. (e.g. John Podesta)</li>

            Question, specifically about the ART and ARTISTS categories (probably applies to all categories). If we find specific artists and galleries peddling sexualized images of, or geared towards, children - is this the best sub to post such
            <strong>
             specific
            </strong>
            links? Since there are so many, getting specific here could eventually flood the sub with just that one topic. Some such things could be submitted on their own, but that seems disorganized, and things get deleted or just slide away. Any suggestions?

            I'm wondering why this sub isn't high in the "Top" subs. It has more upvoats than many there. I can't make sense of how "Top" and "Hot" are determined.

            I just saw this article today, and think it might fit here. If it doesn't, or there's a better place to submit, or it's not of value, please say so. Also, I know many of us are mistrustful of gov agencies that deal with sexual exploitation, abuse, etc., but maybe that's a reason to check this out. In any case, I hope we will all continue to remember, and contribute to, this sub.

            Under President Bush a law was enacted that allowed the medical community to administer riskier drug trials to children who were under the care of the state.  The medical community jumped on that new law and there are children who are removed purposely to enable them to participate in trials.  There are a number of children's hospitals in this country who have a preponderance for reporting a parent to CPS to achieve their agenda and CPS is only too happy to comply.  Most of these parents are charged by the hospital staff of Munchausen's which is a syndrome that is reported in medical journals to POSSIBLY affect only 2/100000 people however there's been a rash of these Munchausen's allegations over the past several years resulting in parents losing their children.   There are several medical conditions/complexities that children have where they have been placed in state's care.   Children with feeding tubes because of gastro issues, autistic children and children with brittle bones have compromised a large group who've been removed from their families over the past few years.   Is it  a mere coincidence that these hospitals were running drug trials on those specific conditions?   There are approximately 1500-2000 trials available to hospitals to apply for but they need "guinea pigs" to conduct their trials and when the trials are risky it behooves them to initiate a removal.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a win/win for the hospital and CPS because CPS is then paid by the FED to the tune of 85k on average per child and well over 100k per child if the child has medical complexities.  The medical facility benefits by receiving grants to conduct the trials and if the trials are successful it helps to elevate their status.   Also Medicaid pays for every dime of the child's medical care
as a ward of the state.

            May I suggest:
ENFORCERS: law enforcement that have the capability to suppress an investigation, or intimidate victims or advocates.
Can also work in a a security or protective capacity such as the secret service.
           </p>
           <p>
            JUDGES: Conspirators are put in judicial positions in order to suppress or delegitimize an investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS: ( there is probably a better term for it) such as the MS13 gang which help fund and provide supplies such as children, weopons, money, buyers, and even henchmen.

            Your post is excellent, yesterday I watched the Matt Laurer and Hillary clinton interview, the one where she said they would all hang if she lost; and it was so telling. Knowing what we know today about how this vast network operates, it is so clear she was relying on the network to protect her and help clear her reputation. Your post is great! Upvoat!!!

            Thanks for the video. I believe that the detention center plays a very big role in the next extermination of people (see stories of AU detention center run by G4 on Christmas Island). But in the U.S. who are people who are expendable? Is it people who don't have credit? Is it people who don't have jobs? Is it immigrants? The people who are actively being targetted and killed by those in power is black men. But it is us poor people who hold up society via work and disproportionally high tarrifs on food, loans, etc. It's hard to save when you have little money. We poor people circulate money like there is no tomorrow. None of it is saved or horded away. Gosh if Trump enacted Universal Basic Income the country would be awash in economic growth funded by McDonald's employees who could afford to eat at McDonald's :) But now he is adding 54B to the MIC, not the people :(

            This is the most eloquent articulation of the sheer scale and detail of this issue but personally, has helped me to better collate all of the information I have been  absorbing (without the tech ability to archive properly - makes for a sore brain, I promise). More importantly, this has presented me a means by which I can share this information without having to try to explain to the uninitiated and ending up turning them off with my ineptitude to get the details across. A version without the names names would be an excellent piece to share and persuade others to further investigate.  But thank you.  It's helped my sore brain immensely.  Upvoated.

             There are hundreds of pages of reference documentation missing from this. This is just a beginning. Here's a question. Obviously, the people doing this are violating the law... but what law? Americans change laws in small ways to make unethical things legal. Hillary Clinton has done a lot of her work under diplomatic immunity. This is not a "get out of jail free" card but it does place boundaries around investigating her that will last her until she croaks. There has been egregious violation of the public trust. But these people are often transnationals. They are globalists and operate in a system above country. And the people who manage treaties are also involved... So HOW DO WE SUE THESE MOTHERFUCKERS when there doesn't seem to be a jurisdictions that applies?

            Would another category for Amusement Parks be helpful? I've long had the theory Disneyland was used as a scouting ground.

            <li>
             Children from all over the country and world are taken to the "happiest place on Earth".
            </li>
            <li>
             Parents register children with "safety bracelets" and other measures in case they are "lost".
            </li>
            <li>
             Disneyland database of children and home addresses is used after the families return home to know where to go to abduct the children.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            In the Johnny Gosh documentaries I've seen picture folders with names and addresses were mentioned. These were order books The Finders would use to go and abduct the ordered children.

            I have wondered about the Moron church and their control over Ancestory.com.  They get you to spit in a tube and now they have access to all your DNA.  If you think the CIA does not have your DNA your mistaken.  The CIA and FBI draft heavily in the Moron community.  They could target potential abductions and search for matches for their Elite clients.  They could find a perfect organ match and send their teams to snatch whoever they wanted.

            Last year I did this DNA test.   I really dont like the fact I did it now.

             Yes, the wholesale collection of DNA is a security risk given that we are uncovering a network of people concerned with bloodlines and genetic markers. The public needs to be educated to these realities.

            Psychologists who push the False Memory Syndrome Foundation lies shut down investigation into this cesspool for about 30 years in the US.  Any allegation of SRA was rejected as absurd.  Victims and their families were attacked.

            You know the Trump rallies locals held in various cities the last two weekends. I am sure they needed an infusion of energy. Trump needs to know his trump_train_army is prepared and probably senses rallying marches is the way to show force, peacefully. You must be a speech writer IRL because I can see an easy entree that would jump participants in these United_Trump_Peace events. That is if you can come up with the Venn info graphic, ginormous as it will be awesome. This line at the top, Thousands more do not know that they allow and facilitate evil. Along with - your raw from paste: People on the internet are obsessed with an emerging scandal that isn’t being covered by the mainstream media.
People in the media are obsessed with an emerging scandal they are not allowed to cover.
People in government are scared that the details of their manipulation and blackmail will come to light.
People in law enforcement are mad that they cannot do their job when it comes to a protected class of criminals.
The Trump administration has declared a goal to seriously hinder “Human Trafficking” in the United States ------
Perhaps a tipping point, of 16 million awakened people , that's the Titus Frost calculation for turning this towards a positive direction for ethical behavior on the planet without the LEO, GOV, INTEL doing their jobs. I do believe you are producing the tool to ring the Liberty Bell loud and clear!

             I do this... But as you can see, I am deftly afraid of these people. I posted this under an assumed name, so it wouldn't be associated to another assumed name LOL I have re-engineered my life to be able to speak out about this. I have 24/7 security. I shit you not, there is a man guarding my door while I sleep at night. I am not sure I can withstand an order of "life disruption" from the establishment because I am poor. But you'll see, there is a plan in progress.

              You do seem very deft at your info graphic plan. You and others have gone to great lengths for security and privacy. I hope you are not ordered for an expensive life disruption, too! Moving is pricey. I do see the organizational chart is good to go, as per your plan. It's truth is a weapon. It is a source of power. Use it for good.

            As an ardent atheist, I was stunned awhile ago to realize, like a lightening bolt striking my soul from the universe, that this is no less than a spiritual battle between good and evil, light and dark, life and death.  (My immediate impulse was to run over to my nearest Target and buy a necklace with a crucifix on it.  Hahaha!  I haven't gone that far, yet, but I still might.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Seeing things with new eyes gave me hope, courage, and direction.  (Not to be morose but only being honest, if it didn't, I would seriously consider killing myself.  What would be the point of anything any more?)
           </p>
           <p>
            So, thank you.

             Oh thank you zzvoat. Pizzagate is overwhelming. It will be hard to educate the people about it but finding ways to talk about it from as many angles as possible will mean that smaller topics can reach different kinds of people. These people may be able to provide greater context. Just the Real Estate Agent racket is but one field which yields half a dozen organized criminal scams... It's endless. I only wish to equip people with numbers to add up on their own.

              They also put the little girls underwear rack front and center in the main aisles. And recently a blogger complained about the clothes being very risqué for little girls as well. She compared the the inseam of toddler clothes to other stores and targets were basically daisy dukes, for toddlers!

            what about how odd it is that  alternative media outlets connected to the truth movement started the conversation about Satanic Ritual Abuse or SRA back in 2008-2010, have ties to some of the very people involved at comet ping pong.  for example james alefantis' good friend Septime Webre's brother ; Alfred Lambremont Webre runs exopolitics.com and has a vested interest in this subject matter, and controlling the narrative on it.  very peculiar connections

            I can see why, but I actually know someone who just got her certification in infant massage, she's an amazing sports injury therapist.
Not saying some pedos don't abuse that industry, just saying not all infant massage therapists are pedos.

             I recognize the validity of what you are saying. I am not a pedophile. I was a massage therapist for years and although the market for professional infant massage is minimal massage can be therapeutic for all. As a child my brother had one leg longer than the other and receiving chiropractic work from infanct on helped him prevent getting a hip replacement at a young age in adulthood. I could imagine babies born with specific muscle development or chronic pain issues and such could find some relief in massage.

            There is plenty wrong with the political Bush family but let's not pretend that it has anything to do with the "Bush Foundation". That is a completely different family with no known relations to the political Bush family.  I already debunked it in that Stu Mead thread.

            Hi Throwaway --
You might be interested in the type of mapping or format that George Webb uses very successfully -- 
Don't know if it's exactly what you had in mind, but thought I'd bring to your attention.

           <p>
            Webb has mentioned his series is based in Open Media research -- he's a citizen journalism - using story board design (Trello?) - Triangulates relationships - Shows how people are connected.

             I have seen some of George Webb's videos. It's true, that could be a format. I didn't expect so many people to chime in with such great comments. This dissection of the pizzagate world has a lot of potential if i can flesh out each point with a chronology of events and MSM news references, etc. I will consider this.

            GREAT WORK! I have batched these and given titles, incorporated the posted comments, &amp; listed them alphabetically. Ran into a limit of length so must make two separate posts. HERE IS PART ONE....
           </p>
           <p>
            ABORTION. The Abortion Industry and its role in trafficking in body parts. Fetal tissue is used in vaccines, making the industry tied to the hip of corrupt UN practices in the Third world.
           </p>
           <p>
            ART DEALERS. Art dealers who operate fronts for money laundering and purchase of alternate goods (e.g. children or drugs included in the purchase price of art). The Modern Art market, internationally, is the largest unregulated market in the world. It allows the Elite to move massive amounts of capital unseen. Similarly, within the upper-middle-class, the Visionary art movement is a cover for the same type of activities as well as being a sacred house of worship for the Luciferian family. Art groups who maintain access to the underground tunnel systems present in most cities associated with Luciferian practices and human trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            ARTISTS. Artists who depict themes of pedophilia, ritual sexual abuse, traumatization of children and mind control. Photographers who advertise photography of young women in seductive poses. Art directors and producers who create videos rife with pedophilia imagery.
           </p>
           <p>
            ART COLLECTORS. Patrons who support, fund and patronize artists depicting themes of pedophilia, ritual sexual abuse, traumatization of children and mind control. (e.g. Anthony and Heather Podesta modern art collection)
           </p>
           <p>
            BAR/RESTAURANTS. Business people who run bars and restaurants as social gathering places for their “family” or to socialize with would-be customers for the special goods they offer. Sometimes, these places are used as a place of worship.
           </p>
           <p>
            BREEDERS. Parents who provide their children to the service class or the Elites in return for money and influence or inclusion. Women who are manipulated into choosing adoption by operators of fake abortion clinics related to small religious groups. Women who accept money or non-financial favors to produce babies for friends, family or other contacts.
           </p>
           <p>
            BREEDING. Private birthing centers and adoption agencies who are able to produce babies outside of the normal registration process. Fertility clinics who help parents produce children who will bear organs compatible with Elites who have rare genetic disorders or clients requiring anti-aging treatments or organs for transplant in the future.
           </p>
           <p>
            BUREAUCRATS. Government agencies minded by people intimately connected to the business of covering up multiple ways in which the system exploits children in the U.S. while maintaining that “human trafficking” is only a problem internationally (e.g. U.S. State Department’s 7th floor shadow government)
           </p>
           <p>
            CHARITIES. Phony charities such as the Clinton Foundation acting as illegal slush funds. Many of these are nominally based around stopping the spread of infectious diseases such as AIDS, HIV and malaria. Religious groups or charities used to remove children from orphanages and transport them to the United States (e.g. Laura Silsby).

             PROGRAMMERS. Fracture children into a state of dissociation via traumatization, in order to make them easier to manage within a Satanic ritual abuse circle, a child sex exploitation ring or a program designed to use them for a specific lifelong purpose. Some of those who got their training in military intelligence programs have gone rogue and now do their programming / deprogramming on a freelance basis.
            </p>
            <p>
             RENTALS. Real Estate Agents who help VIP pedophiles find adequate private properties to rent for private parties.

            Suggestion for the list: All the paid shills trying to derail or discredit this investigation. Since they are protecting the pedo scum, legally they are all accomplices to their crimes and likely face jail time themselves. When the pedos get busted, perhaps we should identify the shills protecting them to LE. That would teach them a good lesson. :D

             I can't say I have seen that many shills in 2017. And I am not sure people can be paid to shill here. Because when you ask drones to shill here you are just exposing them to bottles after bottles of red pills. People who are here shilling must have personal reasons which are worth more than 5 cents a post.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, I am not sure that the "Pizzagate is Fake News" army knew, initially, that they were producing propaganda to protect the worst scum of the earth. Pizzagate is impossible to ignore and deny if you step in here because you can be sure an article on the first page will hit home. We have all witnessed and dismissed pizzagate for 30-40 years.

             Only if you associate massage with sexual gratification. I mean I can understand that people do that because everything has been oversexualized over the past 20 years. Even the word "teen" doesn't belong to teenagers anymore, only to porn. The sketchy guy who does infant massage is the only one we have found who does that. Yes, HE is sketch but I live with a masseuse and therefore only associate massage with extreme pain LOL

            This list could be very helpful in Consolidating and Gathering info for our Projects. We could definitely use a map like this.

            I know you are referring to infant message possibly based off that site where that man and his wife as well as child are shown on the site and I at first was disgusted how blunt they were but by reading the site it's a service to watch your kids as you receive your massage in hotel or whatever resort. Though they could be passing it off as that and those in the know read it for exactly what it says.

            We need to galvanize. We out number the evil elites. If they take down Trump, we buck up and come at them harder. They are buying time because a lot of useful idiots are still asleep. Wake them up and the elites have nothing.

            The goal of this is to expose how each type of professional does overtime for the continuation of the holocaust of children. How they benefit from it. How they pervert the very nature of their profession. And perhaps this can trigger professional groups to go after their own bad apples. Or, at least, we will know bad apples are installed on the board of the oversight committees.

             Get it together and make a video. Wear a mask or give it to someone else to present. Video is easier to get going viral, because let's face it, motherfuckers don't like to read a whole lot. But a video with this info could convert a fence-sitter into a believer. Exponential awareness! Nice work, friends.

              Do It! I always look for good content to listen to multitasking cooking, cleaning, etc. I love your RAW in PASTE with the Obessed, Obbessed, Scared, Mad list. Great by itself, very standalone. Why do I see flyers in doctors offices, travel agencies, all that are listed with warnings of what to be on the lookout for? A GoFundMe todo?

             I think that by naming professions we can trigger professionals to start going after their own bad apples. Because this is like trying to remove rocks from quinoa with only a magnifying glass and tweezers.

              I may have missed it, but I would add medical professionals, (specifically ER staff), who do not report abuse of possibly trafficked children bc they're a "lookout" for the local group. When a victim comes in they contain the "problem" and make sure the info gets back to the local people, even corrupted LE, to silence the victim.

               In the list of doctors. But your angle is interesting. I am not sure SRA families can count on ER staff. This is a field that sees amazing turnover. That is why NCMEC introduced themselves as an intermediate in the process. They encourage people to submit there, and they do not forward the info to the FBI/Police, unless the FBI/Police opens an investigation. NCMEC can spot cases related to VIPs and intervene. This causes a destruction of chain of evidence.

            There is an entire child entertainment/athlete/model/dancer angle... from "modeling" agencies to talent scouts like "dance moms" and pageants. There are young athletes and Olympians (often are abused by coaches etc.) ANYTHING that separates a child from their parents and puts them in the control of non-relative adults is suspect. Then you delve into children's entertainment such as song, music, shows, cartoons.. think Teletubbies,Barney, Sesame Street. The whole Olsen twins videos etc.

              None of your comments are helpful and they all highlight the fact you haven't really looked into any of the research. Critiques are largely welcome here becuase it helps us tighten up thinking, recognise flawed reasoning etc. But you're not offering any kind of helpful criticism, just silly one liners that only prove your ignorance about the whole thing. It would be much more helpful if you could go and read through the sticky on the front page and maybe have a good look through the Pizzagate wiki, learn what it's all about and why this work is important, and then come back and use your critical eye to actually help us make the investigation better, instead of just being all grumpy and sarcastic and wasteful of your own time!

              is pretty good at doing this, and it is very helpful in fact to have devil's advocates who actually test assumptions and warn against confirmation bias or point out inconsistencies. So if you can make yourself useful in that way, it would be much appreciated, if you're nice and pleasant about it! Thanks :-)

               Except for the part where I've
               <em>
                literally read all of the research
               </em>
               . I've read the sticky, all of the posts on the sticky, followed all of the links, read the website (which is essentially a rehash of the sticky), looked through a number of the Wiki entries, and seen numerous videos, most of which have been taken down for reckless doxxing.
              </p>
              <p>
               Your "research" doesn't need to be
               <em>
                corrected
               </em>
               . It needs to be thrown out. Every single item falls into one of three categories:
              </p>
              <ol>
               <li>
                Highly speculative and creative misinterpretation of e-mails based on a made-up "code" which is not corroborated by
                <strong>
                 any pre-existing documentation
                </strong>
                .
               </li>
               <li>
                Connections between people and entities that are
                <strong>
                 totally unsurprising
                </strong>
                given their personal and professional relationships, associations, and friendships.
               </li>
               <li>
                Character assassination based on guilt-by-association, bigotry, ignorance, and literal interpretations of humor and/or art, all also highly speculative in nature.
               </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
               For example: Tony Podesta is suspsected of pedophilia because he collects art. This is substantiated by three primary exhibits: the Arc of Hysteria statue, "multiple color pictures" by Katy Grannan, and a painting by Biljana Djurdjevic.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                The Arc of Hysteria
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               The statue is claimed to be inspired by the pose that Jeffery Dahmer put one of his victims in before photographing it. Not only are the poses
               <em>
                not actually identical
               </em>
               (Dahmer's victim has arms and legs fully bent at the elbows and knees while the statue's arms and legs hang down fully extended), but Dahmer's victim (Ernest Miller)
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer#Known_murder_victims">
                wasn't beheaded until after the photos were taken
               </a>
               . The image probably looks like it has no head because it's bent under the corpse at the neck. (And what are the chances that the artist of The Arc of Hysteria would have had access to that photograph in pre-Internet 1993?)
              </p>
              <p>
               What's more is that
               <em>
                Dahmer wasn't a pedophile
               </em>
               . Even if the statue were inspired by Dahmer (and there isn't any documentation that supports the claim that it was), it would
               <em>
                have nothing to do with pedophilia
               </em>
               . Guilt by association, plain and simple. It's good-old-fashioned ad-hominem
               <em>
                that isn't even true
               </em>
               .
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Katy Grannan
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Tony Podesta's house apparently contain unidentified images by a photographer "
               <a href="https://www.sott.net/article/334002-Progressive-liberal-values-Tony-Podestas-creepy-taste-in-art-the-creepy-people-he-hangs-out-with-and-Pizzagate">
                known for documentary-style pictures of naked teenagers
               </a>
               ". Yet the question remains: are the photographs in Podesta's house "documentary-style pictures of naked teenagers"?
              </p>
              <p>
               If not, again, we have guilt by association. He has work by an artist, that artist also makes controversial work (which he apparently doesn't own), therefore he's assumed to be as guilty as he would be if he owned the controversial work itself.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Biljana Djurdjevic
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Yet another case of guilt by association! The paintings that Podesta owns are
               <em>
                not the paintings used to implicate him
               </em>
               . The paintings in Podesta's house show
               <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/images/thumb/0/01/Biljana_Djurdjevic_Seemingly_Deceased_Girls_in_Swamp.jpeg/1000px-Biljana_Djurdjevic_Seemingly_Deceased_Girls_in_Swamp.jpeg">
                kids lying on the ground in a circle, fully clothed
               </a>
               . But because Djurdjevic
               <em>
                also happens to paint really twisted images of kids apparently suffering abuse
               </em>
               (none of which have been shown to be owned by Podesta) this is considered evidence that he
               <em>
                might be a pedophile
               </em>
               .
              </p>
              <p>
               I could literally go through the whole archive of Pizzagate evidence and expose the flaws of your entire stupid theory, but I'm not even sure I want to put in the time and effort for something that might not actually pay off. In the meantime, you'll have to excuse my snark. This place is full of gullible idiots who want nothing more than an excuse to shoot off a few rounds in a random pizza parlor.

              I am speaking specifically about ONE on ONE coaches and teachers for HIGHLY TRAINED and DEVELOPED children for acting and Olympics... I am not talking about your 1st grade teacher in Duluth.

              I am speaking of teachers and coaches that spend SIGNIFICANT ONE ON ONE time ALONE with a specific child. Traveling around with said child sometimes without parents. These would be kids who are athletes, performers, singers, dancers, movie stars... I am NOT referring to your local 1st grade teacher in Wichita.

             I didn't even consider the pedowood side of all of this. I concentrated on political/satanist/cia side of it. Consider this an early attempt at nailing the pedogate infographic we all need. But if you can define your excellent points into jobs and function (who does what) then it will be great for the list. Thank you!

              Hope it can be of help... here is my attempt for the details you requested... again, hope this can be of help:
*Children's sports coaches and those involved in child athletic/Olympic competition. From gymnastics to swim, soccer, wrestling, etc. Coaches that work one on one alone with children and travel out of state/country with children. Children who are athletes that are forced to live in training camps etc. People who run such camps.
*Children talent and modeling competitions. Dance, cheer, theater, acting, pageants, modeling. Again, coaches and so called "talent scouts." I lived in Los Angeles and saw this type of predator quite often. Photographers and fashion modeling is infamous for this. They target children of all ages, races, and genders. Many children are pressured to have sex to score the role/shoot. Photographers are a BIG one! 
*Children in film and entertainment such as television and movies. Casting directors and acting coaches. Casting directors can be just as bad as photographers mentioned above. Adult co-stars, looking into the horrible details regarding Bob Saget and Olsen twins. Parents desperate to get their kids famous. Children based tv shows and all involved in their production, casting, writing, marketing. Barney, Sesame street, etc. Think Corey Feldman, Drew Barrymore, Shirley Temple.

            What a massively great list.  I have two to add (unless I missed them or they are included under 'public officials') 
1) federal, state and local law enforcement 
2) judges

             Yes. I do think some cases are routed towards courts that are "in-the-know" i.e. how Edgar Maddison Welch is being managed. School-to-prison pipeline.

              In the UK it's become noticeable that the same few judges will handle certain controversial child abuse cases, particularly those involving Satanic ritual abuse, and invariably their judgement is that anyone who believes in such nonsense is 'either evil or stupid' - those were literally the wordsof one judge I believe, commenting on the Hampstead case - and no one goes to prison and the victims are revictimised in the press/on social media.

               But people (worldwide) will no longer be able to see Satanism as "a funny inside joke" when the evidence is laid out. But this is a thorny topic. We have to avoid the "Satanic Panic" glibness of the sheeples. They (in USA) have a 1st Amendment Right to freedom of religion if we force them out of the closet. They can hire Barack Obama to defend them even...

             Pretty sure they are trying to figure out a way to roll these people up on corruption charges. Because this has been the M.O. in the past 8-10 years. Whenever a person gets covered in the media as a child sex offender or pedophile or human trafficker, the subsequent reports downplay that aspect of it. It is a directive from the top to make sure the general public never cues into this topic as existing. Mass mind-control.

             Well, there is a large list of places related to museums that have new or supposedly disused secret facilities or are sketchy. The farm (in McLean), The Getty Museum, The Smithsonian (is mostly underground) and Droop Mountain. The thing is that within the Luciferian or Satanic visionary art movement, the museum (or art gallery) is a place of social gathering and worship. Ted Gunderson (sp?) said over a decade ago that there are 4 million practicing Satanists in the U.S. These people need discreet places of worship that change frequently so that they can pursue activities which are sacred to them, but illegal in the U.S.

              The whole "underground art room" for Tony Pedosta was such a clear example of this. No normie has a room set up specifically to watch videos pertaining to "art". Seemed to be a gathering place for a secret society of some sort. The fact that BO moved in a couple doors down should cement any thoughts he isn't involved with these pedos.

            BCCI as criminal bank, royal families as additional category, and CPS is not a private enterprise it's govt so get a better example, no mention of those with close ties to Israel bro? No Soros who fbi anon called the kingpin?

             The list is incomplete, as stated in the introduction. Your input is welcomed. If you can format it in the form of "WHO does WHAT" it will greatly help. I am doing this to form a Venn diagram of the types of people involved. They all have different motivations and payouts from participating in this whole ball of whacks and it is often tied to their tiny bubble world. Compartmentalized.

              It is hard to write about this and be super precise. Words have been so mangled by propaganda that you can have a conversation with another and realize neither of you have the right definition of a word.

              And, as such, writing about Satanism is hard too.

             This is a first jet. This article names names in a way that could get the blogs in trouble. There exists mainstream media and VOAT threads about each and every phrase in the article. I just haven't done that bit. But if someone can do the "fact checking" part, they are welcome to use this in any way they want and put their name on it.
