            In the United States, FinCEN requires that an SAR be filed by a financial institution when the financial institution suspects insider abuse by an employee; violations of law aggregating over $5,000 where a subject can be identified;[clarification needed] violations of law aggregating over $25,000 regardless of a potential subject; transactions aggregating $5,000 or more that involve potential money laundering or violations of the Bank Secrecy Act; computer intrusion; or when a financial institution knows that a customer is operating as an unlicensed money services business.

             So transactions across hundreds of possible businesses involving $5k–25k are examined as suspicious, but the FBI claims only 1% turn out to be actionable.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's known via the Franklin Savings Conspiracy case that the FBI or certain agents cover for sex trafficking &amp; this type complicity was also seen in the Finders/CIA cult trafficking case.
            </p>
            <p>
             That of all the hundreds or thousands of businesses that trigger a SARS report of large transactions, usually bank deposits or money transfers, that randomly "pizza cases" stand out above all others, besides the FBI published the "cheese pizza" definition among sex trafficking terms seems more than coincidence.
            </p>
            <p>
             As if to say, oh ignore those CP transactions, we let those slide. Unless running a pizza business is so outrageously profitable that $5k–25k days are commonplace. I worked at a Dominoes briefly &amp; like most businesses cash is deposited nightly, though hard to imagine such volume at least in a small metropolis of 50k in my experience.
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe there's nothing to it but post Pizzagate seems more than coincidental, while the rationale of federal agencies being involved in sex trafficking, like drug running, begs credulity.

            Relevance to PG seems to be that this NSA program tracked large financial transactions &amp; the FBI, who published terms used in sex trafficking, has referred to "pizza" while this same usage re huge financial transactions such as the Obama Whitehouse importing Chicago "pizza" at about $60k (if I recall) seems a flag. One might expect food caterers but why "pizza" and of all the thousands of possible business types?
           </p>
           <p>
            "A warrantless surveillance program known by the code name "Stellar Wind" (or "Stellarwind") began under the George W. Bush administration's President's Surveillance Program (PSP). The National Security Agency (NSA) program was approved by President Bush shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks, and was revealed by Thomas Tamm to The New York Times in 2008. Stellar Wind was a prelude to new legal structures that allowed President Bush and President Barack Obama to reproduce each of those programs and expand their reach..."
           </p>
           <p>
            "The intelligence community also was able to obtain from the U.S. Treasury Department suspicious activity reports, or "SARS", which are reports of activities such as large cash transactions that are submitted by financial institutions under anti-money laundering rules...."
           </p>
           <p>
            "There were internal disputes within the U.S. Justice Department about the legality of the program, because data are collected for large numbers of people, not just the subjects of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants. During the Bush Administration, the Stellarwind cases were referred to by FBI agents as "pizza cases" because many seemingly suspicious cases turned out to be food takeout orders. According to then-FBI Director Robert Mueller, approximately 99% of the cases led nowhere, but "it's that other 1% that we've got to be concerned about"..."
