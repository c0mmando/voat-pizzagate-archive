At first when I read all the PG related Podesta emails I was shocked and appalled but after chewing on this for three months now and diving more into the rest of his emails, they don\'t seem all that abnormal in their context and I am starting to believe they are not code at all.For example, the dominos/pizza/pasta email. After reading more emails searching the word dominoes one can plainly see that he is a big fan of the game and plays socially.There is even a picture that has surfaced of him playing. That famous email is IMO the same thing as saying &quot;Do you think I\'d be better playing Poker on licqour or on beer&quot; Along with all the other suspicious emails, there is not one that doesn\'t have a logical explanation if read in context. Another example, the Luzzato email can be interpreted as creepy but Old people like the company of little kids and I know my grandparents (R.I.P) would be entertained by 3 kids playing in the pool and bringing out their youthful side. Its just worded a little strange. The famous fish and 14 on his hands picture. What you don\'t see is the caption above the tweet about his Initiative 14 to save the oceans. He was simply trying to being attention to the &quot;bill&quot; as saving the oceans has always been a campaign of his. Yes and then there\'s the artwork, yes its creepy but not illegal. Alot of people like a lot of weird shit, its this melting pot of different tastes in culture, art and music that make America what it is, Spirit cooking, I believe to be just a silly fad that elite actors and artists have hyped up and I know alot of people that are totally normal good people that if they got invited to a free event/dinner that they would go just to see the spectacle.Why doesnt he just respond to the accusations? I used to troll his twitter and think the same thing, but really, if he is innocent, he doesnt owe anybody jackshit.I can understand it royally pissing him off and having his PR people tell him not to touch it with a ten foot pole. I cannot explain his resemblance to the McCann drawings and I want to stress that I am not trying to probe him innocent but rather jus t trying to provide some narrative that there might not be anything to the emails. I think we all need to have a more open mind and not use PG as a Democratic bashing outlet and we need to consider all avenues and outlets even if it incriminates your lord and savior Trump. There is just as much circumstantial evidence against him as anybody else but he is immediately dismissed no matter what as this investigation is completely bipartisan. Do I still believe in Pedophillia at the highest levels of our Government? Absolutely. Am I a shill? Hell no. Did I vote for Hillary? Fuck no! If anyone has any other emails to bring up I would be happy to give a logical explanation and keep this investigation on the right people and in the right direction.</p>',

            Skippy, is that you?? Really? Attempting to equate a frat boy inquiry '{Yo duuuuude} do ya think I'll be better playing poker on liquor or on beer?' to a cryptic query referencing a specific game (and, btw, this question was being POSED to Podesta, so the fact that ol' Skippy here socially unwinds after a good child/mop session with a down home game of dominoes is irrelevant) and two, seemingly pulled out of the air references to two Italian dishes that just so happen to be both favorite foods of kids AND directly linked to code words outlined not by hearsay but by the FBI on their website????

            People have been investigated and arrested with less evidence or probable cause.
And sadly alot of that evidence was fabricated by corrupt cops and a DA

             Have people really been investigated and arrested with less evidence?

             Usually the planted stuff is physical and there's a victim.

                 Sigh.  I'm saying that even if it was possible, they wouldn't have done it.  It's too weak of a case to investigate.

                 Nobody fabricates cellphone records to implicate someone in a crime.  They put the murder weapon in his car or smear blood on his boots or something.

             I know right? Who talks like that unless your meaning something else. Pizza related map?   Whats it matter if a handkerchief is related to anything?
             <br/>
             Its just a handkerchief.  If i was told about a handkerchief that was found and forward to me  about who possibly owned it wouldn't it be obvious to assume ohh john does these weird rituals with Handkerchiefs and young girls ie. Pizza related activities ill ask him if it belongs to him .

            Hey Doug,
           </p>
           <p>
            Appreciate the different perspective on this... and we've heard similar arguments before. Your post should not be dismissed, as we don't have any evidence that it is incorrect. Perhaps these are just a bunch of strange people that like to speak about pizza/hot dogs/food/handkerchiefs in very strange ways. That in and of itself is not a crime, agreed.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, if you are only looking at the text of his emails and using this to dismiss everything (or even simply dismiss the emails themselves), that is counterproductive. The simple fact that there is now a mountain of circumstantial evidence/links to other people/organizations paired with the larger geo-political/shadow war research being done by George Webb is frightening.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that the links we are making here on Voat are somehow seamlessly "fitting" into George Webb's video series is also very troubling. A very large and complex picture is coming into focus, with more connections/cover-ups/strange coincidences/censorship being added every single day.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, in summary, just like how PizzaGate was kicked off with some coded emails and relationships with Comet Ping Pong/Alefantis - neither Comet nor Alefantis nor Podesta's coded emails are the hub any longer. That ship sailed back in November. Since then we have all moved on to much larger connections between individuals, organizations and historical cover-ups that shed light on a MUCH larger problem. One that is impossible to deny, whether or not you prefer playing dominoes with cheese pizza or pasta at your heavenly hot dog stand in Hawaii.
           </p>
           <p>
            I bet those Hawaiin hot dogs are expensive! Perhaps you could order up $65,000 worth? Because that makes sense.

             The sentiment of this reply is the exact reason (sorry,  not giving benefit of the doubt to anyone) shills are out in troves trying to explain away things, especially now that we have this new "WL" drop which I wouldn't be surprised to find out has been created in response to all of our research.  Made to look "real, " etc.  We got a nice,  big influx of Kool aid drinkers as soon as it was announced.  Suspicious.  Which only makes me think we're on the right track with the original research.

            uh no. Maybe if (big if because my grandparents would never refer to me as 'further entertainment') they were even the kids' grandparents. but these are politicians ands "friends of the family" at best. Do you know anyone who would offer up their children as entertainment to their coworkers or friends?

            Yes, it really might turn out to be nothing but sycophants currying favor, but I would think LE could look around and find out.  Maybe they have and can't tell us?  But I am glad for the emails anyway because we have found problems way bigger than Skippy that are factual so it got us in the door to looking at the big problem of child trafficking.

            This was more or less a psy-op just to prove to myself how nasty and one sided this forum and PG followers can be.  I am on your side, I have been following this neurotically fior months and am a strong believer but there are some contradictions I see but also a lot that makes sense.

              Because I strongly believe in saving kids from harm and wiping out the elite and bringing national attention to the shadow govt but sometimes a piece of pizza is just a piece of pizza.

              4 months for me, Ive been holding off on this view of mine for a while kind of half hoping everyone was right about Podesta to bring shit down but I guess I've been dissapointed by the lack of traction with PG and Vault 7 being unrelated that I had to share this

             Interesting. I think a lot of the people here are conditioned to respond to obvious trolls and shills and so they're inclined to get nastier the longer we have to put up with them. I will note though that your post didn't technically break any rules and was not deleted even though we all obviously hated it! :)

            Where's the picture of John playing dominoes? Don't think I've seen it.
           </p>
           <p>
            You haven't explained the handkerchief with pizza related map.
           </p>
           <p>
            You haven't explained the 'changing strategy' by John Podesta when he sent Sandler a box of cheeses to be 'demolished'. Who speaks that way? And how does it matter what you've had for dinner when playing any game whatsoever?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, whipping someone with dominos making up the rules as you go, using the Podesta method? I've played a lot of dominos and never heard anyone speak of it that way. You don't make up the rules as you go that's nonsense to any serious player.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are only a couple of mails with dominos in them, all to the Sandlers (who are btw lying thieving parasitic subprime bailout profiteering scumbags). So no he's not some big fan of the game. Did you even really do a search yourself?
           </p>
           <p>
            The phrasing in the Luzzatto mail with kids in the pool for entertainment - well explain it away as old folks talk but I have never heard anyone speak about kids that way, young, old or elderly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Combine them all together and you haven't properly explained anything, in fact the odds of someone having innocuous emails from different parties all with these weird wordings are infinitesimally small.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't think you properly researched the issue, apart perhaps from the 14/fish picture. Which could still be ambivalent/symbolic, since they do love those ambiguities i.e. hiding in plain sight.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, keep those faux refutations coming if you have more. This could yet prove fruitful.

             You've never looked at a big juicy burger and said or thought I'm going to demolish that thing? When looking at  looked at a bunch of chicken wings when I'm starving I know I've personally said " I'm going to tear those up" Same concept. Once again though, I'm not trying to prove him innocent but just provide different possibilities/scenarios.....There are hundreds of pizza related maps circulating (Google image) if you are a huge fan of Italian food it would be a goofy present for someone to give him. Its just how casually they discuss it, like it really is just a hankerchief. Plus, just to add there are no instances where podesta has been caught using nasty language or sexual references in any of his emails.I searched every derogatory term known to man so you would think that if he was that blatant there would be some incriminating mention of something. And you are right, it was a picture of him playing poker. So I will delete that. My bad.

              To further your research, the handkerchief magically changes subject identifier in the email chain.
             </p>
             <p>
              Email #1 - I have a square cloth handkerchief  (black w/ white) left on the kitchen island.
             </p>
             <p>
              Email #2- The realtor found a hankerchief (I think it has a map. Seems pizza related).
             </p>
             <p>
              No mention of pizza, or a map in email #1. Yet, in email #2, Susaner has inserted both map and pizza-related into the email to John P. Curious?
             </p>
             <p>
              All that aside. What the hell does a hankerchief seems pizza-related even mean? Explain that?

              It's a black and white checkered handkerchief with a map on it that seems pizza-related. I dare you to find such a thing using google or any image search.
             </p>
             <p>
              I love Italy and it's cuisine. Have been there many times, never saw a pizzamap on a handkerchief.
             </p>
             <p>
              Should you find it though, you'd still have to explain why a realtor and after her a Sandler thought it important enough to even email him about it.
             </p>
             <p>
              As to demolishing cheeses, sure, could be a figure of speech even if the writer isn't that hungry for them atm. But what about the 'unannounced change of strategy'? Because those words were my real point here.
             </p>
             <p>
              As to Podesta's nasty language or sex refs, no they are not in the emails at least explicitly. I guess he leaves that to Skippy.
             </p>
             <p>
              Btw you haven't addressed the dominos issue and him supposedly being a 'huge fan'. Kindly do so or remove that refutation as well, because as it stands it is a very strange way to speak about that particular game.

            It would be really funny as in bizarre if he and his friends are innocent of pedophilia yet the citizen research has served to root out where and how children are being abused and trafficked. Podesta did get called out twice for being a pedophile enabler by Breitbart well before the WikiLeaks dropped. As others have said, there really are no probable or rational alternate explanations for these emails:

           <ol>

              Podesta is thanked for a lovely, tempting assortment of yummy cheeses, gets chided for changing the arrangement and is asked "do you think I'll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?"

             How could he not be innocent?
             <br/>
             All these emails and breitbarts tweets are damning.   And plus if all this is not true, why hasnt pedosta debunked the emails and started suing people for defamation of character and slander. 
If i was innocent of all charges id hire a good attorney or attorneys to clear my name. But he hasnt. Because hes as a guilty as sin.

            This is nuts. Sorry.   Spirit Cooking a silly fad?  What about the damage in the meantime?  Ha Ha.  Just plain funny.  Ho Ho.  What a lark.  Have a party mimicking (?) a dead body in a pool of blood.  We have all become brainwashed if we fall for this.  And!  I did not vote for Her either nor Him (although I am willing to give him a chance). The JP emails are so obvious.  They speak for themselves.  Just like you might think you can find explanations for all the ones listed above, you can also list reasons that they are highly suspect at best.  Not to mention all of the other evidence that we have found to incriminate him and his elite pedo friends.  I suppose that does not come into play. Those are my views.

            Regardless breitbart pretty much said it and then died. And then the technician to the autopsy mysteriously died. Those are red flags in my book.

             Breitbarts tweet was about the ACORN scandal going on at the same time in IMO the whole thing is a ridiculous scenario with a couple dressed up as a 1970's pimp and hooker walking into that office. If you're not familiar please look it up before making assumptions.

               Yes, Podesta worked for Acorn at the time.. Even Breitbarts associates confirm that is what the tweet is about. Do the research. And Fuck, I'm not saying Podesta is a good guy.

            this will be a problem, deciding which emails are code and which are not, the likes of CNN will jump on anything that could be interpreted different ways.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe the ambiguation in the emails is not going to be a problem as I think there will be (or already is) more evidence that wont be so easy to deny.

            I stopped at "there is not one that doesn't have a logical explanation"
           </p>
           <p>
            The email about the "pizza related" map may turn out to be innocent when more information is found but as of today it can't be exonerated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why not? Because Sandlers wife emails John Podesta about a handkerchief he forgot at the rental house they were staying in on Martha's Vineyard. The realtor had sent an email to her about someone forgetting a handkerchief. The realtor never mentions it might be "pizza related". Mrs Sandler adds that when she writes the email to JP.
           </p>
           <p>
            So there are two possibilities:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Mrs Sandler talked to the Realtor on the phone after she got the email about a forgotten handkerchief and the realtor said it was "pizza related".
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Mrs Sandler didn't talk with the realtor and put in "pizza related" all on her own.
           </p>
           <p>
            Number 1 is the most likely scenario but 2 can't be eliminated without further evidence.

              Doug the existence of maps or handkerchiefs with pizza on them is irrelevant.
             </p>
             <p>
              The words pizza and handkerchief have specific meanings to a Pedophile.
             </p>
             <p>
              What you're trying to say is there's no way Mrs Sandler could have ever meant anything other than the innocent use of "pizza" and "handkerchief".
             </p>
             <p>
              Unfortunately you can't do that. You can't dismiss a potential suspect merely because they're rich, old and white.
             </p>

              We don't do that here in America remember?

               I'm not dismissing, just offering another viewpoint based upon the ides that the easiest answer is usually the right one. Plus I don't 100% believethe verbal pedo code since it all pretty much comes from urban dictionary in which anyone can add or update and there are some pretty off the esll connotations in there where pretty much every word in the English language has deviant not peverted meaning

                And I'm not saying the Sandlers are guilty of anything. But they are hooked in with a lot of DC insiders and politicians. And we're learning here that one way to get them to do your bidding is get some good dirt on them like infidelity or pedophilia among a long list of taboos.

                As for the pedo word code it cuts both ways. Yes the meanings can change over time but they also could be salted into innocent email traffic so that if some deplorable shit-lords get suspicious you can go on to some interwebs comment section and brow beat people for even thinking a crime was committed.
