            They do not want people to know what is happening in Racine, Wisconsin because they use Racine as a model for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. We need to shine the light on Racine as use Racine as a model to expose the entire network of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Racine is a weak point in the entire network, and a way to prove that the FBI and DOJ are extremely corrupt and complicit to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. We can prove through Racine that the Rule of Law and Equal Protection Under the Law are officially dead, as are 1st and 4th amendment rights, and that the people we entrust to uphold our laws are abusing the law under the color of law in favor of an evil corrupt global agenda.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is relevant to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption because those who witnessed the brazen levels of criminal corruption in Racine went to the local authorities including the corrupt DA who was involved in his own cover up drunken hit and run scandal, the state authorities who are primarily freemasons and members of the Marquette mafia, and the FBI and DOJ only to have the investigations mishandled and thwarted at every level up to Loretta Lynch herself who was personally involved in stonewalling the cases once she realized the connections to elite businesses and foundations including but not limited to the Clinton Foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nearly all officials involved have resigned or announced resignation including the corrupt mayor. The last mayor was also corrupt and was too sloppy with his pedo problems and was arrested. There are other high profile pedo and trafficking cases involved, and it leads to both the RNC and DNC, and many foundations, NGOs and PACs including the Club for Growth. The international airport and harbor are closely controlled by those involved, and they have started a new organization as a cover for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption called the Fight to End Exploitation. This links to the corrupt church, corrupt law enforcement, corrupt businesses, corrupt universities such as Cornell, Penn State and Arizona State, and the mafia. It is also connected to Hillary Clinton, John McCain and Ashton Kutcher who is a freemason and Kabbalah front man, and they are all attempting to control the narrative and investigations into Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. They are also linked through the Emanuels in Chicago, DC and Hollywood.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those who are involved are part of secret societies and elite global networks, and are also involved in pedo crimes, satanic ritual abuse and murder, and extreme levels of local, state, national and Global Criminal Corruption. Racine is used as an experimental hub for Agenda 2030, and is the birthplace of related programs including sustainable development, community policing, social surveillance, racketeering, human trafficking, organ harvesting, dialysis and blood transfusions, sanctuary cities, vaccines, viruses, fake news, and education reform.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine is a main "root" of PIzzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, and some of the secret societies connected to Racine include Knights of Pythias, Knights of Malta, Pilgrims Society, Scottish Rite, Council of 13, Committee of 300, and Club of Rome.

              First, they are called Secret Societies for a reason. They don't post everything on CNN and wikipedia for you. Most recently, we had to point out to you the connection between SC Johnson and the development of the Art in Embassies program in the 1960s. Your response was that the White House was in DC, not Racine. You are an absurd, desperate, and delusional disinformation agent.
             </p>
             <p>
              Second, we have first hand witnesses and sources that will testify to what they witnessed if and when the time comes, including the relationships between those involved in secret societies and the networks of criminal corruption that link Racine to the bigger picture of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

              Third, the Committee of 300 is a product of the British East India Company's Council of 300. The East India Company was chartered by the British royal family in 1600. It made vast fortunes in the opium drug trade with China and became the largest company on earth in its time. The Committee of 300 is a very old secret society, founded in 1729 by the Black Nobility through the British East India Company to deal with international banking and trade problems and to support the opium trade. It is run by the British Crown. It comprises the whole world banking system and the most important representatives of Western nations. Through the Committee of 300, all banks are linked to the Rothschild's. The Committee is a very important part of the llluminati, and is placed high up in the Political Pyramid. Dr. John Coleman wrote a book called: 'Conspirators' Hierarchy: The Story of the Committee of 300'*^', which extensively explains the connection. It also includes a list of the 21 main targets of the llluminati and the Committee of 300. This is Agenda 21, which is now Agenda 2030, and the underlying theme of Agenda 2030 is Sustainable Development which was started in Racine, Wisconsin with the Bushes and Clintons.

              The British East India Company is also tied to the beginning of the Pilgrims Society. Racine is directly tied to the Pilgrims Society through John Jeffry Louis. The blood line connections are Rothschilds &gt; Rockefellers &gt; Reynolds &gt; Johnson. SC Johnson is also connected through Dow, Bayer and DuPont among others involved. "The son of a highly decorated British East India Company army general, Frederick Sleigh Roberts was born in India in 1832. Educated at Eton and Sandhurst, he served in many important British campaigns before going to South Africa to command the British forces in the Boer War. Although nominally retired as commander-in-chief of the British Army in 1905 with a £100,000 government gratuity (the equivalent of £8 million today), Roberts retained his imposing will over military affairs. The esteem in which he was held is reflected in the score of regimental honorary colonel posts he accepted, including such famous regiments as the Irish Guards, Sherwood Foresters and the Black Watch. He was the first president of the Pilgrims Society of Great Britain, a secretive organisation linking the very wealthy and privileged in America and Britain. Right up to 1914, Roberts played a highly significant role for the Secret Elite in selecting and shaping the military high command." - Hidden History: The Secret Origins of the First World War

              EquineLuvr is a known shill who is scared about Racine being exposed. Every single time we prove you wrong, you disappear only to pop up on another post saying the same lies.

              Do you want to solve and end Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, or do you want to enable it?
