Can a U.S. Senator be inviting Russian, Ukrainian, Syrian, and other foreign leaders to have discussions about National Security and other topics...all in private, while shutting off the press from attending? This doesn\'t seem right, but I\'m no expert. Either way...i\'m not surprised to see McCain hosting private meetings with a bunch of globalists.

            McCain is a #! $@er. He's on the Russia bandwagon but a cursory review of WL emails shows podesta and hrc/dnc were using his friendly relations with putin and the Russians as potential ammo against him in the elections.  Lying sob.

            Isn't there an underground there?  I remember a friend telling me something about all the head shops and the underground community and that it was great for those with asthma.. I think she said Sedona that it was sort of like Atlanta's but more intense.

            Looks likw collusion to me. Wow I am not surprised with anything in the world of the Dc political elite. It seems everything goes no limits no one follows the rules they just make sure its leaked if someone else does. Down right back stabbing kid killing pedo elites. They got to be put away or down..

            Yes they are in direct violation of the Logan Act I believe it is. Meaning our government cannot discuss foreign policy with other world leaders behind closed doors and not disclose what was said. Check out Bilderberg 2017 videos where they catch the Bilderbergers at the airport and how standoffish they are about it. Bilderberg is happening now June 1 to 3 in Chantilly Virginia. They have been meeting behind closed doors every year for 65 years now at different locations all over the world, this year happens to be in the USA. All about the New World Order bullshit!!

             There meetings should be talked about by anyone that is aware on blogs and on the internet whenever possible.  Included should be your info about the Logan Act.  The more people that know this the better.

            Can't believe there was zero coverage of this in the media. Oh wait, half of them were in attendance (Les Moonves, Carlos Slim). Some guests of note re PG:
- The Rothschilds (obviously)
- Ernie Allen (formerly of NCMEC)
- A few THORN people
- A few people linked with Georgetown (John Barrasso, John Bessler)
- Rep from a trucking company (David Berry, Swift Transportation) - why???
           </p>
           <p>
            Unrelated (?) but curious, they invited Putin enemy Mikhail Khodorkowsky and had a whole session devoted to how bad a guy Putin is.

            Looks like McCain is roping in even more family members this time around - Jimmy McCain just happens to be his son

            I wonder if there was a spike in missing children in the area prior to that meeting.  Rot-childs get awfully hunnggrry when they travel.

             How would we know without any form of accountability or oversight. I think it's safe to assume some sort of negotiation, or discussion of negotiation occurred. Otherwise, whats the point?

            Hi company/org. has a twitter page on the page if you check out who he follows it's a bunch of "stop sex trade" organizations. Strange considering him and his wife are rumored to be running a big part of the trafficking ring. Keep your enemies close I guess...

              I don't know how many black people you know or whether you were living under a rock for the past 2 years but there's a big difference between shooting a black person in the street and shooting a black person in the street just to harvest their organs.

              Rodney King got the shit beat out of him but he got to keep his organs. There's several orders of magnitude of difference between the two.

              Ah - Gabriel is talking about offshore wealth, not total wealth, the thought of which made me sit up.
             </p>
             <p>
              As a result, offshore wealth turns out to be extremely concentrated. By our estimate, the top 0.01% of the distribution owns about 50% of it.

             I wonder if the foreign agent registration law applies. I'm totally ignorant about international law but something doesn't sit right if a senator is running his own parallel Dept. of State. And of course the Merkels are just proxies for Angela.  The Obamas and Clintons and their cronies are just running a government in exile anyway.

              Led by soros. The hillary/podesta wikileaks emails are damning. I always suspected it, but could never prove that soros called the shots until I read those emails. A vote for Hillary is a vote for Soros.

            Way to spoil a beautiful area. Meanwhile, everybody is unglued cause the Donald just pulled out of Paris Climate Change Circus. Hey, maybe he's not controlled after all. This is the biggest threat to his person thus far. I forgot these. (((  ))))  Better?
           </p>
           <p>
            Climate change is about control of the masses but also something far more important to the World Shadow Government.

             Or Both... their false flags are becoming sloppier. The Ariana Grande concert, for example was quickly scrutinized  with parents of children's photos used as the killed came forward sayung their child is alive and well. Reports like that and the media (at least the US MSM) backed off quickly.

              That collage of children's photos was strange.  If it was a scam put together by a fake news site, why did only a few families come forth to say their kids were alive.?  Why not all of them?  Strange!

            One year the presenters on that list were very interesting and I can bet most on here will recognize most of them.  Some will surprise you as well. the two Merkels are related to Angela Merkel  others are Paul Wolfowitz  almost the entire clan of McCains and many mixed Repubs and Dems.  Remember they are all in this together and plotting together.  Although it would be quite a job, it might be interesting researching their orgs. and positions.
