Serengeti Rabies Vaccination program recognition by the Gates Foundation of rabies as a priority disease for
control and elimination.
As a result of the mass dog vaccination campaigns that she directed and implemented (which now
involve vaccination of 200,000 dogs annually), Dr Cleaveland’s work has not only prevented hundreds
of human and animal rabies deaths in the Serengeti. Over the past 15 years, Dr Cleaveland’s research work has been centred in northern Tanzania,
focusing on the epidemiology of infectious disease at the human-wildlife-domestic animal interface,
including rabies, canine distemper, bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis and echinococcosis.

            A few especially promising projects spread food pellets laced with vaccines, similar to the blocks of treated fishmeal that have been used to control raccoon rabies in the U.S. Some of the food pellets also include sterilizing contraceptives to reduce numbers of unvaccinated newborns and shrink the size of stray populations.

            Can you provide a source showing that FBIanon said that?  We need to remember that FBIanon also told us part of his method of avoiding detection by unfriendly agents was to mix in nonsense ("noise") with the rest of what he was saying.  I don't see any evidence in any of this that she was onto anything.  She was severely depressed and had bipolar disorder.  She had to move into a different apartment because her roommates were too weirded out by her.  Ockham's razor at this point says she had a depressive/psychotic episode and found her way to the roof via the fire escape, then into the water tank.

           <p>
            ELISA is the acronym for this type of test.  It's a very common acronym in hospital labs.  This is the kind of crazy nonsense we need to avoid.

             Why were her roommates too weirded out by her?  Anything specific?  It bothers me that so many are quick to blame her death on bipolar disorder and depression.  That area and even the hotel were pretty rough places.
