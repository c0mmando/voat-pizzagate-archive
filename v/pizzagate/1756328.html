            , I am sad that you are so frustrated and feeling so hopeless. It is NOT the intent of any mod on this sub to make any user feel that way. Some mods struggle with this feeling themselves, especially when people repeatedly refuse to respect the guidelines the community developed in order to focus the subverse on evidence-backed research posts that document the nasty shit the establishment elite have inflicted on the world. We have a place you can vent about this -- it's called
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods">
             v/pizzagatemods
            </a>
            . There are plenty of people doing so. Instead, you chose -- knowingly -- to slap an unsourced discussion post up here, where we HAVE TO REMOVE IT. I know you know this, because it's what your post was removed for earlier.
           </p>
           <h3>
            Deliberately violating the rules and then claiming mods are part of the pizzagate censorship machine when they do their jobs and take it down is a shill tactic designed to disrupt the investigation and sow discord in the community. Is that how you want folks to think of you here?
           </h3>
           <p>
            The submission guidelines are the only way we have to remove forum-sliding shitposts submitted in the dozens every day by paid operatives to keep well-documented material from being accumulated here. We have to enforce them consistently.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please review the community-established submission guidelines for

             Each subverse has its own rules which are usually stated in the respective subverse's sidebar. If you ignore said rules, your account may be banned from submitting further content to the subverse or in some cases, globally.

            I'm working on custom forum software that'll be dedicated to global scale investigation and (circumstantial) evidence collection. Much like here on VOAT, just without trigger-happy complicit mods.

            Try one of my favorite political figures and author of "People's History of US" - - Howard Zinn
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “TO BE HOPEFUL in bad times is not just foolishly romantic. It is based on the fact that human history is a history not only of cruelty, but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness.
What we choose to emphasize in this complex history will determine our lives. If we see only the worst, it destroys our capacity to do something. If we remember those times and places—and there are so many—where people have behaved magnificently, this gives us the energy to act, and at least the possibility of sending this spinning top of a world in a different direction.
And if we do act, in however small a way, we don’t have to wait for some grand utopian future. The future is an infinite succession of presents, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is ba
d around us, is itself a marvelous victory.” 
― Howard Zinn

            "Sentimentality without action is meaningless."

           <p>
            He also reminds us that Slavery -- a system protected by our own Founders in the Constitution (while proclaiming "All are equal"( --
was overturned.
           </p>
           <p>
            That most of us immediately recognize that the US government's war on the native Americans and the theft of this land was immoral and unjust -- and set new precedents of violence.  And that that war on Native Americans by Elites/wealthy continues on today.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look too to the non-violent campaign of women to end their oppression which has gone on tens of thousands of years.
           </p>
           <p>
            And to the successful non-violent campaign of African Americans to end Segregation in the US which existed 100 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Recently, a non-violent campaign by gays and lesbians created friends out of enemies -- where even their own families and Mothers and Fathers had been taught to fear and hate them by organized patriarchal religion.
           </p>
           <p>
            In other words, if we want revolution -- and it should only be non-violent - look to the oppressed among us for the brilliance and intelligence required.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have to stop cooperating with capitalism and the time to do that effectively may soon come to an end as Elites/Wealthy gain total control over our government, it's wealth and natural resources.  No longer would they have to steal directly from the public, no longer would "bus-I-ness" be necessary.  They would have the government and full access to our tax dollars.
           </p>
           <p>
            What's left now is to end this war on Nature -- Women and Children, Seniors, the helpless among us --
           </p>
           <p>
            The public must come to understand the reality of patriarchy and organized patriarchal religion and to stop supporting these male-supremacist organizations.

            Yup, they have done it to many of us and gave bogus reasons for the deletion that did not add up. Other times, no excuse was given. Then I see shill threads guilty of what they accused mine of that are at the top of the page. The mods also get in personal battles and on occasion have mocked people as "conspiracy theorist". The mods are compromised. Keep pushing forward.

            My thread on trying to red pill natural Trump supporters through the pulpit kept getting deleted. We need to share what we have discovered by any means that will not discredit the movement. Why not target those at a grass root level who have a sense of right and wrong? The MSM have failed us.  Mainstream investigative journalism is compromised. Would Water-gate have seen the light of day without the Washington Post?

            "deleting substantive discussions" --- Your post was opinion and conversation, not factual and not bringing new information which actually could lead to the action you want.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want pizza/pedogate to actually get results, then [we all have to] work on digging for info and pour the effort into it that it takes to write a substantive post that might help. I'm really sick to death of checking in on voat to see threads without actual leads/information upvoated like crazy in some ridiculous popularity contest, while "boring" posts with SERIOUS INFORMATION and GOOD LEADS are ignored and slid off the front page by ^^^^^^ unsubstantive content.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example. Judicial Watch released new Huma Abedin emails today. That story got to the front of reddit. Here, it got maybe 13 votes. I think the pizzagate voat community should be ashamed of that. Mods should have every right to delete threads that don't contribute to the investigation. I do not envy them their position in having to both fight shills and then defend every decision they make - if they tread on ONE PERSON's feelings they are suddenly shills. And that creates an atmosphere where nothing can be deleted, which allows shills to slide the entire sub really badly.
           </p>
           <p>
            We all need to get thicker skins. It's not about us, it's about the kids. Did your first post help the investigation? No? Then the mods were right to delete it.

            <p>
             C. The materials on Anthony weenies laptop seen and saved by the NYPD and also currently in poession of the FBI
            </p>

              If you are referring to the same corrupt authorities perpetrating these activities...
             </p>
             <p>
              "They" will never prosecute this because "they" are the ones operating this as a business.
             </p>
             <p>
              All of what you pointed out is evidence of this. That's why the Brian Podesta/NCMEC/ and Arun Rao/DOJ leads were so highly censored. Because the DOJ, child "protective" services and sources of authority which are supposed to prosecute these crimes ARE the ones perpetrating and orchestrating them.
             </p>
             <p>
              Are you expecting them to willingly prosecute themselves? Why do you think an investigator got killed over the Franklin coverup when they had too much evidence?
             </p>
             <p>
              The people in power have zero interest in "damaging evidence" beyond hiding it.
             </p>
             <p>
              That is the reality. Now what are we going to do about it.

              They have all the evidence. I think the problem is that all of the agencies and people who should be investigating this are part of the problem, and they doing everything they can to protect the human trafficking industry. What we must do is continue to spread the word in whatever ways we can, and raise public awareness of the situation until such time as the awareness reaches a critical mass. We need more numbers, and that takes time. We will cultivate patience and perseverance and continue the good fight.

            I have a question for everyone. Does anyone understand the CCP system? I'm curious what warrants a comment contribution point and have noticed that mine have hovered in the neighbourhood of 100 without breaking through to the point at which I might downvote what I consider shill shitposts. I can see my CCP go up after I post a comment somewhere, can see my total upvotes given rise, but can find no record of any upvotes, or at least nowhere near as many as i'm being credited with, actually visible in the threads in which I post. And then my CCP will drop again as much as it rose before slowly and gradually plodding forward a point or so for a half dozen comments. But it's disproportionate to my invisible upvotes. I feel paranoid even saying this but i'm curious what gives? I don't say obnoxious stuff very often. i don't distract from the investigation, and when i offer my theories or opinions, i express them as such. So why am I just not able to break the 100CCP barrier? Anyone else having a similar experience here?

            i realize the mods have a tough job and its a fine line between keeping us on track and allowing for some more general discussions, but it does seem like some threads get deleted when they don't need to be. sometimes its better to allow the op to edit to be within the rules then to delete the thread and suggest that they make a new one.

            Completely agree and I love your righteous anger. Please mods stop deleting these threads, they are needed. I go to sleep every damn night thinking about these poor children getting abused by the whole sick and rigged system and there's nothing I can do. I feel drained but I don't want to let them down. There has been enough fucking madness in this world. Enough satanic rituals, human sacrifices, murders, rape, child rape, child abuse, blackmail, death threats, sex trafficking and all their other disgusting crap! ENOUGH!
           </p>
           <p>
            Good shall prevail on the Earth. The vast majority of human beings want to live a quiet and happy life close to their friends and family. They want to laugh, dance, play, smile, create, play music... you know, normal things like that? When you are not mentally ill you don't want to sacrifice babies and drink their blood (i.e Hampstead children), you pick a guitar or watch a movie instead. The thing is these mentally ill people RUN THE WORLD right now... their perverted minds are brainwashing the decent human beings living today. Through their media they are telling us what to think, what to buy, what to wear, who to believe, who to love, who to hate. They infiltrated all aspects of our world. This is a total takeover and we must get out of this mess together.

             Maybe then, all of you filled with righteous fury and anger [as I am too] should channel it into research and substantive posts. That might help. Because I don't see the handles of substantive posters bitching in here right now. They are actually doing something about this.

            is one of the better sources for research and info (and still growing in subscribers thanks, in part, to those who post about voat in comment sections) and if this sub can be made to be so toxic and confusing, people will try to find alternatives... only to return. Making Philip II of Macedon very proud of his divide and rule/conquer tactic. It's largely psychological, I've noticed. It's the end result that they are going for -- people will defeat themselves by not posting. I must say their strategy seems to be working, unfortunately. /pol/sters have a pretty good tactic I've noticed -- bombard the board with posts and don't let up. I just try to deal with it because this is still one of the better boards for this.

             The sliding has definitely taken an upswing over the past few weeks. Have also seen an upswing in awareness though. Definitely been an increase in random people willing to voice their disdain at truth suppression online.

            On that note, I was reading the comments section of a thread expressing just this very frustration and intended to upvote what I felt was an insightful and well put comment when I discovered it had been deleted. It had 9 upvotes and no downvotes when i was reading it so I can't explain it. Here it is:

            "There was a comment on voat today about a child porn ring in Punjab pakistan. Looking into the wiki page thebudual story was told. Hundreds of kids, videos, blackmail, bullshit response by police and politicians until the riots began.
           </p>

            In about 30 days it will be 6 months or rape and torture of kids, so let me post a few questions and statements.
           </p>
           <p>
            What if there are pedos in high level at local state and federal police then what?
           </p>
           <p>
            What if high level entertainment industry, media, news folks are involved or being blackmailed into silence?
           </p>
           <p>
            Who watches the watchers? What if the people who are to protect, prosecute and inform have been infiltrated from the ground up?
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember Jimmy saville was taking kids out of hospital beds and raping them in the basement along with doctors and nurses present. One victim talked about robes and masks being used like some form of ritual.
           </p>
           <p>
            Prime Minister Ted Heath who was accused raping and killing kids is being investigated and the findings will be kept secret. MI6 and MI5 had no idea about saville who was friends with the royals or the prime minister?
           </p>
           <p>
            Breitbart, Hastings, Nancy Schaefer, Ben Swann nuking his social accounts, Alex Judas Jones shutting up, Corey Feldman afraid to name names. What could be so dark and deadly that people are afraid to speak out? Could these people be so organized and intertwined into every part of life? The military delay tactic is being used. Every week it's "next week xyz is going to happen". This gives the rapist more time to organize and neutralize.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've noticed over the years the fear porn peddler Alex Judas Jones always shuts down a guest who wants to pose activist solutions. Judas Jones interrupts and tries to steer the conversation back to "let's keep talking about the bullshit". Ive heard Aaron Russo and David Icke tell him to flat out shut up and stop interrupting. The strategy is to just keep people talking about how terrible shit is just like AJ does. A conspiracy echo chamber. JFK had his head blown off in the middle of the street on Live TV and NOTHING HAPPENED. Movies, thousands of books, declassified documents.... still poppa bush walks free.
           </p>
           <p>
            Singer Marilyn Manson has a spiral heart tatoo on his damn wrist, tell me he knows nothing?
           </p>
           <p>
            Say what you want about David Icke. It he's been 100% about the pedos for 20 years. Entertainers, lawyers, judges, cops, firemen, famous athletes, people who we consider heros.... all involved.
           </p>

            We must take this offline guerilla tactics. Magic marker bathroom stalls, bumper stickers on stop signs. I saw a 9/11 inside job graffiti on a hiway sign for one of the busiest roads in the north east. Stayed there for 10 years, dude must be able to levitate. Is this going to be another conspiracy people talk about for 50 years while 10s of millions of kids are raped to death and eaten? Or is this the conspiracy to end all conspiracies. We must all decide now."

             I've noticed that this happens ALL THE TIME. I can't count the number of times I've come on Voat to read the posts and can't upvote or comment because it's already been deleted or archived. It's ridiculous.

              I felt their last paragraph offered some ways to both vent said frustration and to hopefully pave the road for the red-pilling of others. Guerilla tactics or not, seemingly effective or not, it's not insignificant. I'm also curious why this submission was deleted.

            Even though infiltrated and sabotaged by its own mods, this subverse is still great.  Every day I learn something significant here.  And look at the steady growth; we just broke the 13,000 subscriber mark.

            Has anyone noticed the dwindling numbers. Posts that are hot have very few upvoats. It is like they are being surpressed or half of the community has left?

             You are catching on. I had a thread that had 18 upvotes in about 15 minutes in the early hours, they kept deleting it. The looking at the front page their were absurd shill threads about cartoonish youtube nobodies yelling at the screen. The Mods need to be swept out and replaced.

             The shittiest posts get massive upvoats. Substantial posts get very very few, regularly. Classic example was today when Judicial Watch released a new set of Huma Abedin emails and that thread got about 13 votes in a number of hours - whereas it was at the front page of reddit. That is either pathetic on our part as a community, or shillbots are mass spamming the worst threads possible with upvoats specifically to slide the sub

              You are encouraging them to continue their conduct. This is a war. You should know by now they are all about corrupting from within. This is what you have to deal with. Deal with it and keep moving forward.

              Did you delete this thread? You need to provide a good reason for that, though truthfully, there isn't one. We are all stressed to the hilt as this poster so eloquently explained and you fuckers go and delete shit left and right as if you were actually people that mattered at all in this sub. No one knows who you are, you're not more qualified than most others here, you got this position by chance/luck and you fucking lord over all of us to the point of deleting good and useful threads. Seriously, fuck you people. You will burn in hell for this shit.

              I'll also try and do a better job of defending you guys a bit. It reminds me of being a referee in the soccer match. Both teams always think you're wrong no matter which call you make lol. A thankless job for sure so I would like to say THANK YOU :) I love this place :)

              I honestly think its a lack of true awareness of rules that generates majority of mod mistrust. Most new people that aren't familiar with the rules might have just stumbled into all this rubbish and then they vent that into a post that breaks one of the rules and than BAM all that anger is redirected to mods. Of course with the sheer volume of rubbish you have to wade through it's surely taxing. Anyways.... just a thank you and hope you don't let peoples misguided energy wear you down :D

             That is what they intend. Keep pushing. They ban your screen name, make another. Reddit was trashed and now this place has become rehash heaven with a heavy dose of shills and deletion of legit threads.

             That's really sad. It shouldn't be like that. If anything we need give people more incentive to participate, to want to participate and to want to contribute and join our ranks.

             because i tell you man, this topic is such that, lest your heart is really truly in it and nothing else matters, you won't last. It's too fucking heavy. There's opposition facing you in every direction on this issue.

             I feel as if, we are literally having to climb the Holy Mountain, whilst the entire horde of the bottom most pits of hell is clutching our feet and pulling us down from reaching the summit and seeing with our eyes finally, the glory which lies, awaiting us, on the other side of the mountain top.
            </p>
            <p>
             And when I say glory, I'm talking about the smiles on the little faces of those whom the world has forgotten and abandoned to a fate worse than that of a carrion being fed on by vultures.

              And now ti's been deleted. The mods go through and delete stuff when no one's looking, even after a hundred comments from the community. Who are they protecting? It's supposedly to keep the sub from getting clogged, but bullshit. This is straight up big brother style censorship.

              It's important to take breaks to recharge the soul. We aren't build to process high volumes of negativity (at least i'm not) whereas the folks we're going after feed off of it.

              Take a time out and get back in the fucking game bro we need you and we need everybody to keep researching, keep posting, keep spreading awareness.

            It was a meta post and was deleted on those grounds.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, I think the odd, constructive meta discussion (as opposed to concern trolling, which your post didn't appear to be) should be given some leeway, but that's just my opinion and I'm not a mod, so don't have that say. I also think some meta organization posts should get a bit more slack (ie. memes, coordinating where and when to rally, how to get the ball rolling faster, etc.).
           </p>
           <p>
            You shouldn't have an issue posting in pizzagatewhatever, though, FWIW.

             this..... we should have a bit of leeway for meta discussions because for certain personality types (like mine) it really helps fuel the overall understanding of where people are at and injects the human element. People don't want to sit at home and code all day, we want to go outside and play soccer as well.... soak up some sun

               IMO this would be helpful. Would still allow categorization, but while ensuring everyone can see and discuss relevant materials. This would also make it easier for the general community to see and determine matters of importance.
