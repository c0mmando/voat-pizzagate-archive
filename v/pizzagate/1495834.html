            Although this is the type of thing I would say when I was late teen/early 20's, using "destroy" or "demolish" would mean we ate it quickly because we liked it so much or had munchies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pasta, chicken, eggs, and beans are basically my core staple foods so I tend to be more skeptical than others when it comes to where these words are being used with their sinister meanings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some things to consider here are that it is Dec 23, and gift baskets of exotic/rare cheese/meats are a common gift. At least it was when I was a kid and we would get gifts from friends/relatives/other businesses we worked with. I remember this because we would have a ton of fancy cheese/meats/salmon/cracker and chocolate baskets after christmas and I got sick of them.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this does not hold any relation to the keywords alternate meanings, then I would say that he is talking about saving the treats for when his grandkids come home. He enjoys playing the traditional game of dominoes with them (an older persons game) and is saving them for the occasion.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the keywords are their sinister form, them I would read this as he has received children as a gift and he is saving them to use with his grandkids. Maybe this means he is going to use them to further their MK Ultra programming by torturing/killing them in front of the grandkids.
           </p>
           <p>
            The part that seems out of place are the first sentences:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been
long in place. I immediately realized something was different by the shape
of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the
square shaped box.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This is the part that makes me think there is an alternate meaning to the keywords. I was trying to think of a way to explain that legitimately and the best I could come up with is that he liked the pasta/sauces that he received in the past christmas gifts and this was his way of kind of hinting at that without being a jerk. Most older folks I know are "old fashioned", they have a different way of thinking/talking/etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            The description of the box seems weird to me as well. What shape do boxes of "pasta" normally come in? Square boxes which are put into square shipping boxes, right? I suppose he could of been expecting a "basket" shaped gift but IME when shipping these they come in a box. Unless they used some local delivery service that does that kind of thing - flowers/gift baskets/etc.

            In a world where he is actually talking about real cheese, demolish would mean he is just going to eat them all. Demolish would imply they are very good and he is going to stuff his face with the cheese.
