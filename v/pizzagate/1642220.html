            I just noticed how he is subscribed to Tikkun emails, however the one you have is from shul - the other ones are from magazine for his subscription...I knew there would be something deeper with his tikkun ties, this is helpful but I still feel it needs some more substance

               I think it's actually "Good" to have "People who are focused" looking into different area's of the same overall topic. If your focus will be on "Tikkon" that's a good thing and 1 thing off the checklist. I stumbled across what I found looking into a different area. Hopefully, it helps someone else corroborate what their focus is on. As I see it did with you. Im focused on 2 things right now. "The cards" we were told to follow is one of my focus's. I am on page 15 of "Cards"-----&gt;Wikileaks-----&gt;Podesta files right now of 49 pages. Found "Some stuff" but nothing damning. Unless "The Cards" we were supposed to be looking at, were "Gift Cards" then there's a shit ton I found. Also, found "Elite" Credit Card where they only made "2" and Tony Podesta had both.

               But honestly, the wordcorpo videos have me side-tracked as well. Im literally on the verge of teaching myself a portion of reverse-forensics to find out "Where exactly" the vid's were made.
              </p>
              <p>
               Keep me up-to-date with anything you find on "Tikkon" and I'll keep you up to date with anything I find on human/organ trafficking.

               <p>
                I'm REALLY curious if those videos or those other "shock" videos we have found over the past few months - like weird commercials/music videos - how many will go back to Marfa since they have all those abandoned homes.
               </p>
               <p>
                Right now I'm doing something on Marfa - I probably won't follow up more with it after this for a while, since so many people are following the new leads - but then I'm really hung up on two people I think might be key but the internet has almost nothing on them which is really, really strange. From there once I can finally put a lid on these two people then I can link it back up with Tikkon or is it Tikkun..but I only found that out because of something that was linked from Marfa...so if this would play out how I would like it to, it could be something solid...but I'm chasing straws but I have a good feeling about it.
I hate saying good feeling...I wish none of us were on here..I wish none of this was real. I wish ONE person would just fess the fuck up and be punished but bring down the whole operation..like come on.

                 I don't know what marfa is, Redpill me.  But the more "Dedicated Investigators" keep digging. The more ties we find that connect with someone else's personal investigation. It may not help what we personally were "Looking for".....but may be very important to what another anon is "Looking at".

            Did you see the second to last picture when you scroll down? That kid drew what looks to be a garden full of pizza slices (unless that's a tomato plant or something?). There's a lot on that picture and I can't make it all out.

             That's if he was there. I just find it odd that that's the address that he gave (The intersection) only had 2 things he would play a part in, and they are both attached. The pizza shop, and "The New Shul". When the "Shul" was tied to human and organ trafficking. This isn't just a pedo hunt. This is way bigger. Human Trafficking, Organ Trafficking, Child Prostitution, Quite Literally "Slavery", Sacrifice, Torture, and Satanic Rituals. Gotta look at the bigger picture to see it all.

              Most of my research is in Haiti that may very well have all of those elements. I keep it to the human trafficking mainly, though, because that is easiest to prove.

            They are Kabbalah, another name for Babylonian Talmud ----&gt; branch of Egypt fusion ----&gt; adopting the branch of 33 degree masonry ---&gt; theosophical society, etc.
            <br/>
            This group is ancient, regardless of  the new name or branch of factions.   History has shown thousands of years ago they infiltrated Judaism and the Jews were told to stay clear of them.  Jews were either killed or cast out in the diaspora,  left to dwindle.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is error to give these ones the title of Jews.  Why do you people continue to perpetuate uneducated information?

           <p>
            I really wish people would crack open the Torah if their going to misuse the Jewish name - otherwise you're perpetuating thousands of years of divisiveness which has always used the Jews, and other groups like  #BlackLivesMatter as a shield and front or cover-up to hide behind.

             I was just quoting the article. I even stated "I was quoting the article". And up to date on all of this. Click my profile and see the stuff I post. In fact YOUR actually wrong. This goes back even further than you state. At least to ancient egypt. BUT in their claims, this goes back to Adam and "Lillth" as per their beliefs. Lillth was supposedly Adams 1st wife before eve was made from his rib. "Lillth" is also "Minerva" the "Owl" from Bohemian Grove. But you are correct about this having "Masonic Rites and Rituals". Just much deeper than that. When you realize the "Masons" worship the "Light Bringer" or dun dun dun Baal/Lucifer.

             Also, offended jewbro. There are different types of Judaism....you know that right? The bad kind are the "Ashkenazi Kabbalists" and "Zionist".

              I was  pointing out the people who lump all Jews together, and there are many.
              <br/>
              It was probably late in the night so I could understand missing that distinction, but  writing   "Jews in Israel"  is a sweeping generalization that is not specific --- like I said.   There are many Jews in Israel who are not Babylonian Talmud-Kabbalah-Zionists.    It would be like saying  all men are pedo's, or all gays are,  and this is an omission of distinction, which in your case has failed to make that distinction of  ''Jews  in Israel".   I see a lot of people doing this.  It's an error. How would you like it if someone took your dominant nationality, or your gender, and made a broad sweeping statement that lumped you with a group of corrupt men?
             </p>
             <p>
              I did mention the heritage of  Babylon (Babylonian Talmud)  via  Egyptian fusion.
             </p>
             <p>
              Did you know the name  Ashkenazi also falls into this usurp agenda?   The Jews were cast out in the diaspora, via  infiltrated  Babylonian and Egyptian groups into the Jewish sect (Kabbalah,  Theosophy, modern Masonry, etc) .  The Jews were cast out,  Vatican and Jesuits took over, along with the remaining group who were already infiltrated into  ancient 2,000 yr old  Judea/Israel.
              <br/>
              Hitlers  term NAZI, was  a clever reference toward  AshkeNAZI, while working with the Vatican (who are a branch of  Babylonian/Egyptian) and the entire Jewish nation who were displaced through the diaspora were labeled and usurped as a cover to shield and protect them against  critique.    Zionism is the more modern name, which has been lumped with the name Ashkenazi to further smear the entire Jewish population.
             </p>
             <p>
              To say there are different types of Judaism but use the term  "Jews in Israel"  is a contradiction of non-specificity of which I've detailed.   I made the same mistake as you before someone set me right, but unlike you I was very thankful for their correction and have been careful about the distinction ever since....  cause  I wouldn't appreciate it if someone did the same thing to me.

               Im part Jewish bro....your argument carries zero bearing to me. I understand the distinction between the different sects of Judaism. (Ashkenazi, Zionist, Conservative, and Orthodox/Ultra Orthodox)  I also understand that the good Jews are starting to stand heavily against the bad ones (Notice the Israeli dump on 200k missing kids from the 60's a month ago). None of this negates the fact that, these things tie together. Where people who have been "Convicted" of trafficking of humans and organs have named them. Their Race/Religion is non important to me. However the correlation between the traffickers &amp; the "Shul" is.

                Also, I understand what you were trying to say about the basis of labeling Israel as all jews in Israel. But also, NOT my fault. That is the very statement that was "Quoted".....it literally says "Quoted" before it. I copy/pasted the statement from the article that involved him saying who was involved. 
Gotta let go of being sensitive bro
Sensitivity is cause to "Cognitive Dissonance"

               I made the distinctions between Ashkanazi, Zionist, Orthodox &amp; Conservative in my reply last time btw. Did you read it? Or are you trying to just "Pull the race card" in an effort to distract? If so, that's also a huge
