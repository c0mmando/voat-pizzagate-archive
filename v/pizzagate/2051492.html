            Here's a good summary of Elsagate from a Steemit post:
            <a href="https://steemit.com/elsagate/@theouterlight/what-is-elsagate">
             https://steemit.com/elsagate/@theouterlight/what-is-elsagate
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            If you watch any of the videos (not recommended) on YouTube, you will find all kinds of cryptic comments in the comments section, much of it clearly coded language.
           </p>
           <p>
            A common conclusion is that these videos are part of a government/inter-government intelligence operation (e.g., MK Ultra, Monarch). These videos are a means of communicating between the brainwashers and their subjects. This explains the completely bizarre themes, the bizarre comments, the wildly exaggerated subscriber numbers, and also the reason these videos have not been taken down. (What else can explain why, despite the public outcry, YouTube will not delete these videos and ban the publishers.)
           </p>
           <p>
            It's also clear that this operation is global. Even if the nexus is in the USA, their agents/ops are located around the world (the Awan brothers are a another good example of how US intelligence is using foreign operatives to conduct their projects), and funding can come from many sources/channels, obviously including banks.
           </p>
           <p>
            Honeybee's investigation has revealed that many of these videos are being produced in the Czech Republic and perhaps tied to European banks:

             https://www.bitchute.com/video/7gXJCOvypJI/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I have also noticed in the comments section of these videos many commenters saying "It's Ethan" or "Diss Ethan". Trying to understand this I came upon this group on YouTube, whose creators are Ethan and Hila Klein:
            <a href="http://www.h3h3productions.com/">
             http://www.h3h3productions.com/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H3h3Productions">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H3h3Productions
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            H3H3 is more weird stuff, but it may be just weird and nothing pedo, But some viewers of the Elsagate videos obviously think these guys may be behind them. Even if there is no link between the two, I will at least say the artwork of the one of the H3H3 team is suspect. You be the judge:

             Thanks for providing evidence, this is among the first I've ever seen. But this obviously doesn't scratch the surface, and it's remarkable how this was only able to be gleaned from a shipping label inadvertently displayed and the source was tracked down to somewhere in the Czech Republic. Because many of these videos are clearly produced in the US, the faces of the actors and actresses are plainly visible, there's high quality footage of their surroundings and locations, there's even license plates visible in that video I posted, and yet- why is there scarcely any information on these people? People were able to track down the location of Shia Labeouf's HWNDU flags in less than 24 hours, they were able to track down within a few days that antifa bike lock attacker after his second series of assaults, and yet this whole thing, which has tens of thousands of videos behind it, massive manipulation of viewcounts and subscriber counts, with tons of high quality footage more blatant than the cloud and flight patterns of the sky on a webcam- it's still some great mystery as to who and what is producing this shit?
            </p>
            <p>
             That for all intents and purposes is more baffling to me than why Youtube refuses to do anything about it. I'm not insinuating anything conspiratorial with this, I just don't understand why there seems to be this pervasive, long-running indifference or ineptitude or what have you with people tracking down the groups and people behind all of this. Of course, maybe I just haven't looked hard enough, but wherever I have looked, it's just the same confusion and befuddlement, almost completely devoid of any actual doxx on the sick fucks behind this.
            </p>
            <p>
             Though really, why is Youtube refusing to do a thing about this? What have their responses been exactly? Everywhere I look this whole thing just baffles the fuck out of me, I've never seen anything like this. This massive global operation of depraved, fetishized, and grotesque videos marketed to children- and next to nothing seems to be done about it.

            I know those Elsa videos have the male character dressed in a spiderman costume.  There are many of these videos and millions of views each, yet no lawsuits to 'cease and desist'.

            It's obvious mind control or psychological warfare of some sort.  There was an episode where she was going to have a baby I think and shot herself in the stomach with a needle and was all better.  I think there is something very subversive about these.  The target audience must be about 5-10, would be my guess.

             Disney owns both of those characters. They are also very litigious about their copyrights. I would expect their lawyers to be all over this. Makes you wonder why they aren't...

            That video is beyond dumb and of no value at all to children.  The violence is unbelievable for small children and that is who will be watching this.  Parents do not watch videos with their children anymore like they used to watch the cartoons.  I remember when I was little I used to watch cartoons with my brother, I was quite a bit older than he was. Then my mother would join us after cleaning up the dishes.  This is why kids are watching these.  If no one watched, there would be no market for them.
