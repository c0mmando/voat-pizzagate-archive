<p>Nebraska, a case study:</p>
<p>From Feb 7, 2017: <a href="http://nebraska.tv/news/local/sex-for-sale-in-nebraska-human-trafficking-hidden-in-plain-sight">Sex for sale in Nebraska: Human trafficking hidden in plain sight</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>NEBRASKA (NTV) — Right now, there is sex for sale somewhere in Nebraska. It’s a crime that plays out in parking lots, at truck stops, in hotels and homes; but <strong>it’s not always between two consenting adults</strong>, like we see with prostitution.</p>
<p>Instead, experts say it’s often human trafficking, someone being held prisoner and forced into a life they never wanted to be a part of.</p>
<p>“Where it’s red there’s really a huge demand, and there’s Hastings and Grand Island, there’s demand for sex there,” said Anna Brewer, who worked with the FBI for 20 years.</p>
<p>Research done by Creighton University, shows that sex is advertised online in nearly every part of the state.</p>
<p>“To think that the community you live in, Kearney, Lexington, Grand Island; there’s demand for sex there,” said Brewer. “If there was no demand, the traffickers would not bring these girls to these small rural areas.”</p>
<p>For 6 years, Brewer led the FBI’s Omaha Child Exploitation Task Force, and investigated sex trafficking cases across the country. She says gone are the days of people circling blocks looking for sex; today, you can scroll through ads on your phone and pick a human being to buy.</p>
<p>“<strong>80% of sex trafficking happens on the internet</strong>. It’s not the traditional walking the street like it used to be,” said Brewer.</p>
<p>According to research done by Creighton University, funded by the Women’s Fund of Omaha, there are <strong>900 people for sale online every month in Nebraska</strong>, and almost all of them are female. </p>
<p>[And from an earlier <a href="http://www.ketv.com/article/incredible-video-shows-rescue-of-teen-from-icy-maine-lake/8800364">article</a>, &quot;The Creighton Human Trafficking Initiative has identified <strong>over 2,200 human beings for sale in Omaha</strong>&quot;]</p>
<p>“The <strong>ads will use words as fresh, new, new meat, virgin; words like that to insinuate that they’re young</strong>,” said Brewer. “<strong>That speaks to the demand</strong>. Who do the buyers want? Often times they identify them as being 18, because that’s the barley legal age to be able to post online. When we see 18, that’s a huge indicator that it could be someone underage.”</p>
<p>Men and women exploiting strangers; and <strong>even parents selling their own kids</strong> right here in central Nebraska.</p>
<p>Back in 2013, a Franklin County mother was sentenced to 80 years in prison for trafficking her two children to her boyfriend and people she met online.</p>
<p>In May of 2012, Michelle Randall put a personal ad on Craigslist offering female companionship in the Kearney area. She then offered the sexual services of her <strong>14-year-old daughter</strong> to an undercover officer posing as a man answering the ad.</p>
<p>Court records show she also arranged for multiple men to have sex with her <strong>7-year-old daughter</strong> in exchange for cash on several occasions, and the Upland woman sent pornographic pictures of her children to several men. Records say, <strong>at times she would watch them have sex and even join in</strong>.</p>
<p>Victims are often young and vulnerable; and traffickers use a number of tactics to establish control, including violence, threats and manipulation.</p>
<p>“If for example you were to look at an ad for a person on January 1, and then you looked for them a week later, and then a week later, and then a week later. You would see them moving across the country. You would see them in Denver one week, in Omaha the next week, in Chicago the next week, and then Philadelphia the next week; and when you look at that, that’s I-80,” said Brewer.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be in an urban area,” said Brewer. “At the end of the day, the trafficker’s motivation is money. Money, money, money, money, money. <strong>There such little risk involved and such great reward in trafficking human beings</strong>.”</p>

            This is the dead giveaway. Call him Moloch, Baal Hammon, Lucifer… The fallen angel of sacrifice always reveals a predilection for the helpless, for the innocent, and above all, for children. Wicked and vicious as they might be, humans are not smart enough to pull off such a sustained evil enterprise over multiple generations. It seems obvious to me that a greater, malevolent intelligence must be at work. And if the devil is real, therefore so is God. Since their attack is primarily directed towards all that's pure, beautiful, virtuous, chaste and innocent, that's what we have to become in order to win. One thing is clear. After everything we know, there is no going back. You can't pretend to ignore evil without becoming evil. These demons are waging a war on Creation and on humanity. They are the opposite of everything we stand for. This won't be a draw, there won't be an armistice or prisoners taken. One side shall be annihilated. It's either them or us.

            The FBI's role in all of this is quite the enigma.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do they have evidence but need more? Do they have more than enough but are sitting on it? Does Trump need to sway public opinion first? Is Trump in on it and this is all a fucking depraved show..... Seriously what the FUCK!

            I think there's a difference between prostituting women/girls/children for profit,, and the sustained, prolonged, ongoing torture of children with the express intent of splitting their personalities in satanic rituals.   Don't get me wrong; I think they are both disgusting.   The abused children of today are tomorrow prostituted women.  Child sex abuse is a great training ground for prostitution.   But pizzagate is about the ritual abuse and torture of children.

             I think the response to this information is Homeland Security's new Blue Program, and local stings across the country. It's been theorized that to go after this as a case of a satanic cult connected to Hillary, the public just wouldn't support it, it's too unbelievable. So it's possible these efforts to stop sex slavery and trafficking is truly the government's answer to pizzagate - maybe they have to fly under the radar a bit so the whole thing doesn't come crashing down at once?

            Another level of disturbing:
Where do transvestites come from? And why are there so many?
Could they be boys trafficked into prostitution and forced into femininity? The more you consider it, the more it seems like the most logical conclusion. But it also leads to the consideration that there are such evil people out there to rape boys, dress them as women, sell them to other evil fucks, even force them into body modification. What a heartbreak it is to consider those boys being abducteded, the dreams they had of being firefighters or doctors completely torn from them, and instead they get fucked as a woman does, for money that isn't even their own. Sad.

            Go to any well traveled truck stop along any major highway, sit by the bathrooms and watch. You will see young girls with a handler come and go. I witnessed this about 4 years ago on I-95.  I went in to use the facilities and there was a girl who couldn't have been more than 14 dressed in really high heels and a very short tight skirt that was standing by the men's bathroom entrance. She was there when I used the bathroom and still there when I was done, and this really haggard woman was standing next to her. Her back was against the wall and they appeared to be lounging there.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember being so struck by how odd it seemed to me (she was all glitzy in heavy makeup too, I guess to make her look older- she looked like my little sister did when she played in mom's makeup) that I sat in the coffee area and watched carefully. I sat for 25 minutes and she never left her post. The woman with her started glaring me down (maybe she thought I was undercover or something) and she abruptly yanked the girls arm and then dragged her out to the parking lot. I waited for a minute and then went out to see if I could get a license plate number to call and give the cops, but they vanished.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the time trafficking never really occurred to me, I thought it was just someone pimping a girl out.  I am ashamed that I couldn't do anything and I failed in doing anything about it. I honestly had never encountered anything like that in real life and didn't know what to do. This whole PG thing has made me think about that girl and I wish I had done something, anything.

             Forgive yourself. I have a question though and it probably is a naive one but ok say you are there or I am there and we suspect  someone under 18  is being trafficked- say we watch them go into a restroom or car or somewhere to have sex. Say you or I call 911----- or what if we take video or we have pics to show or pics of license plate ...Is that a good idea? I say absolutely yes. But what if the police are crooked? Is this a valid way for citizens who just happen to be at a truck stop to be involved in ending this evil?

              I don't know. And I have no idea what the cops would have said or how they would have reacted to me calling and saying I thought a girl was being pimped out at that truck stop. I would have called if I had any license number, but at that time I felt like I would have been patted on the head and sent along if I didn't have some way to validate what I saw.
 Now knowing how compromised the cops are, I don't know what the right answer is.

            This is a very poor reflection of where we are as a society when parents are financially motivated to pimp out their own children. Regardless that there is a demand for sex with children by perverse deviants, the issue of financial insecurity is also exacerbating this problem, are all these parents drug addicts? what could they possibly be thinking?

             This country's god is Mammon. We worship at the altar of consumerism.  It's preached to us everyday,  everywhere,  in 30 second - 3 minute bursts.  Mammon will fill that aching hole in our hearts and lives.  It will make us better.  Or so we think. # endingsermonnow

            This is about as disgusting as it gets.  About the training of personnel, I think the public should be trained.  There should be a short training piece on tv hitting all the hot points in short order time and also flyers handed out outside of churches and bingo halls, etc.  Well, I don't know if that will happen, for the MSM heads and the priests will frown upon that.

             another way to look at this, is that it's been going on for forever, yet it is now coming out, into the light. it's hard to see, but we're lancing the boil.

              That is what  the Neocon, CIA, Deep state, (basically the subhuman feces of the earth) want... they want us to give up and accept. WE can all type on keyboards and discuss and pray and hope and do the FUCKING FBI's job but just know this.
             </p>
             <p>
              I grew up in the South and for the peeps who have not experienced the South and many parts of rural America, we keep to ourselves, we play along, act dumb and talk funny but one thing I can promise everyone here is that there are 300 Million guns (yes that is an M- for million) and the statistics show about 20-25% (are gun owners that "they" can verify). I can promise you there are many more and remember we (gun owners are more than happy to share our guns when the time comes).
             </p>
             <p>
              If justice is NOT served "this time round". I can promise you all that this (CIA, shadow government AKA lingering fecal matter) has never seen what will come out of the wood works. There are a SHIT TON of pissed off people at home cleaning their guns, stock piling ammo and IF and only IF (who the fuck ever is in charge) does not make shit right you will witness the POWER of THE people not seen since the civil war. The folks I am talking about you won't ever hear about until its too late. There are many "sleeper cells" in the south and other parts of the country that will not tolerate this shit any longer. It will not be dusted under the carpet. I bet my life on it and I grew  up with these types of people. WE are at a new stage in all of this research and have made our case.
             </p>
             <p>
              DO you think the police and army are going to side with the fecal matter? Do you realize how many former military Vets there are?  Do you honestly think "they" can put us all in FEMA camps???  LMFAO.  THE FECAL matter CAN'T stop US.  "They" want you to think they can but then can't and "They" know it. This fucked up shit of trafficking, fucking, torturing and EATING (Hillary Clinton) babies IS going to STOP one way or the other.
             </p>
             <p>
              WE have to pick a date ( maybe 4th of July) and we show up in D.C. and give THEM a visual of how many of us there are and put "them" on notice.  I personally am DONE waiting and DOING the worthless FBI'a job when WE (all of YOU Patriots) have provide so much evidence we can't even keep up with it. NO MORE EXCUSES TRUMP, CHAFFETZ  FUCKIN DO SOMETHING NOW.  NO EXCUSES.  and whomever is reading this and doesn't like it COME AND GET MEEEEE... I am NOT AFRAID to die.. We are talking about the lives of innocent children and I am MAD as FUCK.

              I don't know.  I think we are at a tipping point and it could still easily slide right back into the direction it was headed before... the abyss.  Trump is not an accident.  Sometimes God (or fate perhaps if you don't believe in God) chooses a questionable character to do His (it's) work.  Trump is the right man to root out these pedos, even though he is quite flawed in other ways according to some.  There is a balance between good and evil right now that is being fought over to tip either way.  We are at a juxtaposition perhaps as important as where we were in WWII... what will happen next will lead us down one path... or the other... for a long long long time...
