<p>⦁	After the death of CEPIC in 1981, PIO was reorganized into the possibly even more influential European Institute of Management (EIM). Col.

<p>⦁	The second EIM Group indicates on their (now removed) website an interest in human re-engineering, productivity enhancement, more nursing time for nursing staff, behavioural change, and perceptions for which they claim to have a registered trade mark (which I have yet to find evidence for). The head of studio architects (which designs academy schools) confirms architects are involved in human re-engineering; the existence of a therapy room in school plans (certainly at ARK Academy at Wembley) complete with bed indicates some kind of nursing will be occurring. Behavioural change is the agenda for the ARK Inclusion centres. So ARK\'s association with EIM Group (European Institute of Management) is further indicated on account of ARK\'s agenda and what is now being put in place in UK schools.

*ARK funds \'Teens &amp; Toddlers Sustainability Replication Programme\', a eugenics program associated with \'Project Caressing\', teaching children to be tactile with elderly men.  
</p>
<pre><code>...(Laura) Huxley stated that this project promotes bonding between young and old   and is accomplished through caressing.  She said she would like to see more men become involved in the nurturing process.  “It’s very good for men to do this because they also need the feeling of being caressed,” she said. “Kids need to see men as     much as women. It’s never too late to start.” It makes them feel happy and there’s  nothing more beneficial than a little tiny hand coming over, touching and reaching out,” she said.
    (note: Laura Huxley is the wife of author Aldous Huxley, whom authored the book &quot;Brave New World&quot;.  For those who haven\'t read the book, here is the plot summary, which is relative to all the info in this post:   [http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/bravenew/summary.html)](http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/bravenew/summary.html))

<p>&quot;Brave New World&quot; plot overview:    <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/bravenew/summary.html">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/bravenew/summary.html)</a>)  
</p>
<p>(also see: &quot;Themes,Motifs, and Symbols&quot;- the use of technology to control society, the consumer society, the incompatability of happiness and truth, the dangers of an all-powerful state.  Also- The act of sex is controlled by a system of social rewards for promiscuity and lack of commitment.)</p>
<p>&quot;Tavistock&quot; </p>
<p>⦁	potentially &quot;coincidental&quot;  - upon further digging I realized that Tavistock actually publishes info by the director of &quot;Teens &amp; Toddlers&quot; (Diana Whitmore) on Psychosynthesis (I will also try to find the link for this info, it may be in one of these YouTube videos)</p>
<pre><code>Psychosynthesis:  an approach to psychology that was developed by Italian psychiatrist, Roberto Assagioli. Assagioli asserted that &quot;the direct experience of the self, of pure self-awareness... – is true.&quot; Spiritual goals of &quot;self-realization&quot; and the &quot;interindividual psychosynthesis&quot; – of \'social integration...the harmonious integration of the individual into ever larger groups up to the &quot;one humanity&quot;\' – were central to Assagioli\'s theory. Psychosynthesis was not intended to be a school of thought or an exclusive method but many conferences and publications had it as a central theme and centres were formed in Italy and the United States in the 1960s...
</code></pre>

<p>...blahblahblahblahblah...</p>
<pre><code>...Assagioli was not the first to use the term &quot;psychosynthesis&quot;. The earliest was by James Jackson Putnam, who used it as the name of his electroconvulsive therapy. 
</code></pre>

<p>The term was also used by C.G. Jung and A.R. Orage, who were both far closer to Assagioli\'s thinking than Putnam. C. G. Jung had written, comparing his goals to those of Sigmund Freud, &quot;If there is a \'psychoanalysis\' there must also be a \'psychosynthesis which creates future events according to the same laws\'.&quot; A.R. Orage, who was publisher of the influential The New Age journal, also made use of the term, which he hyphenated as psycho-synthesis. Orage formed an early psychology study group (which included Maurice Nicoll who later studied with Carl Jung) and concluded that what humanity needed was not psychoanalysis, but psycho-synthesis. The term was also employed by Bezzoli. Freud, however, was opposed to what he saw as the directive element in Jung\'s approach to psychosynthesis,[8] and argued for a spontaneous synthesis on the patient\'s part: &quot;As we analyse...the great unity which we call his ego fits into itself all the instinctual impulses which before had been split off and held apart from it.&quot;

<p>Arpad Busson, chairman of charity ARK, wants to raise money for the ‘orphans’: <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&amp;sid=a4xra0CjmAAw&amp;refer=uk">http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&amp;sid=a4xra0CjmAAw&amp;refer=uk</a> 	Busson said his biggest hope is for multiple attendees to pledge 100,000 pounds to 	help orphans in Romania and Bulgaria... </p>
<pre><code>One of Ark’s trustees,  Bernard Sabrier has his own charity Children Action and a   partner of that is Bernard Kouchner.  Kouchner himself is subject to allegations that   he was involved in or at least knew of the KLA Organ Harvesting Atrocity.  He was also involved in the lessening of penalties against a convicted pedophile.

	Michel Nihoul was the person who allegedly organized orgies in a Belgian chateau. These Orgies allegedly were attended by a former European commissioner, judges, senior politicians, lawyers and policemen. Nihoul was one of the accomplices of Marc Dutroux.</p>
<pre><code>        Nihoul was also involved in the earlier ‘L’Affaire Pinon’ a series of pedophile orgies managed by the wife of Dr. Pinon. The Nihoul expose raised fears among some of the Belgian elites, that the pedophile indictments would force the reopening of an earlier case, involving the 7th January 1986 murder of a Juan Mendez of Fabrique Nationale.

          <p>
           The term was also used by C.G. Jung and A.R. Orage, who were both far closer to Assagioli's thinking than Putnam. C. G. Jung had written, comparing his goals to those of Sigmund Freud, "If there is a 'psychoanalysis' there must also be a 'psychosynthesis which creates future events according to the same laws'." A.R. Orage, who was publisher of the influential The New Age journal, also made use of the term, which he hyphenated as psycho-synthesis. Orage formed an early psychology study group (which included Maurice Nicoll who later studied with Carl Jung) and concluded that what humanity needed was not psychoanalysis, but psycho-synthesis. The term was also employed by Bezzoli. Freud, however, was opposed to what he saw as the directive element in Jung's approach to psychosynthesis,[8] and argued for a spontaneous synthesis on the patient's part: "As we analyse...the great unity which we call his ego fits into itself all the instinctual impulses which before had been split off and held apart from it."

          <pre><code>        Nihoul was also involved in the earlier ‘L’Affaire Pinon’ a series of pedophile orgies managed by the wife of Dr. Pinon.

            The "Case Officer" for Britain's Opium War was Aldous Huxley. He spearheaded Tavistock's plan for pharmaceutical control with LSD's mindbending results which led to the counterculture, the dialectical response to culture on the way to a totally controlled society. Those who thought they were creating a new society were unwittingly "sleeping with the enemy" by essentially brainwashing themselves and paying for the priviledge with their hearts and minds.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thus, Tavistock channeled and directed youth dissent and rebellion, and disabled the anti-war movement. Youth culture became distracted and disengaged from practical reality and political activism. The revolution was definitely not televised but it was psychoelectric shock treatment. The movement was induced from the top down via CIA-Tavistock agendas and agents of influence. Socially-engineered 'hippies' dropped out of the sociopolitical loop. Psychotropic warfare came to the homefront in the world's biggest social experiment.

            In 1936 Aldous Huxley wrote "Propaganda and Pharmacology" - a more detailed prediction of mind-control drug technology than the "soma" found in his 1932 novel "Brave New World". Huxley predicted: The propagandists of the future will probably be chemists and physiologists as well as writers." Moksha - Writings on Psychedelics and the Visionary Experience 1931-1963" Aldous Huxley, Penguin, 1983, p.38

            Yo I found more shit about EIM. This ties into Roy Cohn who was working with Craig J Spence who was running a gay call boy ring that they used to blackmail politicians with. Roy Cohn was Donald Trumps mentor so this is more damning evidence that points to Trump being controlled opposition. I should also note that Roy Cohn worked with Roger Stone, who was instrumental in selling the Trump presidancy to the infowars audience. (EIM connection is at the bottom paragraph but it's all an important read)
           </p>
           <blockquote>

             We are far from done, however. We also know that in the late 1960s an officer was working at the Geoffrey's Bank with the name "A. Newman", who has been described as a friend and business partner of - you'll never guess - Roy Cohn. [32] And there we go again: round and round. Cohn's been talked about in several previous articles of ISGP, all in relation to underground fascist groups and pedophile entrapment operations. As has already been written down in Beyond Dutroux, Senator John DeCamp once wrote:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Said to be Harold Anderson's "closest friend in Washington," Gray [in the White House under Eisenhower; CEO Hill &amp; Knowlton; advisory council WWF; chair George Town Club, where pedophile entrapment allegedly took place; Mason; supporter of AmeriCares at the time of its pedophile scandals] is also reportedly a specialist in homosexual blackmail operations for the CIA... Gray's associate Wilson was apparently continuing the work of a reported collaborator of Gray from the 1950's—McCarthy committee counsel Roy Cohn, now dead of AIDS. According to the former head of the vice squad for one of America’s biggest cities, 'Cohn's job was to run the little boys. Say you had an admiral, a general, a congressman, who did not want to go along with the program. Cohn’s job was to set them up, then they would go along. Cohn told me that himself.'"
            </p>
            <p>
             Cohn was a good friend of Craig Spence and together with top CIA and Army men, as well as politicians and businessmen, he once threw his birthday party at Spence's house. Spence was later investigated for running a CIA-sanctioned homosexual and pedophile entrapment ring at his house with operations going straight up to the White House. Within several months Spence committed suicide while the records of the investigation were sealed. [33]
            </p>
            <p>
             Only recently did ISGP run into another accusation that yet again seems to indicate that Cohn "ran the the little boys" with the purpose of blackmailing high officials.
            </p>
            <p>
             "[Author Anthony] Summers says he got his info from Susan Rosenstiel, fourth wife of Lewis Rosenstiel, chairman of Schenley Industries, a liquor distiller with reputed mob connections. Ms. Rosenstiel claimed that in 1958 she and her husband went to a party at a New York hotel, where they met Hoover and McCarthy witch-hunt lawyer Roy Cohn. Hoover, whom Cohn introduced as "Mary," was supposedly wearing a wig, a black dress, lace stockings, and high heels. Hoover went into a bedroom, took off his skirt to reveal a garter belt, and had a couple of blond boys--one wearing rubber gloves--"work on him with their hands." Cohn and Hoover then watched while Lewis Rosenstiel had sex with the boys. A year later Ms. Rosenstiel attended another party at the same hotel; this time Hoover wore a red dress and a black feather boa. He had one of the blond boys, who were now dressed in leather, read to him from a Bible while the other "played" with him. Hoover then grabbed the Bible, tossed it down, and told the first boy to join in." [34]
            </p>
            <p>
             Whatever the truth, Hoover was part of the same hard-right, anti-"communosocialist", and JFK-hating group that Cohn and many intelligence men were part of. There also are more than a few accusations of Hoover's homosexual inclinations, mainly related to his associate director at the FBI, Clyde Tolson. The pedophile accusations do seem to be new, but they are not really out of place. But to solidify Cohn's "Nebula" connections, here is another quote from the Beyond Dutroux article:
            </p>
            <p>
             "According to a 1954 news report, Cohn and his aide David Schine had met up with Spanish members of an international underground Nazi network while on a spy-hunting trip in Europe. Some of the leading members of this network, according to the newspaper, were Col. Otto Skorzeny, Hjalmar Schacht and Werner Naumann."
            </p>
            <p>
             Also frequently mentioned on this site: Cohn was a board member of the notorious Permindex firm (there it is again). This company brought together an international group of shady intelligence-connected men whose (overt) idea it was to fight communism on the economic front with the slogan "world trade for world peace". [35] Board members had connections to the CIA, FBI, and Mossad, not to mention the mafia.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Schlumbergers, through Jean de Menil, provided a link to the covert anti-Castro war with Clay Shaw and Guy Banister (the latter only associated with Permindex board members) providing Jim Garrison with a link to the John F. Kennedy assassination. In a previous article ISGP compared Permindex to the notorious European Institute of Management (EIM), which appears to have been at the center of this fascist underground with its apparently very sadistic pedophile entrapment rings. Ambassador Douglas MacArthur II, of the same political wood of Roy Cohn, just happened to be chairman of EIM.

             Michel Nihoul was the person who allegedly organized orgies in a Belgian chateau. These Orgies allegedly were attended by a former European commissioner, judges, senior politicians, lawyers and policemen. Nihoul was one of the accomplices of Marc Dutroux.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            If I understand it correctly NIHOUL is the connection to Dutroux. But where is the connection to Nihoul? This name appears out of nothing in this article!

             the mind control/project monarch connection is the key to the bigger network and the CIA and Hollywood involvement. Only problem is, there is only a little chance to take the lower Washington ring down, and there is zero chance to take the US/worldwide network down, but we should expose them anyway.

            Links back into Pizzagate: Not sure if anyone has ever pointed this out but Kim Noble, the woman with DID who's disturbing "art" is enjoyed by Podesta was a victim of childhood sexual abuse from the time she was quite young:
           </p>
           <p>
            " Kim was born in 1960. Her parents, stuck in an unhappy marriage, were factory workers, and the care of their daughter was farmed out to friends and local acquaintances. The details of what happened are hazy, but it seems that from an early age – somewhere between one and three – Kim suffered extreme and repeated abuse. And at this point her mind, traumatised beyond endurance, shattered into fragments, forming myriad separate identities. The breaks were clean: most of the principal personalities had no memories of abuse and no flashbacks. Thus she was protected from what had happened."
            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/sep/30/kim-noble-woman-with-100-personalities">
             https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/sep/30/kim-noble-woman-with-100-personalities
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Of note, at 14 Kim was sent to the TAVISTOCK INSTITUTE for treatment and remained there for years. The above article also details her trying to tell authorities about a pedo ring but claims she was threatened, had acid thrown in her face and her bed set alight with her in it. She escaped but the house burned to the ground.
           </p>
           <p>
            FBI anon said Tavistock runs everything and Soros owns Tavistock. He said this entire CF investigation would bring down the entire govt if exposed. Doesn't sound like hyperbole any more with the amount of info we have linked.

             This is all good information on Kim Noble/Tavistock, but I don't think there's been a connection made between the Podesta bros' creepy art and Kim Noble. I believe the closest we got was noticing similarities between her art and some of the creepy Comet Ping Pong event posters.

              Kim Noble had an art show at Comet Ping Pong. Let me see if I can find the poster. I remember seeing it all the way back in the beginning when we were still on 4chan &amp; eddit.
             </p>
             <p>
              ETA: It had her artwork, her name and I think the date of the show. But I can't find it in any of the archives. :(

            Holy shit. I didn't even comb through any of this yet but as soon as I clicked on the Arpad Busson Wikipedia link it I saw Timothy Learys name and shit a brick. Leary= MKultra CIA asset, I vaguely saw the rest of what you posted but I noticed Huxleys name towards the end... Huxley along with Gregory Bateson started MKULTRA. Anyways, here is what is says about Leary on Arpads Bussons page on wikipedia
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Arpad Busson's father, Pascal Busson, was a former French army officer and Algerian War veteran, who later turned financier.[2] His mother, Florence "Flockie" Harcourt-Smith, was an English former debutante.[3] His aunt, Joanna Harcourt-Smith, was a companion of Timothy Leary, who coincidentally was married in the early 1960s to the mother of Arpad's partner, Uma Thurman

             I just recently got into the MK Ultra rabbit hole and I really wish that things were pointing at it not being true (even though I havent seen anything to indicate otherwise). This is so wild! Good job connecting those people.

              Thanx man. Check this out too, this explains Tony Podestas Dahmer artwork; excerpt from David Mcgowans Programmed to Kill-
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Three years later, while on a senior class trip to Washington, D.C., Jeffrey
Dahmer made a call from a payphone and then announced to his high school
classmates that he had secured them an appointment to visit the office of the vicepresident
of the United States. Though his friends naturally were skeptical, Jeffrey
did indeed lead them on a tour of Walter Mondale’s office, followed by a visit to
the office of prominent writer Art Buchwald. It has never been explained how the
aspiring serial killer had established such impressive contacts in Washington. And
it has never been revealed who it was that Dahmer called that day to arrange the
impromptu private tours.

              I can't go down this rabbit hole without liquid courage anymore and yea, I know what you mean, it really is all connected. It's interesting to note that Dr. John Coleman said this:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The Rough Guide to Conspiracy Theories notes that the Tavistock Institute has been named by some theorists in their worldviews, including having a part in "The most extravagant anti-Illuminati conspiracy theory" of John Coleman "known as [the] 'Aquarian Conspiracy'. This totalitarian agenda culminates in the Illuminati 'taking control of education in America with the intent and purpose of utterly and completely destroying it.'" By "'means of rock music and drugs to rebel against the status quo, thus undermining and eventually destroying the family unit'."[13] The Huffington Post also mentioned this idea "from popular conspiracy theorist Dr John Coleman", saying that "The Tavistock Institute is a publicly known British charity founded in 1947, but conspiracy theorists believe the Institute's real purpose is to similarly engineer the world's culture." The Post looks at Coleman's claim that the popularity of The Beatles was an Illuminati plot to advance the "Aquarian Conspiracy".[14]

              So we have Social Engineering on a global scale through Tavistock in the UK and then your man Busson is connected to Timothy Leary another counterculture guru who was confirmed to be involved in MKUltra experiments/CIA ... HMMMMMMM. You know who else is connected to Timothy Leary? Winona fucking Ryder (he was her godfather) who was the mom in Stranger Things, a TV show literally about MKULTRA. Now, Leary says that one of his idols was Crowley, who was an Mi6 agent and literally said:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               “For the highest spiritual working, one must accordingly choose
that victim which contains the greatest and purest force. A male
child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory
and suitable victim.”

                You too fam. This is why the dialogue here is key, we can all build off each others knowledge and add to it. If you wan't to learn more about the origins of MKultra (the true mkultra history and not the limited hangout msm version) then I suggest you check out Jan Irvin's Gnostic media. Here is an excerpt from his work on Huxley/Tavistock/Leary:
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Via the Esalen Institute this multi-generational plan to “evolutionize” ( - their idea of evolution was just for them and the elites, not the rest of society whom they planned to dumb down and exterminate via their ideas laid forth in their many published books and programs on eugenics and humanism.) much of humanity was pushed forth via Aldous - with the help of Michael Murphy and Dick Price, with other connections to the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) and the Tavistock Institute and many intelligence agencies, and other, similar sorts of mind control connections, such as with B.F. Skinner - creator of operant conditioning and "the Skinner box" (Esalen even brags of his time there! -

Murray at Harvard of MKULTRA fame. Dr. Tim Leary worked under Murray, and the infamous Dr. Ted Kaczynski, "the Unabomber", was a part of Prof. Murray's experiments. Dr. Kaczynski had attempted to shut those at SRI working on ARPANET and these other mind control / spying systems, down ( see The Net -

            Tavistock is a private investment group owned by George Soros. It was found on reddit. Look for the links to Clinton foundation.

 It's seems geared to various modalities used to control behaviors. Mind control seems a simple term for what they do.

            Tavistock is owned by George Soros.  I was following the FBI ANON and he said follow the money. Tavistock is a hugh key. Good job.

            Good work, let's see how long it take's to get deleted. Can you fix the lifeonchildreninthemix link? If we can substantiate the EIM#2 connection to Dutroux case then we've got a pretty solid connection here.

            I posted this a few layers into a comment thread, but I want to repost it so it's visible. I think it's useful for discussion.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Let me see if I can summarize the essential bits, and you tell me what I missed.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Major Clinton donor is Arpad Busson
            </li>
            <li>
             Arpad Busson is chairman of European Investment Managers (EIM#1) Group
            </li>
            <li>
             European Inestment Managers (EIM#1) is allegedly connected to European Institute of Management (EIM#2) group via a link on the former's website titled "Home" that directs to a google search of the latter. (This is the crux of the argument)
            </li>
            <li>
             European Institute of Management (EIM#2) Group is connected to the Dutroux case based on evidence in the link you provided. (The link is broken, can you fix it?)
            </li>
            <li>
             EIM#2 is circumstantially connected back to Absolute Return for Kids (ARK) because they have the same agenda (weird as fuck agenda btw, but I'm just trying to stick to the logical flow)
            </li>
            <li>
             ARK funds Teens and Toddlers, which is directed by Diana Whitmore
            </li>
            <li>
             Tavistock publishes info by Diana Whitmore, connecting Soros (wait, did I get this wrong? is it Rockafellar?) to ARK (a link for this one would be useful, you said you're working on it)
            </li>
            <li>
             TL;DR It's all a big fucking web of pedos pretending to help children.

             the TL;DR is so fucking true. They'll have to do some legitimate stuff to continue to maintain legitimacy, but, you know it's a meat-market for them. Free and easy access to their prey. It's the worst of the fox guarding the hen-house.

             Obviously this post leaves out all the creepy human re-engineering and psychosynthesis stuff (which is worthy of discussion in it's own right) but I want to make sure that the actual connections are clear for people to see.

             Mod here, this definitely looks interesting. I'm not going to flair it yet until more users vet it or another mod decides it should be. It seems that the whole case here hinges on the validity of that video, which I'm not sure how to confirm. The connections are certainly high level though, and if they can be substantiated further they certainly qualify as a breakthrough. For now, have an upvote and I'll keep an eye on it.
            </p>

             Edit: As far as I am aware there is no requirement to message a mod.

                Tavistock is filed in the Bahamas to avoid US oversight. Tavistock is engaged in numerous illegal activities.  It's been a while, but I can search my files for links.

                The source starts during WWII in England.  It was a place for experimenting on children such as mind control through various torture techniques. I'll get links for you later.  Like I said it's been a while.

               Tavistock is funded by the citizens of the US - taxpayers! Soros is in control of it and all hundreds splinter think tanks, institutes, societies etc. It's a crazy world. Thank God for the internet.

               George Soros does not own the Tavistock Institute. George Soros Jew friend Joe Lewis owns "The Tavistock Group" something completely different, but still a nefarious organization. The Tavistock group was connected to the Orlando shooting fagbar falseflag

               for everyone interested on linux and on mac, youtube-dl is a good command line proggy for downloading videos. If you're whonix or tails, you can still install and use youtube-dl there.

               I understand the feeling man, I've been there. Let me see if I can summarize the essential bits, and you tell me what I missed.
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                Major Clinton donor is Arpad Busson
               </li>
               <li>
                Arpad Busson is chairman of European Investment Managers (EIM#1) Group
               </li>
               <li>
                European Inestment Managers (EIM#1) is allegedly connected to European Institute of Management (EIM#2) group via a link on the former's website titled "Home" that directs to a google search of the latter. (This is the crux of the argument)
               </li>
               <li>
                European Institute of Management (EIM#2) Group is connected to the Dutroux case based on evidence in the link you provided. (The link is broken, can you fix it?)
               </li>
               <li>
                EIM#2 is circumstantially connected back to Absolute Return for Kids (ARK) because they have the same agenda (weird as fuck agenda btw, but I'm just trying to stick to the logical flow)
               </li>
               <li>
                ARK funds Teens and Toddlers, which is directed by Diana Whitmore
               </li>
               <li>
                Tavistock publishes info by Diana Whitmore, connecting Soros (wait, did I get this wrong? is it Rockafellar?) to ARK (a link for this one would be useful, you said you're working on it)
               </li>
               <li>
                TL;DR It's all a big fucking web of pedos pretending to help children.

                 The video can be downloaded as a WMV file from the wikileaks page, but obviously do so at your own risk. If someone could provide a mirror that would be awesome, but I'm pretty sure it's illegal due to the gag orders and whatnot.

            First, please ignore my name.....this was created before I knew about the org.  I just wanted to inform you  that
Wikileaks has a new area for investigation and research....  I am sure you understand that the information you are finding is important to be secure etc.  They also might have ways to coordinate
everything and help with presenting it to people, attorneys etc. that can strategize to bring all these devils down.
Check out wikileaks on reddit for more info or go directly to Wikileaks.....MAY GOD BLESS ALL OF US!!!

             Done an awesome job. The network of those involved is ever-expanding and the more names we can add to the list of Clinton Foundation donors, the more people that may end up accountable when this comes crashing down on the Podestas &amp; Clintons heads.
