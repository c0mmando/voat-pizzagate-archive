            The Olympics bankrupts countries and we know during these events large amounts of human trafficking. Fuck the Olympics. Most of these stadiums rot after the events anyway.

             that the Olympics suck.  I watched them (and loved them) once, back in 1972.  Loved seeing Mark Spitz kick ass and bring pride to the USA.  But ever since then, I guess my spirit woke up more.  The Olympics have always seemed like a real creepfest to me.  Now, thanks to you,

               , Oh gosh, Carm, I really wish I knew how to post pictures here, because if I could I would take a screen shot.  Hmm. Maybe I can DM it to ya.  I'll see.  How I saw the demon was it was just there, on the screen, as plain in the picture as the writing is on this monitor right now.  I'll see what I can do about taking a screen cap for ya, gal.  Hang on.  It may not be until the morning because family obligations and all.  But it was a frightening vision and I saw it so I want you to see what I saw. Why? BECAUSE YOU ROCK.
              </p>
              <p>
               Don't worry a bit about the Olympics.  I know you're not "un-American."  Hell, HATE AWAY.  I don't think the least bit about your dislike of the Olympics.  I think it's just that we're adults, and we see these big-ass events for what they are:  fairgrounds for reprobates, and things to which fresh meat get attracted or, even worse, through which the victims get intentionally trafficked.  When I was young I had a friend whose father was a huge party-pooper.  He never wanted his kids to go play in the woods with the rest of us.  He wouldn't let his kids take long bike rides and do all the fun things that the rest of the kids were doing.  He also didn't want his kids to go to the carnivals that rolled through town a couple of times a year.  We all though the guy was just such a dud.  Only after we all grew up and had our own families did we finally understand.
              </p>
              <p>
               It turns out that the party pooper, dud-of-a-dad should have actually been given a FATHER OF THE YEAR AWARD, after all.  Turns out he was an assistant district attorney in his kids' town, so he had the 411 on what was really going on around that place.
              </p>
              <p>
               (a)  NO LONG-DISTANCE BIKE RIDES?  Turns out there had been kidnappings of kids off their bikes, but he never told his kids about it.  Instead he just said, "NO" to the kids and let them hate him for it, because he didn't want to scare the shit out of all the kids in the neighborhood ('though he told the parents what was up).
              </p>
              <p>
               (b)  NO PLAYING DOWN IN THE WOODS?  Turns out there were incidents involving what appeared to be Satanic ritual abuse down there, and he was petrified his kids would stumble across the remains of burnt animals (or worse).
              </p>
              <p>
               (c)  NO GOING TO THE CARNIVAL?  Turns out he knew full well that most of the guys running the rides were ex-convicts, and he didn't want his kids around them because a lot of them were pedos.
              </p>
              <p>
               So I'm sure if that old guy were still around he would be right with you (and me) on our disdain for the Olympics.  Like someone mentioned, the towns get trashed, the Olympic Villages fall into disgusting ruin, and there's nothing but shit left in the wake.
              </p>
              <p>
               So Hell yeah, I hate the Olympics, too.  I hate the things that people exploit to hurt innocent people.  I just wish we all could enjoy what's already here, outside our doors, in nature.
              </p>
              <p>
               TRUE CONFESSION:  My family and I were just spending time re-playing our video cameras from this afternoon.  We live near a large body of water, near woods, and in the evenings we like to play the tapes and see what wild animals were hanging out in the yard while we were gone today.  That's how dopey and simple we are around here.  We just had some great "FOX FOOTAGE," not to be confused with FoxNews, lol, and it was beautiful.  I don't get why others can't just appreciate all the beauty in this world.  Why they have to hurt others and destroy?  But since they are out there -- those same scumbags from whom my friend's dad protected us when we were young -- I'm willing to keep vigilant and researching and do whatever I can to bring 'em down, even if it means just posting little breadcrumbs here and there.
              </p>
              <p>
               Okay, enough babbling into this machine.  I'll catch ya later.  Goodnight all.

                 !  I'm glad you shared and I'm glad my words were somehow meaningful to you in a small way.  We are good people, cuz we just don't approve of Satanic pedophiles destroying humanity, and I have thoroughly enjoyed getting to know you on here.  I'm getting old, so I now have a perspective on the things thst used to annoy me or perplex me.  You are wise beyond your years, I know, and that's why I've always said "YOU ROCK."  Stay strong and get yourself outside a bit so that the darkness of this board won't ever get you down.  You and your family remain in my thoughts and prayers, kid.
