            In this picture, notice there's a man positioned behind her. On first glance, it looks like he's just randomly there, with his back to her, but actually, on closer examination which show the position of his legs, he is carefully posed directly behind the girl and facing the camera.
           </p>
           <p>
            Given that the girl was taped to the table for the sake of the photograph, we can assume the man was also part of the photograph's design. But why? What does the body of a man, his head and face not even included, add to this photo?
           </p>
           <p>
            He seems to be where he is, directly behind the girl, to create a sort of collage - the girl in front overlaps him, and she also seems, from the positioning of both, to be between his legs and under his genitals. This would appear to be a "safe," partially-censored way to visually represent by suggestion a pedophile's sexual desire for the girl.

             I kind of just assumed that he was the one that did the tape job and was stepping back for the photo to be taken.
            </p>
            <p>
             The blur around his shorts would probably indicate that he was moving to his right as the photo was being taken, i think if there was intent on the pose he was taking he would be front on and standing still.

              That's interesting. I never thought of that, but wouldn't he go to one side of her, and then the other, to tape her wrists?
             </p>
             <p>
              And considering that the photo was staged, and what "jimmycomet" is known to be like, you have to think the man being in the picture wasn't by accident, but whoever had the idea, composed the image just the way he wanted it to be, and that included having a man in it.
             </p>
             <p>
              I've come to think that the man in this photo, like the use of pedophile symbols, is there for a purpose that's somewhat under the radar. The photo contains some of the ideas of child pornography, but without its hazards for the child pornographers. So I think that the photographer and man worked together to direct him to stand in just the right spot and way, to suggest ideas that pedophiles viewing the photo would immediately notice and find enjoyable. The pedophiles enjoy seeing the girl, and imagining themselves as the man in the photo, and how the man is positioned gives them ideas. Some probably also enjoy the "hidden message" element of all this, too, such as Besta Pizza's old logo, which most people didn't give a second thought to.

               Its possible mate. At this stage nothing would surprise me.

               My inner voice is telling me you are looking to far into it... however from what i'm gathering that could just be the result of my somewhat pre-conditioned mind... ugh.
I'm so not "that guy"... but every time i open my mouth about all this i cant help but start feeling like him.

                I understand. I'm a woman so I look at all this a little differently. But still, sexual abuse makes everyone uncomfortable. I've been in a place in public that has t.v.'s going, and I could feel the discomfort of people sitting there when a story came on about sexual abuse, and I've felt that discomfort myself. Women do wrong things, too.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm a Christian, though, and I'm comforted by knowing that something that pops into my head is just that, and nothing more. It's a form of temptation but as long as I believe it's wrong, then I'm innocent despite a thought or feeling of guilt popping up.
               </p>
               <p>
                I also was "mildly" sexually abused, and have a little artistic ability and have taken quite a few classes in art and art theory. I also can add that I have a relative that had something of an inappropriate sexual attraction many years back when young (which I don't believe they ever illegally acted upon) and this person also took photos involving it (they weren't in the least illegal but were disturbing). All in all, I believe what I do about this photo because I think the people who dreamed it up were passionate about their subject down to getting into all of the photo's details.
