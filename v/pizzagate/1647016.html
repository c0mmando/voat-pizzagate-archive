<p>What does this mean for Pizzagate?</p>
<p>By pushing international terms that cannot be met, the opposition successfully maintains a wedge between US and Russia, which means the opposition keeps profiting, but also, huge terrorist groups significant to destroying our culture will continue to serve as an upper-level-US LE and investigative distraction of resources that could be otherwise focused on internal crime and protecting US (and all) children. Russia is very pro-family, it would be nice if US culture could get back there too, but with a weakening of focused resources (by above named political-pressure manipulations), our Pizzagate concerns will be successfully watered down into nothing in the eyes of -both- the public -and- of federal-level LE resources.</p>
<p>Huge war profiteers, with all the lobbyists and other powerful influence, will benefit. As a building-block guarantee of this direction, Obama\'s administration was not kidding around with the strategy of sanctions on Russia, which was later then perceived to be used as some sort of future bargaining tool held over the Russians by the Trump administration. How unfortunate. </p>
<p>Given this whole situation, is there another way for the opposition to succeed (as apparently they will at any cost) without having a whole culture (i.e., US) forget about Pizzagate with all the children?</p>',

            Notice how a
            <strong>
             White House spokesperson
            </strong>
            brought up the current demand that is completely against what Trump has said regarding his international strategy:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://sputniknews.com/politics/201702071050412063-trump-wants-get-along-russia">
             https://sputniknews.com/politics/201702071050412063-trump-wants-get-along-russia
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            All while others
            <strong>
             in the same party
            </strong>
            see a different future situation, preferring a situation where the
            <strong>
             Obama-admin-placed sanctions
            </strong>
            are strategic:
           </p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Undoubtedly and certainly, war profiteers heavily continue to profit from effected tensions, while the Pizzagate solution would heavily benefit from relief of this upper-level-US LE resource drain.
           </p>
           <p>
            Herein is at least part of the answer as to why the FBI and other LEs
            <strong>
             with evidence (!) to pursue Pizzagate arrests
            </strong>
            appear to be "taking their time on it." They certainly are
            <em>
             necessarily
            </em>
            "taking their time" with so many political and public pressures moving
            <em>
             them and all their resources
            </em>
            in divided directions!
