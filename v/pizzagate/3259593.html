<p>The legislation, known as House Bill 379, states that criminals convicted for a sexual offense involving anyone under the age of 13 would be &quot;required to undergo chemical castration treatment in addition to any other penalty or condition prescribed by law.&quot; </p>
<p>The law, which was sent to Ivey\'s desk over the weekend, said it would also require the criminal to foot the bill for the procedure, but also states that the bill would &quot;prohibit a person from being denied parole because of indigency.&quot;</p>
<p>This bill would also provide that if a  person is ordered to undergo chemical castration  treatment as a condition of parole and the person  refuses to undergo the treatment, his or her  refusal would constitute a violation of parole and 6 would result in the person being remanded to the custody of the Department of Corrections,&quot; the legislation also reads. </p>
<p>Alabama state Rep. Steve Hurst (R) told local station WIAT that the bill &quot;would deter something like this happening again in Alabama and maybe reduce the numbers&quot; if it becomes law.</p>
<p>&quot;I had people call me in the past when I introduced it and said, \'don\'t you think this is inhumane?\'&quot; Hurst said of the bill. &quot;I asked them what\'s more inhumane than when you take a little infant child, and you sexually molest that infant child when the child cannot defend themselves or get away, and they have to go through all the things they have to go through. If you want to talk about inhumane--that\'s inhumane.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They have marked this child for life and the punishment should fit the crime,&quot; he also said.</p>
<p>If signed by Ivey, the bill would take effect on &quot;first day of the third month following its passage and approval by the governor, or its otherwise becoming law,&quot; the measure states. </p>

            Alabama is coming out with some pretty strong legislation lately. Don't know what lit the fire under them, but they're coming out blazing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have no objection to this, I just haven't seen the effectiveness of it. Since it's in use in several countries, there must be stats. But even if used as a deterrent, I don't see this is anywhere near as inhumane as them preying on innocent children. The children did nothing wrong, they are the ones that did.

            Not enough.  Chemical castration can easily be reversed, so what really is the point?  If they really want to put a stop to child sexual molestation, then it needs to be permanent.  And I'm not sure that surgical castration would really be enough, they can still molest a child.

            SUMMARY
           </p>
           <p>
            Eight states allow chemical or surgical castration of sex offenders. They are: California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Montana, Oregon, Texas, and Wisconsin. California was the first state to allow chemical castration when its governor signed into law a measure allowing certain sex offenders to receive medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) treatment or its equivalent as punishment for their crime. MPA, an artificial female hormone, is commonly sold under the name Depo-Provera and is used to treat abnormal uterine bleeding, promote menstrual cycles, and treat symptoms of menopause. When used by men, MPA has the effect of reducing their testosterone levels to pre-puberty levels.
           </p>
           <p>
            Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Oregon, Montana, and Wisconsin followed California's lead and now allow treatment as punishment for certain sexual offenses. Florida, like California, makes treatment mandatory for repeat offenders. In all of these states treatment is a condition of release from custody and generally starts before the offender is released. In Louisiana, treatment is also a condition of sentence reduction or suspension.
           </p>
           <p>
            Castration laws in California, Georgia, Louisiana, Montana, and Wisconsin only apply to offenders convicted of sex offenses against minors.
           </p>
           <p>
            California, Florida, and Louisiana allow offenders who may or must undergo treatment to opt for surgical castration. Texas is the only state that currently allows certain repeat offenders to elect surgical castration without a treatment option.

             Lowering the testosterone.  But is that permanent or do they have to keep taking it?  They could stop at any moment.  If they could do something permanent it would be a benefit for women and some men too.  Still Children are still vulnerable.  These sickos can come up with all kinds of perverted tricks.

              They have to keep taking it over the course of time. Pedes are " kept track of" so they would have to comply.

               Only their friends will be allowed to skip it. It’s a start and would be good if it went even further in near future. I think when people start catching on to their pedo “movement “ things will start popping really quick. Laws like this will be going much further. And will become much harsher.
