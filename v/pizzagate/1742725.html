            I love this song and yes at first I was turned off by the symbolism of the pizza. But perhaps its a coincidence.

            Pazuzu is a statue that appears at many places around Kong Studios, like in Murdoc's old Winnebago, outside the studios, on t-shirts and in the Rock it video. Pazuzu is a Sumerian-babylonian demon god. He's revered by Murdoc. Murdoc has a scepter with the head of Pazuzu.
           </p>
           <p>
            Murdoc Niccals is the offical bass player of Gorillaz. He was born in Stoke-On-Trent on June 6th 1966.
           </p>
           <p>
            He became a satanist after making deals with the devil and aquired his bass guitar "El Diablo" in the process. His middle name was changed from "Alphonce" to "Faust."
           </p>
           <p>
            Background
           </p>
           <p>
            He was dumped on his father's doorstep in infancy and went on to a very abusive childhood. It has been proposed that his many addictions and his sour attitude were due to his abusive childhood. Sebastian Jacob Niccals, (or Jacob Sebastian Niccals, depending on who's asking) was a spiteful drunk of a man who often verbally abused and exploited his sons.
           </p>
           <p>
            The local pub had a routine talent show that Murdoc was often forced to participate in so he could win his father's drinking money. The performances arranged by his father were always humiliating song and dance numbers, usually with feathered costumes and tap shoes, including one performance in which Murdoc was forcibly dressed up as Pinocchio and sang "I've Got No Strings". It was here that Murdoc decided to become a musician. He would never again take the stage under someone else's direction. He would wreak his havoc on this world of buffoons.

            Wondering if this 'bands' creator new something about international child sex trafficking rings, blackmail and extortion at our top echelon's of government?

            Gorillaz
           </p>
           <p>
            Gorillaz are an English virtual band created in 1998 by Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett. The band consists of four animated members: 2D (lead vocals, keyboard), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar), Noodle (guitar, keyboard, and backing vocals) and Russel Hobbs (drums and percussion). These members are completely fictional and are not personas of any "real life" musicians involved in the project.[4] Their fictional universe is explored through the band's website and music videos, as well as a number of other media, such as short cartoons. The music is a collaboration between various musicians, with Albarn being the only permanent musical contributor. Writers and critics have described their music as alternative rock,[5] Britpop,[6] trip hop,[7] hip hop,[8] electronica, indie, dub, reggae and pop.
           </p>
           <p>
            The idea to create Gorillaz came about when the two were watching MTV. Hewlett said, "If you watch MTV for too long, it's a bit like hell – there's nothing of substance there. So we got this idea for a cartoon band, something that would be a comment on that."

            "with the holograms beside me, I'll dance alone tonight, in a mirrored world are you beside me, all my life.  Res of song seems to be about someone broke, in debt, depressed and then comes into $$$ but pays the price.  Their new album Humanz tracklist has some sketchy titles including ""Sex Murder Party" . If you google the title, it takes you to website with track and title "Dance Weird Baby" , Probably reading way too much into it  .

            So, judging by the level of 'shock' in this thread, I had a thought. For all intents and purposes main stream news is 100% corrupted and main stream movies are 100% corrupted. Why are we in shock (me too) that main stream music is also corrupted?
           </p>
           <p>
            I think we need to shift our thinking.
           </p>
           <p>
            As shitty as it sounds, its starting to look like we should presume all main stream media sources are corrupt until proven otherwise. It makes sense - 80 / 20 rule would dictate that if the MTPs control 20% of the media, it will account for controlling 80% of media consumers. If I was tasked with this, the largest players in any media field would be my highest proirites to get bring into the fold. The rest is chump change.
           </p>
           <p>
            See here for definition of MTP - from now on i refuse to use the term 'elite'

            Something to consider is that some of these artists are aware of it and creating art purposely with the intention of red-pilling people. They put the symbols in as a way to at least get the symbol in your mind. Not necessarily always as a negative way. The choice of venue can even be considered as part of the attempted red-pilling. Not saying that's what Gorillaz is doing, just saying.

             Maybe it's my bias because I'm a fan of the Gorillaz music, but this is what I thought.  Murdoc is a Satanist in the Gorillaz lore, and he is one of the main antagonists in the series.  Russell has had literally been battling demons that haunt him.  2D was injured by Murdoc and made sort of brainless so being the Satanist that he is, Murdoc abuses this and controls 2D.  Noodle was experimented on as a child and was controlled by verbal commands before eventually delivered to Kong studios at the ripe age of 8 years old.  I've always thought the fantastical, dark world of the Gorillaz was fascinating because it talked about control, freedom, and society in a rich and allegorical way.  At the time, I had no idea that the truth was nearly as strange and fucked up as the fictitious band's journey.  I think that Russel's shirt in this video and the creepiness of the pizza are two signs that this video is a red pill and not a celebration of pizzagate.

            Well, there's one benefit in going to the concert... keep your eyes peeled for anything suspicious. If your concerns are warranted and this is legit symbolism, be ready to snap pics/video/periscope if you see any shady business.
           </p>
           <p>
            In terms of the video itself - definitely dark/astral projection shit/demon-like references. But I noticed something else, not only was the pizza animation creepy and out of place, but the larger black character has "Its not Rael"... with the hashtags and phrases circulating around "Pizza Gate is Real" - I decided to dig a bit. While it could be nothing, I found a strange reference to pedophilia in a 2014 /pol/ on Reddit:

               Pause at 2:12 you will see the bannister makes the I and the shelf is crooked letter. Exactly 3:03 ice cream falls on his head and first piece of pizza visible.

            Most music released nowadays has occult symbols embedded in it.

            I'm sure if you go back through their song history now you know of PG you will be exposed to a lot more hidd n themes. I've watched plenty of movies I used to love and seen the shit everywhere when it has no point or need to be there what so ever. It's sad because it's things we used to like but now
It's just creepy and fuckimg weird like every damn thing I watch or look at.

             Exactly - this is what upsets me a lot about the whole thing. I've been on the Voat side of the investigation since day one - I remember the day this stuff broke and people were looking at goat hill pizza. I'm sick of waiting for something to happen. I'm tired of talking to people who look at me like I'm mental. This Gorillaz gig is genuinely making me anxious. An event I should be looking forward to is actually now making me fearful that 'they (whoever they are) are planning for something awful to happen to all attendees. The recent attack on the UK (London Bridge Is Falling Down) is scary enough, but these things are happening more and more. I'm gonna trawl through the video and look at everything in detail. God I feel like I'm turning Schizo. Pizzagate was the worst redpill I ever swallowed
