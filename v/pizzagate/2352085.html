            It's pretty hilarious she cites these as examples of power while reaching out to the mob through her ex-husband who had actual ties to the Mafia.   I'm guessing she didn't admit to collecting names of enforcers back before the custody hearing.
           </p>
           <p>
            And Mickey Featherstone was not even in NY then.  He in the witness protection program after his own gang set him up.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Turning informer
Featherstone was convicted in March 1986 for the April 1985 murder of Michael Holly, despite being innocent of this particular murder, which was a revenge attack probably carried out by another of the Westies, Billy Bokun. He was shocked at receiving his sentence of 25 years in prison, and concluded that he had been framed by his own gang. Rather than serving his sentence he instead told prosecutors that Bokun had committed the murder, and he became an informant.His wife Sissy co-operated with the District Attorney's office to tape incriminating conversations with gang members, including Bokun. In September 1986, Judge Alvin Schlesinger overturned Featherstone's conviction. His testimony at Coonan's racketeering trial during 1987-8 helped to bring down Coonan's gang.He pleaded guilty to a racketeering charge and received a suspended sentence of five years probation from Judge Robert W. Sweet due to his cooperation with the authorities. He was freed in December 1988 and went into a witness protection program.

             I don't find it hilarious, that's why I wrote her name in the title. She is fully admitting her ties there, that seems evident. I'm not going to speculate on why she said what she said but I'm sure her fear didn't lie in just one person, Featherstone but others surrounding him. Connections have nothing to do with loyalty.

              The hilarious part is that she is the one with mafia connections, but she is acting like she is in danger.
             </p>
             <p>
              And since she is one who with one phone call gets names of Mafia protection driven to her, she has to make them up on his side.   Having a Teamster driver is standard on movie sets.  So she hasn't established anything yet.

              It's a giant, giant leap from he has publicists and works with Teamsters to he is going to have me killed.

              Especially when she testified her that her ex husband offered to break Woody's legs.

                 I have a feeling Farrow and Allen are both telling some truth, and both lying. Two connected Hollywood scumbags. Neither seem like good people to me.

                 It's in Maureen Orth's article.  It was not that Woody going to an enforcer to have Satchel's legs broken.  Woody said it after Satchel kicked him.   I don't think this is the equivalent of calling up your ex husband who is tight with the Mafia.
                </p>
                <p>
                 For her part Mia claimed the have Woody's legs broken thing was a joke.

                 I went to school in NJ went this was going and it was apparent that there pro Woody and pro Mia journalists.  This is why you have to look for neutral witnesses when you can.

                <p>
                 In NY the Hamill Brothers Pete and Dennis were well known columnists for the Daily News.   They were pro Woody, I think they had a brother who worked with Woody.
Maureen Orth is the handpicked journalist who Mia went to tell her story and authorized her friends to talk to.  She turned down many other interviewers/reporters.  Team Woody claims she's a friend of Mia.  When you read Orth, you are reading Mia's side of the story.

                 There was a book that came out two years ago that says Sinatra was not joking at all.

                  Did Frank Sinatra ask the Mafia to MURDER Woody Allen? A new book sensationally says he did - as revenge for betraying the singer's ex-wife Mia Farrow 
New book claims Frank Sinatra asked the Mafia to murder Woody Allen
Allegation was made to David Evanier, the author of biography Woody
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But Len Triola, a concert producer, says the singer Frankie Randall, a close friend of Sinatra, confided to him that, ‘livid’ over Allen’s behaviour, Ol’ Blue Eyes went a lot further than making an idle threat.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  ‘Frank wanted him f***ing clipped. Taken out. That’s what he wanted,’ he told Evanier. ‘Frank loved Mia. He spoke to three people every day’ — his wife, his daughter Nancy and Mia.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  According to Randall, Sinatra — whose close links with the Mob are well-documented — tried to call in a favour from his Mafia contacts, only to find he was asking too much.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Sinatra didn’t have ‘the juice’, the power with the men in charge, said Mr Triola. ‘The boys wouldn’t sanction it for him. The guys Frank dealt with, the old-timers, reputable people who aren’t with us any more or [are] in jail, wouldn’t sanction that. It would set a bad precedent.’
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Triola says he heard it ‘from many guys’ that Sinatra ‘really wanted him [Allen] offed’.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But for all his reported sway with the Mob bosses who flocked to see Sinatra perform and partly financed his early career, they wouldn’t be budged.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  ‘They’re not ethical people to begin with, but they’re not just going to kill a movie director because he cheated on a guy’s ex-wife,’ said Mr Triola.

                 No, it means I know who you are. You're always an asshole.

                <p>
                 The fact that you would automatically take Woody Allen's side is all I really need to know about you. I saw it in an article. I'm done now. Buh-bye
