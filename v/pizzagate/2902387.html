            They are too many strange things, the restaurant is ugly as a fish but important people come, they have a Thai room according to the invitations of events, they have a clear symbolism of Satanism and ancient religious ceremonies, and despite the bad propaganda and consequent loss of clients the business survives.

"Acting DC Police Chief Peter Newsham told reporters Sunday evening that Welch walked into Comet Ping Pong and did fire at least one shot into the ground. Police added that the Welch's car is registered in North Carolina.
Welch made no vocal threats or demands during the incident inside Comet Ping Pong, police say."
(Newsham is the one who had his picture taken with Alefantis in support of Comet Ping Pong. Did not investigate pizzagate allegations.)

             WHY SHE LEFT COMET AND BUCK'S "Alefantis says Greenwood "has decided to pursue other challenges and interests including food opportunities in NYC, food writing, music and art." Greenwood was unavailable for comment.
UPDATE: "I am leaving the restaurants to address urgent family matters," Greenwood says. "I have many creative projects in process including an upcoming show at Civilian Art Projects in the fall concurrent with the release of a record I am working on...I'm also travelling to India in the fall to collaborate on a series of stories on regional Indian cuisine and the increasingly important farm-to-table connection there. We are looking at more central locations in DC for a restaurant, art and music space, but nothing has been finalized.""

             NYT  News:
"Mr. Alefantis, an artist born and raised in Washington, co-founded Comet Ping Pong 10 years ago as a casual spot for clay oven pizza. The restaurant has kid-friendly features like Ping-Pong tables and a craft room. Famous natives like members of the band Fugazi have held small shows there. The eatery, which seats 120, is a mash-up of red and white checkered tablecloths and modernist murals and paintings from friends of Mr. Alefantis.
Mr. Alefantis mingles with other Washington chefs and his establishment helped him to be named No. 49 in GQ magazine’s 50 most powerful people in Washington in 2012. His customers include some high-powered locals, such as Tony Podesta, the brother of John Podesta, whom Mr. Alefantis knows casually. Mr. Alefantis and Mr. Brock, who is the founder of Media Matters for America, a website that tracks press coverage critical of the Clintons and works to debunk misinformation in the conservative press, broke up five years ago."

             "Mr. Alefantis and Mr. Brock, who is the founder of Media Matters for America, a website that tracks press coverage critical of the Clintons and works to debunk misinformation in the conservative press, broke up five years ago."
"David Brock, the founder of the liberal media watchdog organization Media Matters, was blackmailed for $850,000 by his gay ex-lover who threatened to reveal information about the nonprofit group's finances to donors and the IRS, according to dueling lawsuits.
In order to pay the handsome sum, Brock sold a historic $1.5 million home he owned in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, the author claims."
"In May 2010, Brock says his lover sent an e-mail to him and his new partner James Alefantis that read: 'David, You and James pulled this same kind of sick nonsense in 2008 to try to hide your financial malfeasance. Next step is I contact all of your donors and the IRS. OK? Do you understand?"
             <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2107394/Media-Matters-founder-David-Brock-accuses-gay-ex-lover-blackmailing-850K.html">

             </a>
             REHOBATH BEACH, DELAWARE CONNECTIONS:
"As posted earlier at rense.com, Fox News reported: “Sussex County (Delaware) property records show (Brock) took out a $273,000 mortgage to buy the pale yellow colonial and carriage house for $606,666 in 1995. As the converted inn, built in 1793, continued to rise in value, Brock refinanced his loan on at least two occasions. Records show he had a $1.44 million mortgage on the property, as well as two more loans against the home totaling just over $500,000. Brock received $1,587,500 for the home on May 25, 2010, in a sale to McLean, Va.-based Vardell Realty Investments.”
"The Fox News report, by Perry Chiaramonte, continued: “The Rehoboth Beach home was torn down months after Brock sold it, amid much community opposition, so the buyer could divide the parcel and build two homes. It remains a vacant lot.” It is beyond suspicious that a 207-year-old historic house, with more than $1 million in resale value, would be ripped down. Realtor Michael Vardell has kept an unusually low profile for a real-estate agent. His addresses varied from Charlestown, South Carolina, to Bethesda, Maryland, and McLean, Virginia, towns that are associated respectively with the U.S. Navy, Walter Reed Army Hospital, and the CIA. ...
The house sale was preceded by a property dispute with ex-partner William Grey. That legal conflict diclosed key dates about Brock’s relocation from Rehoboth Beach to the nation’s capital. In 2005 Brock started to date James Alefantes in Washington DC; in 2007 Brock removed some of his belongings to live with his new partner in D.C. while keeping his domicile with old partner Grey, and then in 2010 Grey filed a legal complaint against Brock, who by then had finished moving out the furniture.
How does Brock’s time-line correlate with the biggest sex-crime case in Delaware’s history? Perhaps not by coincidence, in 2004, the receptionist at a pediatric clinic in Lewes, just 7 miles from Rehoboth Beach, filed a complaint with Sussex County police over pedophilic acts committed by Dr. Earl Bradley against his underage patients from Dover, Delmar, Easton and Rehoboth Beach. There were other citations, including from a local police officer, as discussed in the Wilmington WBOC news article “Red flags consistently missed for accused pedophile doctor.”"

             "Gareth Wade, 47, and Doug Clarke, 50, were sitting down for pizza and beer at Comet when they spotted a commotion. All of a sudden, said Wade, “the server said someone just walked in with a shotgun.

            <p>
             “A man had just walked into the building, passed us into the back of the building, he seemed to have a shotgun or a rifle-type of [gun] and said we ought to vacate the building,” Wade recalled the server saying."

             "Police said 28-year-old Edgar Maddison Welch, of Salisbury, N.C., walked in the front door of Comet Ping Pong and pointed a firearm in the direction of a restaurant employee. The employee was able to flee and notify police. Police said Welch proceeded to discharge the rifle inside the restaurant; they think that all other occupants had fled when Welch began shooting."

             Benjamin Freed and Jessica Sidman of the Washingtonian wrote: "Acting DC Police Chief Peter Newsham told reporters Sunday evening that Welch walked into Comet Ping Pong and did fire at least one shot into the ground. Police added that the Welch's car is registered in North Carolina. Welch made no vocal threats or demands during the incident inside Comet Ping Pong, police say." (Newsham is the one who had his picture taken with Alefantis in support of Comet Ping Pong. Did not investigate pizzagate allegations.)

            <p>
             SO, WHEN DID HE FIRE INTO A LOCKED CLOSET SUPPOSEDLY CONTAINING A COMPUTER HARD DRIVE?
If Welch was truly investigating for "trafficked children", why would he fire into a closet that could have potentially been hiding children?
If Welch believed there was a basement in Comet hiding trafficked children, WHY WOULD HE FIRE A GUN INTO THE FLOOR?
False flag?

             WAS THIS PART OF A PLEA DEAL?
Before driving to Comet:
"Edgar Maddison Welch struck a teenager with his car, sending him to the hospital by helicopter, in October 2016, according to a report by WBTV.

            </p>
            <p>
             The incident happened about 7:30 p.m. in Salisbury, North Carolina, the news station reports. Kenyatta Belton, 13, suffered head, torso and leg injuries after he was truck by Welch’s Buick LeSabre. (HE DRIVES TO COMET IN A PRIUS)
            </p>
            <p>
             Witnesses told the news station that the victim was walking with several other friends when he was struck by the car.
            </p>
            <p>
             “We was walking down the road, just a normal walk, and this one car had the full road,” Belton’s friend, Sean Lankford, told the news station. “We was pretty much on the white line and he wiped out one of my friends and he had the whole road to turn into even the whole other lane, even in the same lane he could have avoided him.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “My friend is really really badly hurt, it’s just a normal walk gone bad and one car made a big difference,” Lankford told WBTV."

"Welch has had a brief career in the film industry, according to an IMDB profile. He was a production assistant on two independent films, “The Mill” and “A Tale About Bootlegging” and was an actor in another film, “The Bleeding” in 2009.

             Note: ONE witness. Welch pointed gun in his direction (assault with a dangerous weapon). Witness fled out back and called 911. Does not mention anyone hearing gun shots. States "unlawful discharge of a firearm."  DOESN'T SAY WHERE OR HOW MANY OR WHEN. DOES NOT MENTION EYE WITNESS TO THIS.  The door, lock and COMPUTER TOWER is only listed as DAMAGED and is taken into custody. IT IS NOT LISTED AS SEIZED EVIDENCE.  A pizzagate researcher had reported a few days prior that they had hacked Comet's website and found cp. When was the tower "shot" ?

             Too true. The article reads like every other mainstream mention of the subject. "russian trolls" "insane conspiracy theory" and my favourite "doesn't even have a basement"
It's like they are writing from an example.
