            So have you seen any of his movies?  You could say all of his movies involve cruelty, humans treating people very badly.
           </p>
           <p>
            And any evidence, he is a pedophile?  I've seen Happiness.  It's definitely not pro-pedophile.

            I saw "Happiness" in college because it looked indie and artsy. Most disturbing and disgusting movie I have ever seen. I see the actor who played the dad in that movie and never disassociate him with that role. If Solondz's goal was to evoke sympathy he badly missed the mark with that movie. Never watched another of his after that.

            Haven't even heard this guy's name in decades, but that was my first instinct about him on a Letterman appearance. He just didn't get that a bad person who does bad things isn't deserving of love, respect or understanding. The very thing that they deny others for their own selfish urges, should somehow come free to them? Fuck that. Fuck him.
