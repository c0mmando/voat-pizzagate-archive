<p>The Pedophile Child-Killing Bastards are in Overdrive.

<p>Guys, keep updated on Craig Sawyer. If Alex Jones is the tip of the spear in this fight, then Sawyer is the poison that is being delivered to the Pedophile Empire.</p>

<p>The Globalist Pedophiles are Really Scared. We just need to crank up the heat some more, guys.
Some of us might not see the light of day in the coming months and years because they will hunt us down and kill us, but because of our numbers they cannot kill us all or shut us all down.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Seems Like Mr. Sawyer and his team updated their Donation page to a new charity: GunFund.Me
They have raised about $900 dollars as of this update. I would wait until this charity is confirmed to not being deleted before donating our money to Mr. Sawyer, but as of right now it seems that the new donation site is working. Access it here:</p>

            Reminds me of that one porn artist that draws cp, torture, rape, all kinds of shite, and he has finally had his website taken down
            <em>
             not
            </em>
            by authorities or citizens concerned about the degenerate stuff he drew, but... by a fucking copyright strike for violating (pun intended) Roblox copyright...
           </p>
           <p>
            Corporations and governments don't care for degeneracies going on, unless it takes away their shekels.

             Alex didn't say it was fake news.  He gave a "lawyer" response to Alefantis and the staff at Comet Pizza.  He never denounced the Podesta email angle or the larger picture.

             It seems Alex's denouncing was all in vain. He's now funding a Navy SEAL to infiltrate and film pedophiles to create a documentary for the Public to see the pedophiles getting busted and to see how rampant the problem is.
            </p>
            <p>
             The thing is, Alex made an electronic donation to a third party crowd funding website, live on his radio show, to fund Craig Sawyer who was using this website to collect funds. After doing this, the third party website mysteriously shut down the web page preventing anyone from donating to the Navy SEAL.
            </p>
            <p>
             Speculation is now rampant that the pedophiles are afraid and doing everything they can to prevent an investigation. And also this third party website may be connected in some way, but this is unknown. Also, here's the

             </a>
             to the live show with Alex Jones that was on yesterday, 3/31/17 with Craig Sawyer.

            Alex Jones again? He is a Stratfor/CIA stooge. Why do you guys continue to shill for these phoney controlled personalites like AJ and Milo? This is getting tedious. Seems you refuse to research what others have already put on the table about what a fake AJ is. I can't upvote this thread because it legitimizes AJ. And that puts into question the rest of the story.

             Look, MSM doesn't broach the subject at all. At least Jones and Sawyer are talking it up and starting an organization to defend the kids. Time will tell whether or not any good comes from it. Until then you and Stratfor should be put on hold.

              Alex has already discredited himself by making up stuff to defend James Alefantis, and has been overt about his intention to move us in the direction he decides, which excludes anything Comet-related. HE admits he is a limited dhangout by having done this, which should signal to researchers that he is the LAST PLACE to go for anything pizzagate related. If he is funding the SEAL then he will surely have a stipulation that even if this SEAL finds something on James A, he can't report it.

            I think this is one of those Nigerian scams. Two days ago I saw a video on Twitter where a cop is calling the "IRS".  Guy answering call had foreign accent and was requesting cop send money.  The cop had a scam phone number to call.  Of course, the guy didn't know he was speaking to a cop.  The cops put the vid to public to protect against these scams.

            Isn't John McCain is in AZ and Scottsdale is pretty affluent.  There are sooooo many of these orgs that take money and the person in need get jack after all the fees and operation exp.  Like with Leukemia (Alex's Lemonade Stand is one of the few that the patient gets all the money.  Cancer Soc. only about 10% goes to research.  Like we have seen with CGI... Sawyer would do better applying for their own 501c.

             Heads up...AZ is one of the WORST states in the nation for child trafficking via Child Protective Services ( CPS).  This recent article from the AZ Republic states a child taken every 40 minutes.  I know people whose children have been trafficked by the state of AZ.

             Jones is a gatekeeper. He will divert you where the controlled opposition needs you to go. A door can't be opened if they lead you into walls. Jones is just that, a controlled opposition. I don't need others to beleive me, it's my opinion.

             I'd like to see evidence of it, and futther evidence that it goes to the right purposes. Just saying, we need to demand proof from everyone. Trust no one.

            Maybe "You Caring" (compassionate crowdfunding) needs a little investigation?  Very suspicious that the funding for vets4childrescue.org was shut down immediately after the Alex Jones interview with Craig Sawyer.

                I like small regional banks.
But just thought of something...
If an account like we are talking about is set up...
a "lone crazy" gunman would probably be sent in to shoot the Bank Manager..
Or operations officer maybe every customer in the bank...
As a warning or something..
               </p>
               <p>
                Bad guys might start acting even crazier.

The bad guys have a lot of tools that could even perplex say the Navy Seals. Too much info on directed energy weapons and the long list of people put into these programs against their will

             Remember: Pedophiles love to work around children so they become teachers, day care workers, and the like. THE SAME IS TRUE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKERS. Look up Arun Rao (implicated in the Podesta Emails) and see where he works. SMFH. As soon as I started catching on to what is happening, I began cringing whenever I heard of any organization claiming to look out for children.

              I don't know if you guys have realized yet, but Pizza is symbolic of ritual sodomy, and it is the core of the Illuminati/Freemasonry ideology. Uncovering Pizzagate IS uncovering the heart of Illuminati practices. They believe that the third eye (butthole/pineal gland) is opened in ritual sodomy. The symbolism is pretty fucking unmistakable:

              Pizza = AssPi
             </p>
             <p>
              Thus, the shilling against Pizzagate is going to be extreme. It is of the highest consequences to the brotherhood that runs the world.
             </p>
             <p>
              Pizza was likely invented purely as a symbolic worship of ritual sodomy. This is the very core of the problem. We are tearing it right out of our society.

               So they rape god in order to steal gods powers...and "god" is little children. This would also reveal that if human children are "god" or have godlike powers then that means humans are a little more powerful than they would like us to believe.  Humanity was seeded by the gods millions of years ago and still carry the god DNA so that is why they drink the blood...for the power of the gods.  And they would feel like gods by killing children of god.

               That is a lot of videos. I watched one; I understand the pizza theme in a good portion of movies. But, how does it tie to Freemasonry? Is there a specific video in this series that would explain it?

              John Eric Branchizio AKA CHEESE was contracting for DYNCORP...
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Oct 15, 2003 - Three American diplomatic personnel - John Eric Branchizio, 37, of Texas, John Martin Linde, Jr., 30, of Missouri, and Mark T. Parson, 31, of New York - were killed and one was wounded at the Beit Hanoun junction in the Gaza Strip when a massive bomb
demolished an armor-plated jeep in a convoy carrying U.S. diplomats.
             <strong>
              All three were employees of the Virginia-based DynCorp defense contracting company, and were assigned to the American Embassy in Tel Aviv.
             </strong>
             They were killed while accompanying American diplomats to Gaza for meetings with Palestinian candidates seeking Fulbright scholarships for graduate studies in the United States. The explosion occurred directly beneath the driver's seat of the second of three American vehicles.

                Adipocere, also known as corpse cheese
               </strong>
               - The macabre substance coating the torso and parts of the remaining limbs is called adipocere, a fatty, waxy material that sometimes forms from a decomposing body's soft tissues. Adipocere is familiar to investigators — it can make identifying a body and pegging its time of death tricky — but it is foreign to those of us who don't come into regular contact with decomposing bodies.
