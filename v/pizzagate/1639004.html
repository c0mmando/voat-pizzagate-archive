            I've said it once I'll say it again. ANYONE screaming about Trump who is in Hollywood is shit terrified right now. Just look back at all the other screamers..McCain, Schumer, Pelosi as example...the dirtier they are the louder the protest. Open Secrets and many other Feldman/Wood interviews make it more than clear Hollywood is a cesspool.

            This story  doe3sn't  amount to much of  anything-an actor who directs movies has all kinds  of friends, the  Polanski situation  is  troubling, but not  exactly Pizzagate either, worth noting of course, but other than Polanski I don't see the story  having  much foundation

            OK &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  look at this clip from Taxi Driver -- notice the butterfly over Jodie Foster's 'Iris' character and look at the prominent word 'PIZZA' over DeNiro's 'Travis' character.

           <p>
            Taxi Driver and Jodie Foster played a prominent role in the Reagan assassination attempt, and it was John Hinkley Jr.'s alleged 'obsession' with Foster that was his motivation.

             Hinkley's dad ran World Vision a Cia front with ties to drugs, traffiking, MK Ultra, Jim Jones, Jonestown, and David Chapman.
             <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/jonestown1.html">
              http://www.whale.to/b/jonestown1.html
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             The attorney for Jim Jones was Tim Stoen and he is still a DA in mendocino county.  mendocino hospital is where they did a lot of nazi experiments, and suprise suprise Jim Jones major backers have direct ties to IG Faben
            </p>
            <p>
             The Layton family financed Jones with large sums of money; they are related to wealthy British and German Families. Dr. Lawrence Layton was Chief of Chemical and Ecological Warfare at the infamous Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah, working later at the Navy Propellant Division, as Director of Missile and Satellite Development. Layton's Stockbroker father-in-law represented I.G.  Farben.
            </p>
            <p>
             George Philip Blakey, the man reported to have made the original $650,000 deposit on the land at Guyana, was the husband of the former Debbie Layton. His parents had large holdings in Solvay Drugs, a division of I.G.Farben.
            </p>
            <p>
             Timothy Stoen, Assistant District Attorney of San Francisco, allegedly another prominant member of the Temple. Jones used his congregation to organise a voting drive for Mayor Moscone, and was rewarded by being put in charge of the San Francisco Housing Commision. Many of Jones' followers obtained jobs at the city Welfare Department, where more recuits were signed up.
            </p>
            <p>
             Interestingly Mayor Moscone and Harvey Milk also had ties to Jim Jones and after Jonestown were being investigated until they were shot by a lone gunman and the case was closed

            Oh, I need to post something about DeNiro!!! You just reminded me. He was mentioned in a book I read ... I just don't remember what was said about him in terms of the part he played. I'll have to re-read that section if I can find it, but there is something there.

            Don't forget, friends! One of their tactics will be to try and frame good people!  Just attending a party with that horrible witch doesn't mean you are one of them, though considering how pervasive this nightmare is... Will Farrell for Pete's sake!... Don't be vigilantes, right? I started fighting this 13 years ago when I visited the Warren Jeffs Polygamist cult in Utah. What I encountered was so horrific I couldn't believe it. Over the years I finally realized what I learned was true. I helped put Jeffs in jail (he had 75 wives at the time, all married when they were 12 to 16. That's 75 equivalent boys, "sons of perdition"  that they sold as sex slaves and worse to the Saudis and Qatar).  They burnt down my house, and tried to put me in jail! Snatched me off the street in Washington and almost got me to Utah where I would be conveniently murdered... because they accused me of what they did! I barely escaped with my life. They are cornered demons, way more dangerous than animals. Here's my story:

            Deniro is a joke. The way he carried on insulting and physically theatening Trump, while saying nothing of substance, made him look like the priviledged pretentious Hollywood vain glorious loud mouth that he is. And surprise surprise, he is connected to a bunch of low life rapist, occultist, sex predators and the like. Defund hollywood and the banks Stop consuming their garbage. Shut them down. Fund nothing.

            Of course, at that time (1988), the FBI pedophile code for "Chicken lover" hadn't yet been revealed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even so, sad to see someone like Charles Grodin in that scene, delivering that dialogue.

            There was an interesting movie in 2010 called "Every Day" with Live Schrieber and Helen Hunt which centered on the husband's role as a writer where he was being constantly pushed to write more and more violent scripts, often sexual - but really of every kind.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oddly enough IMDH describes it as:  "A comedy about a New York City couple (Schreiber and Hunt) in romantic and family crises."
           </p>

           <p>
            "A comedy" is one of the last things you'd call this movie.  But it seems clear that directors, writers, actors have and are being pushed to agree to introduce ever more violent and grotesque material into movies to create a false reality for the audience -- much as MSM has been doing since the early 70's using the Drug War to frighten the public.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, if they don't agree to do it, they they're out and replaced by those more personally and deeply involved in that violent reality.

              Franco is deranged and disgusting.  Just watch child of God if you can get through it.  On second thought, don't.   Waste of good time and energy.

            From what I hear, it's a select group of idolized performers. To stay succinct, close casts with small names (such as on Orange is the New Black, Walking Dead, etc) have the least likely chance of their actors being involved in rings like this, as they are often not from the incestuous inner-ring of Hollyweird. People disinterested in acting for the money such as Keanu Reeves are also not nearly as suspicious.

            Just want to comment on Polanski that long ago Mae Brussel, who was one of our most brilliant investigators, long ago reasoned that the "Sharon Tate Murders" were actually a military operation.
Anyone familiar with her writings/videos will understand it's easy to lose a link to one of her subjects
so I'm still working on trying to find it again.  I'm sure it was TEXT and I'll try again.
Mae Brussel also wrote a good deal about Manson, which I think I can find and will be back with that link.
Manson killed no one, but the real participant "Tex" did.  Very odd situation.
But back to Tate affair, Mae Brussel linked it to CIA.  Much of this had to do with trying to defeat Youth Revolution and to introduce violence and fear into population -- especially of "hippies."
Made a note of the link and will try to get back with more info by tomorrow.
Odd how so much of the corruption we're looking at links back to government/CIA.
CIA = Gestapo = Rise of the Fourth Reich
Operation Paperclip
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip
            </a>
            According to Kay Griggs/YouTube numbers were more like 200,000 used to create the CIA, funneled into the FBI and other government agencies/NASA and to "hot spots" around the world.
Has to be understood in relationship to Operation Mockingbird and Operation Gladio.
Mockingbird was being drafted two years before the end of WWII.

             Yeah I think Manson was a patsy. I heard her interview, I think Fetzer had it on his Facebook page. Made a lot of sense.

             Edit: CIA was passing out LSD at the Monterrey Pop Festival.

              Yes -- so much it seems that we don't know about all of this -- or you find out much, much later.

              Evidently, CIA links were via Sharon's father, for one.
Control press, labor -- and the minds of the public.

              I'm still looking for the articles I've read in Mae Brussel material.  Odd how hard it is to find
something at times!

             <p>
              PS:  "Son of Sam" was another -- the guy David Berkowitz actually -- had enlisted in military
but when he figured out Vietnam, he became conscientious objector and they ended up locking
him up.  Looks like he became useful to them and that he was framed after that.
             </p>
             <p>
              Mae unraveled it all -- even down to previous connections between David and the "control" guy.

            I'm concerned that if we do properly name Cory Haim/Feldman/ets rapists before we compile enough evidence, we endanger the still-living victims in the Hollywood ring. Tread carefully, friends. There is a good fucking reason they all suddenly changed their tunes after speaking out.

             That egotistical, self-important attitude of most of the celebrities is unbearable. They think they are the center of the universe. It's also kind of funny in a way, because they still think their opinions hold weight, when in actuality regular people don't give a shit about them. Ask Hillary how well it worked out for her in the election having all the celebrities endorsing her.

            DeNiro hasn't really made any good movies in like 20 years. The "accomplishments" in that period are movies like Meet the Fockers and Silver Linings Playbook. It's a far cry from The Godfather, Deer Hunter, and Raging Bull.

            He was also the guy who received a phone call right before the documentary "Vaxxed" was supposed to air at the Tribeca Film Festival and pulled the movie from showing. Who called? Why did he pull it? The information contained in that documentary blows the lid off of the autism debate. This, in my opinion, links back to PG because of the overall picture of subverting humans to the elites need to remain in power and view everyone else as cattle.

             The most often reported pressure on DeNiro re "Vaxxed"/Tribecca came from:-
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Trustee of Sloan is President of Merck
             </p>
             <p>
              To The Truth Barrier, regarding Tribeca Film Festival’s abrupt about-face cancellation of the film Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe:
It read:
“The pressure came from the Sloan Foundation in New York, that apparently has some financial ties with Tribeca Film Festival. Worth Investigating.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr. Peter S. Kim, Ph.D. is the President at Merck Frosst Canada Ltd. since January 2003. Dr. Kim is the Venture Partner at 5AM Venture Management LLC since 2014.
             </p>
             <p>
              And . . .
             </p>
             <p>
              As for Sloan Foundation and The Tribeca Film Festival, there’s this.
             </p>
             <p>
              “The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, in partnership with the Tribeca Film Institute, provides funding for narrative features or series that are scientifically relevant, accurate, and exciting through the TFI Sloan Filmmaker Fund.”
             </p>
             <p>
              In short: A major donor to the endeavors of Tribeca Film Institute extended its reach to crush a film it neither funded, nor had anything to do with.
             </p>
             <p>
              How is that reasonable, or acceptable, in a democratic society of the arts?

             All of these entanglements always seem to back up to corrupt government.
Big Pharma becomes part of "National Security State" because it makes vaccines for soldiers
but also because it can produce antidotes for poisons like Anthrax and other chemicals used in war.  The government stepped in to protect Big Pharma from Autism lawsuits when parents began filing lawsuits on behalf of their children.  Basically, the lawsuits would have brought down Big Pharma.

              Exactly, that boat captain got hushed up pretty good. I wonder now since hearing all this illuminati hollywood stuff if the natalie wood thing was a sacrifice. It feels insane to write that

               No, Robert got away with murder.  I suspect it would have been double if he could have taken out Walken.  And, Walken is a fucking coward for not telling the truth.

             I totally don't get this. How did we get to the place where we honor and cherish celebrities we don't even know, who don't know us or care about our well-being, as much as we do our own family? I couldn't care less deZero.

              It is an amazing plan by the vultures to overtake snottywood.  They have succeeded in rounding up the "actors" and getting them to sell out.  They saw how people were drawn to movies and celebrities and now pop tarts in the music industry.  They go where humans tend to show the most interest and then infiltrate whomever with their garbage.  I would hate to have a teenager who gushes over cyrus or the like. The "followers" of the false idols are in the millions!!

              Yea I don't understand it either. You wouldn't go to a homeless person for financial advice, so why you care about a celebrity's political opinions? They pretend for a living. They are wealthy and live in the depraved, immoral bubble known as Hollywood. They are completely clueless and out of touch about what normal people want and need. It makes no sense.
