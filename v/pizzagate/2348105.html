<p>Relevance: David Geffen is the mogul that connects all the cheese.

<p>Came across the latest underage orgy scandal. Not surprisingly, DG is again involved. How involved? Well, we never know that do we? But he\'s always implicated as being around the periphery -- sort of like a ravenous vulture that never gets his fill. This time it\'s his association with Matthew Morrison that is thrown into question. The fact that vacations in Hawaii come up as an element in this story makes me wonder and a little creeped out that Morrison is taking his son. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON IN HAWAII?!!! For those who don\'t know, I posted about the Paul Mitchell Estate. It was where Michael Egan was taken by DEN Entertainment to be allegedly raped, and where The Kenyan stayed during his Christmas vacation. Link given at end of this thread. </p>
<p>Here\'s where things began with Morrison ... a CDAN blind item kicked off the shitstorm: </p>

<p>This married alliteration actor has not really been seen since his hit network show days. Yes, I mean he has done some one offs and had a recurring, but nothing like that hit show. Right now, he is trying to avoid talking to anyone about those orgies he threw for the missing A list director. I\'m guessing there were not many i.d.\'s checked at the door.</p>

            Geffen is a likely suspect in Chris Cornell's murder. Vickey is an accomplice.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also think I may have found a new lead here. Diana Jenkins. A major broker in all of this. Out her and we can utterly crush #MeToo and prove women are involved in all this too.

             If Dream Works is a part of this, then Steven Spielberg should be given a harder stinkeye. Perhaps the attack dogs are ordered to give all these ridiculous statements to the press to protect the higher ups.

            Dreamworks is also connected to Steven Spielburg too.

            Looking at Hawaii sex offender stats, you can see that Kailua (location of Paul Mitchell Estate) and Hawaii County (the entire Big Island) have the two highest concentrations.  This graph is somewhat confusing at first glance because instead of showing the number of sex offenders, it shows how many people there are for every sex offender:

           </p>
           <p>
            The names and info of 31 offenders are listed for Kailua.  Possibly at least some of these are procurers for the rich and famous who frequent the area.

            Also note that the Big Island is where Paul Mitchell's family farm is located and where his son Angus grew up.  Angus got married there in 2010 to Michelle Raab:

             Thanks so much. The question  have is why the NY Times has its tongue up Angus' ass? Seems strange. And why does he avoid mirrors?

               Then it has to be that some of the programming rituals are performed in front of a mirror. Occult rituals involve these also. It enhances what is said so they tell the magician/aspirant to stand in front of a mirror and repeat things. Scary stuff. And they do this for fame? It's not worth it.

                It's not great I know. I've been a lurker every single day since Jan '17 but for some reason, several months ago, voat went through a stage of logging me out every time I left the site. Eventually they wouldn't except my password and I had to make a new account. I was 'cleanhouse' previously. I wish I had better skills to help you all but it's best I leave that to you guys so I don't mess up the board.  Thanks to everyone for your hard work. You are all appreciated.

              Interesting about the mirrors.  You have to wonder whether there's an MK Ultra element in play.  Some of the bigwigs at the NY Times no doubt frequent Angus' property in Kailua.  He could be a ringmaster...might even be the 49th most powerful person in Hawaii. :-)

               It is. Could also be body dysmorphia. Very common amongst abuse victims.

               I believe he does have an alcohol problem. He admitted to it because of the divorce. It was one of the huge problems with the marriage. For all this nature and beauty shtick the Mitchell's used to hawk their products, they sure were fueled by a lot of rage. What good does it do to have all those acres of pristine beauty when you're gutting yourself with violent mood swings caused by god knows what?

               I found it bizarre over the years that they always say they "auditioned thousands of child actors across the country" but then end up casting a friend's kid to be the lead in the movie.
              </p>
              <p>
               I heard, some of those kids got "a part" up in Bohemian Grove.

             Just a thought...Alexa is also the Patron heiress so there’s a lot of money/success in the family. Even if the crime/rape took place at the estate, that doesn’t necessarily mean the owners of said estate had knowledge of crimes right? I’m just asking

             OMG! There you go! I think I might have the answer as to why the two hooked up and why the shampoo took off, but I was going to put it into my Part II of the Paul Mitchell thread. Hopefully, I'll get the time. Another reason I was holding off is because I can't find any info on a big piece of the puzzle. Maybe I'll just post the name and see if someone else has better luck.

               I am sorry, but I saw her in a picture today (looking up something else) with someone that rally startled me.  I already had that creep feel about her, don't know what set it off now.  But the picture really made me sit up.  Just looked for it and can't find.  For the life of me can't remember who the other two people were.  I am thinking David G but don't really know.

             Excellent point. TV productions, casting agents, and directors are key in the Feldman story since Alfie Hoffman's dad was a casting director for Laverne &amp; Shirley, Mork &amp; Mindy, Happy Days, Joanie Loves Chachi, etc. It would be no different here. UpVoat for the push in that direction.

            Outstanding Research Again!  Upvoat.  This is for sure tied to your last post, imo.  Hot dogs, walnut sauce, naked pool parties and orgies.  What could be going on here that is all wrong?  The magick ingredient is a child.  If the party was for adults only, so what.  As long as it was all consensual.  But as soon as you add a child to this Magickal Mix,  it becomes Very Sick and Perverted, Oh yes, and Illegal. #ArrestWarrant

             Exactly, there wouldn't be anything wrong. I wouldn't care about the excesses. If adults want to get it on, no objection, but if you add a kid into the mix, oh, hell, no!

             Thanks so much for your support. I really think things are starting to come out. And I found something out about DG. I'm going to do more digging, but absolutely people should be trying to find out about Hawaii.

            So according to John Doe's Twitter Tweet (btw he is a well known commenter on CDAN and highly trusted) MM was seen at the party he went to with his wife and he was kissing a guy.........hmm.  MM just came out of the closet whether he likes it or not.

              Looked it up and may be a form of Michael and mostly used here not in Hawaii and also might mean toward the sea  It might means something else to him, a personal meaning.  Also maybe his wife named him.

             Exactly. The sniffing around to find like-minded souls is worrisome. Maybe you say something outrageous like you suggest. If the other person doesn't react with code or get on the phone with Uber and schedule a pick up of kids to throw into the pool, you pretend it was a joke?
            </p>
            <p>
             I dunna. Before this, if someone mentioned walnut sauce on pasta, I'd be giving a, "HUH?" sort of look in response. Now I'd make a citizen's arrest.

             Yeah, like what is walnut sauce?  You grind up walnuts saute them in some olive oil with herbs and garlic and then drizzle it on hot dogs?  Yuck.  That's all I can come up with.  I think there has to be another meaning if you have a brain in your head.  People that don't question things that sound strange go through life with blinders on.  The thought of what it might really be is Beyond Disgusting.
