The only people reading it are a few &quot;pro&quot; and &quot;con&quot; advocates. Neither side is convincing the other. So I\'m starting a new thread with a proposal for how to move forward.</p>
<p>My argument is currently opposed by three people, not counting WIC himself: <a href="https://voat.co/user/srayzie">@srayzie</a>, <a href="https://voat.co/user/ESOTERICshade">@ESOTERICshade</a>, and <a href="https://voat.co/user/Mej777">@Mej777</a>. Other folks like <a href="https://voat.co/user/oftotc">@oftotc</a> have side concerns. I\'ll take <a href="https://voat.co/user/ESOTERICshade">@ESOTERICshade</a> first. Because the rest don\'t talk so much about WIC, I\'ll deal with them all in a separate submission.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you are calling WIC a liar because WIC hasn\'t offered you &quot;proof.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, I\'m calling WIC a liar because he told a bunch of lies. He also hasn\'t offered any evidence, but that\'s a separate issue (see below). When he says that the Johnson family donated to the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, he\'s lying. When he says Glenn Modrigrano is a mobster, he\'s lying. When he says Rotary are major donors to the Clinton Foundation, that\'s a lie. When he implies that he posted the info about the mayor of Racine and Curt Johnson, that\'s a lie. The lies matter, just as the lack of evidence matters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your rambling story has produced no proof.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proof of what? I\'ve proved lots of things. First I showed that HLI and Senate Anon both lied in claiming that ROJ/SOBIB or Adams Morgan were &quot;insider&quot; information. Then when <a href="https://voat.co/user/ababcb">@ababcb</a> defended Senate Anon, he retreated several times. First he admitted that Senate Anon didn\'t &quot;risk his life&quot;. Then I showed that Senate Anon never mentioned Sarasota at all, so his story became that the random 8chan anon that he got Sarasota from was Senate Anon <em>in disguise</em>. Three liars exposed. That\'s proof of something.</p>
<p>Second thing, I proved that WIC doesn\'t offer evidence of his claims. Now, that led to a new argument about why WIC might endanger his &quot;witnesses&quot; and &quot;victims&quot; if he did offer proof. We\'ll deal with that. But let\'s agree: I said WIC doesn\'t offer evidence because he claims to be a special insider, and WIC himself said the same, see below. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The criminal RICO investigation was obstructed and the FBI does not confirm or deny their investigations yet our sources met with them directly many times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You\'d have to be very special to get briefings on secret FBI RICO investigations.</p>
<p>Now I want to talk once more about a huge find. Twice, I posted a lead that would smash the Democrats and badly damage the Clinton machine -- <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1856593/9091111">the Milwaukee part of the Wisconsin recount</a>. WIC ignored it the first time, back in May. He sent his sockpuppet <a href="https://voat.co/user/fogdryer">@fogdryer</a> to tell us that Mike Pence is a pedo. The second time, he just said &quot;<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2215476/10914440">Jill Stein is a controlled dingbat</a>&quot;. But that\'s an evasion. I said all along that Stein\'s motive in <em>asking for</em> the recount doesn\'t matter. The point is that it exposed the last-minute rigging job. So here\'s a blatant crime by the Clinton machine <strong>in Wisconsin</strong> that we can actually prove, and yet <a href="https://voat.co/user/Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt">@Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt</a> doesn\'t care about it, won\'t say a word about it. Instead he posts stuff like this, just the other day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paul Ryan is never getting arrested. Timothy Dolan is never getting arrested. Reince Priebus is not getting arrested. Tom DeLonge is not getting arrested. Evan McMullin is not getting arrested. Message us when any big arrests happen in Wisconsin. The swamp cannot and will not be drained in our corrupt system. Paul Ryan is guarding the swamp, and those at the top are working above and beyond the reach of any effective justice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>WIC is also quite nasty. When ESOTERICshade <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2215950/10920222/10#10920222">challenged him to make more sense five days ago</a>, he condescended with: &quot;Then you cannot be Saved.&quot; Have I dismissed anyone in so pompous a way? And <a href="https://voat.co/user/4_InquiringMinds">@4_InquiringMinds</a> has asked some excellent questions about his Racine story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you elaborate on why you say this? Would they not have hubs all over the US, Europe and elsewhere? Would they risk it all by having one place that can take it all down? ... I have searched online for other racine posts and all that came up was one from last spring on lunatic outpost which simply commented on a racine post you made here. Why is this not being discussed on all the major conspiracy sites...?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this reasonable inquiry, WIC replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not trust Reddit and we do not trust you either, [name redacted]. We don\'t take this lightly. You betrayed our trust and are now joining in the hit job on us. Congratulations I hope you feel proud of yourself for working for the criminal corrupt Elite planning to enslave the world. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is unresponsive to the question <em>and</em> violates forum norms. And then there\'s this gem. You guys really don\'t see the resemblance to HLI or to Tory Smith, when his &quot;insider&quot; knowledge about the FBI morphs into wacky &quot;insider&quot; knowledge of this kind?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Their new &quot;God&quot; is forged through AI as we approach Singularity. The result is not only Global Enslavement but Eternal Enslavement with transhumanism where they control whether you have the ability to die. They will remove all sense of individualism and free will, and all hope for an afterlife.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2186974">not the first time</a> he\'s said this stuff. What &quot;sources&quot; could possibly have told him this? Why doesn\'t this smash all his credibility right on the spot? Never mind something as trivial as figuring out what David Brock spends his slush fund money on. This guy knows that the <em>real</em> evil plan of the Clinton gang is to <em>make everyone immortal and then enslave them forever to keep them out of Heaven</em>. It sure would smash my credibility, if I said that! He hasn\'t yet said Satan and Lucifer are aliens from Sigma Draconis, as Tory Smith did. But he will, in time, if you all keep giving him an audience. </p>
<p>So I\'ll say this one last time: This is the guy you\'re defending. The one who lies to you, browbeats and threatens you, passes himself off with zero evidence as another insider who <strong>just knows stuff</strong> like HLI or Senate Anon, and tells you with <strong>literally godlike omniscience</strong> that the situation is hopeless. </p>
<p>Having said that, I\'m going to move on, and be productive. ESOTERICshade wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your whole story was a fishing expedition on behalf of some worried criminals. I knew this whole enterprise of yours stunk from the beginning I just wasn\'t sure what you were fishing for. Now we know....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let\'s remove that suspicion permanently, with a joint resolution. First, because of the danger that naming sources or witnesses would harm WIC or someone else, he is relieved of any responsibility in that area. I\'m not asking him any more. I bow to his divine power as a galactic overlord to just make sh*t up. Second, we agree that WIC will stay active and not be banned. Third, to make use of his leads, while respecting his &quot;sources&quot; and &quot;witnesses&quot; and such, we\'ll make a master list. We will verify, item by item, that he has indeed never provided any evidence or any specific allegations on these corrupt organizations, individuals, and projects, all supposedly related to Racine and Paul Ryan: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>UN Agenda 2030, the Knights of Pythias, Rotary International, the Mayo Clinic, SC Johnson Corporation, Curt Johnson, the mayor of Racine, the Pilgrims Society, the Club of Rome, Kristin Bauer van Straten, secret FBI Racine criminal RICO case, Community Policing, Council on Sustainable Development, Earth Summit Rio, Zika Patent and Labs, Gates Foundation, Art in Embassies, Council on Foreign Relations, Majority 12, Timothy Dolan &amp; Racine Dominicans, the mafia, Council of 13, the Clinton Foundation, the Gates Foundation, vaccines, Racine airport, Racine harbor, Wheaton Franciscan, Freemasons, Epic Systems, Allentown PA, Cargill, Monsanto, DuPont, Dow, Bayer, Solvay, Reince Priebus, Fight to End Exploitation, I-94 Project, Racine County Coalition Against Human Trafficking, Racine Social Justice League, Fred Young, Sustainability (Satan\'s Ability), John Jeffry Louis, Christine Whitman, Henry Kissinger and Committee of 300, Les Aspin, Guy Oswary, Ron Burkle, Peter Thiel, Kabbalah, Jesuits, LDS, OTO, Scientology, Racine Interfaith Coalition, U.S. Ukraine Business Council, Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Rock Lake, Lake Michigan Stonehedge, Man Mound, Aztalan, Jeff Neubauer, Caron Butler, Yarber family</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fourth, once we have verified that WIC did not mention sources, witnesses, specific allegations, or evidence in relation to these topics, Voaters can investigate them, to figure out what WIC <em>would</em> tell us, if only he could. And I will help them! We\'ll call this pile of names The Evil League of Evil, and check off our progress each week. If we find nothing, that does not alter WIC\'s Truth, it simply means that we are inferior to WIC who after all knows about the highest level of the FBI, the Singularity, and the afterlife. But then if we find something, he will be proven correct, because by simply mentioning these names, he has proved that he already knows everything. WIC wins regardless. As he said yesterday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don\'t care about credit. We knew about Mayor Becker being a pedo before he was arrested long before anyone posted about it on voat. Same goes for Curt Johnson. ... We don\'t need to research this because we know it all directly through our sources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Together we\'ll shine a light on every word posted by WIC, review everything in detail. We\'ll turbocharge the Racine lead! And we\'ll keep at it for as long as it takes, until everyone is thoroughly sick of researching stuff that leads nowhere. Meanwhile, I still have a bunch of things to post on my project, and I trust no one will object to that. </p>
<p>So that\'s my proposal. By the way, if you wonder where I got this list, these are just the names he has dropped <strong>in the past four days</strong>.</p>',

           has gotten gigantic, and is no longer getting new views. The only people reading it are a few "pro" and "con" advocates. Neither side is convincing the other. So I'm starting a new thread with a proposal for how to move forward.

They will remove all sense of individualism and free will, and all hope for an afterlife.

           he's said this stuff. What "sources" could possibly have told him this? Why doesn't this smash all his credibility right on the spot? Never mind something as trivial as figuring out what David Brock spends his slush fund money on. This guy knows that the
           <em>
            real
           </em>
           evil plan of the Clinton gang is to
           <em>
            make everyone immortal and then enslave them forever to keep them out of Heaven
           </em>
           . It sure would smash my credibility, if I said that! He hasn't yet said Satan and Lucifer are aliens from Sigma Draconis, as Tory Smith did. But he will, in time, if you all keep giving him an audience.
          </p>
          <p>
           So I'll say this one last time: This is the guy you're defending. The one who lies to you, browbeats and threatens you, passes himself off with zero evidence as another insider who
           <strong>
            just knows stuff
           </strong>
           like HLI or Senate Anon, and tells you with
           <strong>
            literally godlike omniscience
           </strong>
           that the situation is hopeless.

           Let's remove that suspicion permanently, with a joint resolution. First, because of the danger that naming sources or witnesses would harm WIC or someone else, he is relieved of any responsibility in that area. I'm not asking him any more. I bow to his divine power as a galactic overlord to just make sh*t up. Second, we agree that WIC will stay active and not be banned. Third, to make use of his leads, while respecting his "sources" and "witnesses" and such, we'll make a master list. We will verify, item by item, that he has indeed never provided any evidence or any specific allegations on these corrupt organizations, individuals, and projects, all supposedly related to Racine and Paul Ryan:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            UN Agenda 2030, the Knights of Pythias, Rotary International, the Mayo Clinic, SC Johnson Corporation, Curt Johnson, the mayor of Racine, the Pilgrims Society, the Club of Rome, Kristin Bauer van Straten, secret FBI Racine criminal RICO case, Community Policing, Council on Sustainable Development, Earth Summit Rio, Zika Patent and Labs, Gates Foundation, Art in Embassies, Council on Foreign Relations, Majority 12, Timothy Dolan &amp; Racine Dominicans, the mafia, Council of 13, the Clinton Foundation, the Gates Foundation, vaccines, Racine airport, Racine harbor, Wheaton Franciscan, Freemasons, Epic Systems, Allentown PA, Cargill, Monsanto, DuPont, Dow, Bayer, Solvay, Reince Priebus, Fight to End Exploitation, I-94 Project, Racine County Coalition Against Human Trafficking, Racine Social Justice League, Fred Young, Sustainability (Satan's Ability), John Jeffry Louis, Christine Whitman, Henry Kissinger and Committee of 300, Les Aspin, Guy Oswary, Ron Burkle, Peter Thiel, Kabbalah, Jesuits, LDS, OTO, Scientology, Racine Interfaith Coalition, U.S. Ukraine Business Council, Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Rock Lake, Lake Michigan Stonehedge, Man Mound, Aztalan, Jeff Neubauer, Caron Butler, Yarber family
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Fourth, once we have verified that WIC did not mention sources, witnesses, specific allegations, or evidence in relation to these topics, Voaters can investigate them, to figure out what WIC
           <em>
            would
           </em>
           tell us, if only he could. And I will help them! We'll call this pile of names The Evil League of Evil, and check off our progress each week. If we find nothing, that does not alter WIC's Truth, it simply means that we are inferior to WIC who after all knows about the highest level of the FBI, the Singularity, and the afterlife. But then if we find something, he will be proven correct, because by simply mentioning these names, he has proved that he already knows everything. WIC wins regardless. As he said yesterday:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            We don't care about credit. We knew about Mayor Becker being a pedo before he was arrested long before anyone posted about it on voat. Same goes for Curt Johnson. ... We don't need to research this because we know it all directly through our sources.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Together we'll shine a light on every word posted by WIC, review everything in detail. We'll turbocharge the Racine lead! And we'll keep at it for as long as it takes, until everyone is thoroughly sick of researching stuff that leads nowhere. Meanwhile, I still have a bunch of things to post on my project, and I trust no one will object to that.
          </p>
          <p>
           So that's my proposal. By the way, if you wonder where I got this list, these are just the names he has dropped
           <strong>
            in the past four days
           </strong>

            I think Tory Smith probably believed what he was saying. I used to work with the mentally ill. It could be schizophrenia that we're seeing. Or he was just a very traumatized person.
           </p>
           <p>
            My issue isn't with him. It's the fact that the poster is using Tory to base all this on when it's obvious this man was withering away and dying. To say it was makeup and make him look like a bad person when he can't defend himself is just cruel. It also shows this person has no credibility because their evidence was shattered.

            So it seems to me that this whole theory is based on the fact that Tory Smith used the words blue aliens and galactics? Do you not realize how laughable that is?

             No, I'm calling WIC a liar because he told a bunch of lies. He also hasn't offered any evidence, but that's a separate issue (see below). When he says that the Johnson family donated to the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, he's lying. When he says Glenn Modrigrano is a mobster, he's lying. When he says Rotary are major donors to the Clinton Foundation, that's a lie. When he implies that he posted the info about the mayor of Racine and Curt Johnson, that's a lie. The lies matter, just as the lack of evidence matters.

            Yet, YOU even admitted that you cannot prove that Tory Smith didn't die. The man clearly died. You have a lack of evidence. A huge hole in your story.

            You wasted a year on investigating and this ridiculous story is what you came up with? You took a year out of your life and spent days writing all this crap out and you are not paid? Ha. Yeah right. Please! 🙄

                Well, sobersecondthought also discredited a clearly distressed man, Tory Smith, who may well be a ritual abuse survivor, and used this poor man in the nasty ploy. That shows a pure level of sadistic cruelty and disregard for human suffering that, dare I say it, only a sadistic abuser themselves, or someone working for them would do. just sayin...
               </p>
               <p>
                This pics you posted of Tory Smith are evidence enough that this man was unders serious stress and that he wasn't faking being in a bind.

                 Thank you for saying that. I've been beating myself up for thinking SST's first post of the series was good research. There's no way that Tory was faking it and my heart goes out to him every time I watch one of his videos. The thought of anyone attacking him as SST is doing makes me sick to my stomach.

                  Don't worry about it. It started as a complex ruse and quickly devolved into its own sadistic abuse ritual against the memory of Tory Smith. This is something that only a sick and twisted individual would do. Sick and twisted individuals are clever people, they have to be, in order to perpetrate and hide their sickness.

            The OP, sobersecondthought is saying that Paul Ryan and Glenn Beck were in the process of pulling a hero move to save us from the pedos. But, unfortunately, people like WIC who think Paul Ryan is a dirty politician with crooked activity going on in his district, are messing up Paul Ryan and Glenn Beck's plan to rid the nation of pedos.
           </p>
           <p>
            Paul Ryan critics are being accused of being alts of other people, liars with no proof, etc....
           </p>
           <p>
            This whole 11 page dog and pony show is to paint Ryan as a hero, laughable using Glenn Beck as some sort of proof, while causing divisioin and distrust in the forum.

            I didnt read it all but I can add a little to the part about the Johnson family and Mayo clinic supposedly being a lie...WELLLLL Jenny Johnson whom is of the Johnson clan LIVES IN PONTE VEDRA ..which is the beach area of Jacksonville very close in proximity of Mayo clinic. Their family is quite benevolent so it only seems logical that in their donating that it may have ended up going to Mayo considering that they have an eye (contacts) division right  near the clinic too...just sayin.

             thought about it and it's is not cool. But...here's the Voat problem. Like Star trek crew on a mission but there's something affecting the air onboard making everyone a psycho....controlled opposition.

             not from here just talks Luke he knows us. Has us mistrusting so other Voat posters. Go away, but no stay...we need you. To let us know when there's something else going on you no like talk bout. Like let's see..so many things...David seaman is talking about podesta, the poedsta group , Donald Trump's funny tweets. Las Vegas dead witnesses. There's other news...on PIZZAGATE it's interesting stuff about Gidon Feen, thanks

            sobersecondthought is accusing WIC of being a guy named Tory Smith that did a bunch of youtube videos about galactic blue aliens and other crazy stuff. The guys health went down hill like crazy. Supposedly the guy is dead now. sobersecondthought says the guy isn't dead but is really WIC. Also says WIC is about five other people.

            Tory Smith, who people are saying dies. According to sobersecondthought this was all done with makeup artists on a big budget and is really WIC.

            I have no idea why the mods don't delete this shit show. I guess we will all start threads attacking other members now and destroy what is left of this subverse.

I believed he was being tortured and believed him about MP . But then I had no support from anyone really on voat so I let it go .

                People don't have to like WIC. But at least see the lies and disinfo this poster has been using. What if this is all just a smear campaign against some credible people that are exposing too much? Who knows. But all of this is based on a very unbelievable theory that he even admits he can't prove. I wouldn't want my name smeared over lies or things that can't even be proved.

Have you seen this off stage camera footage with Glenn Beck rubbing Vicks Vapor Rub under his eyes to generate tears for the camera, and laughing because it is burning his eyes? Yes, the lunatic lying Glenn Beck rubs Vicks under his eyes so that he can pretend to cry for the camera.

            We are real. We are honest. We are telling the Truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are exposing the real agenda that leads to Global Enslavement and the Mark of the Beast. It is real. Agenda 2030 is only part of the plan on the policy side.
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            This person based claims he has been planning this attack against us for a year while we have been doing nothing but providing the Truth. His main premise was based on the lie that we are also High Level Insider and US Senate Anon and Tory Smith and fog dryer and others. He also claims Tory Smith was not reallly sick and instead hired a team of makeup artists to fake his illness.
           </p>

            It may be a coincidence but this guy started right after Soros dumped another $8 bilion into his evil empire.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everything we have said is true. This person has a malicious agenda to have us silences and murdered.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sam Johnson and SC Johnson were instrumental in creating the agenda of Sustainability with Bill Clinton. Ine of their main partners was John Jeffry Louis of the Plgrims Society whose heirs are deeply involved and also tied to John McCain. Johnsons also were major contributors to McCain and hedge their investment to protect both sides of the corrupt establishment. Look into the Johnsons international locations and partnerships with Cargill, DuPont, Dow, Monsanto, Bayer, Abbott, Solvay and other corrrupt companies in the circle. Curt Johnson was assaulting his daughter and others and was also a key executive at Cargill and Diversey (now Sealed Air in the Carolinas). Johnsons own the most advanced mosquito labs in the world and profited from the Zika experiment. Their partners the Rockefellers own the patent to the Zika Virus. The global chain of command is Rothschilds &gt; Rockefellers &gt; Johnsons.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine is linked with the Knights of Pythias and run by Johnsons, Racine Dominicans, Freemasons, Rotarians, RAMAC, rhe mafia, and a long line of corrupt politicians.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since we exposed the corrupt and pedo politicians in Racine they have resigned, retired, changed positions or moved away at a staggering rate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Verify it however you wish. The last 2 mayors, the last 2 city administrators, plus city attorneys, city council members, the police chief, county executives, the district attorney, and many more. The RICO cases involved all of these people and many more. The entry point was based on extreme racial discrimination and segregation but that was only the tip of what was involved and it led to many foundations and secret societies including the Clinton Foundation. All elections in Wisconsin are rigged or manipulated in one way or another. It is common knowledge. Racine is one of 13 Bellwether districts in the nation.
           </p>
           <p>
            We also exposed the fake organizations pretending to solve the problem of human trafficking including The Fight to End Expolitation, I-94 Project, and Racine Coalition Against Human Trafficking. Ashton (Chris) Kutcher backed out of events when it was exposed. Racine is a model sanctuary city with a major trafficking problem.
           </p>
           <p>
            We also exposed the corrupt Racine Social Justice League linked to Soros who then disbanded.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Clintons use Racine as the model for Community Policing and are closely linked with Jeff Neubauer who is a major player in DNC circles. His sister Kristin Bauer van Straten is a hollywood star known for playing wvil roles and is well connected in Scientology circles. Jeff is now working with the Johnson's on global education reform  through a corrupt organization called higher expectations  which is now linked with the corrupt Foxconn and Amazon deals in the area. The Podestas are from nearby area in Northern Illinois and Tony Podesta got his big break into art and politics after meeting the real players in Kenosha and Racine.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can add more later this is just off the cuff on a Friday morning.
           </p>
           <p>
            Believe who you want. One of us is trying to save the world by exposing the real truth and the real agenda through the weak link of Racine, Wisconsin and the other is on a year-long malicious attack and agenda to silence the truth about Racine, Wisconsin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you want to be Saved or Enslaved? We know the Truth and it leads to the real Emerald City of Racine, Wisconsin.

             about my criticism of Tory Smith is not that he said unbelievable things. He said so many weird and contradictory things that no one could possibly believe them all, and nobody does. The problem is that many people honestly believe that he was mentally ill, possibly as a result of abuse, and that he died of natural causes last year. I sympathize with this view, and as I said to
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/srayzie">
              @srayzie
             </a>
             , it's very much like
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpzeQ1Z3Ut0">
              when people are taken in by Hillary Clinton
             </a>
             . It's an act, but lots of perfectly nice, sane people fall for such an act.
            </p>
            <p>
             My theory is that "Tory Smith" was not mentally ill, but a paid operative of David Brock working to spread stories about Mike Pence as part of a cover up of the June 2013 Glenn Beck whistleblower event. He kept up the act for years, because Mike Pence is a massive threat to the pedosadists. He faked his death in July 2016 because two things had happened. First, sometime in the spring of 2016, the Clinton gang realized that Mike Pence would probably be Trump's VP nominee. Their plan to isolate Pence had not worked, at least as far as Trump was concerned, and so they began to wind down the time-consuming and relatively risky Tory Smith show by having him act increasingly ill. This could have been reversed if they turned out to be wrong and Pence was not made VP at the Republican convention in July.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then the second event that caused them to change their plans was the hacking and release of the DNC emails. This was a huge threat, and "Tory Smith" was needed for other disinfo projects. Now, I have a typo in a previous comment on this. I said that the timing was set by the Podesta emails. But it was the DNC ones. The DNC knew, well before Wikileaks released their emails, that they had been taken. Thus David Brock's disinfo team would have known that they had new challenges to deal with coming soon.

             At 4:10 am on July 10th, Seth Rich was assassinated. A few hours later, HighLevelInsider made his first appearance on /pol/. HLI spent many hours on /pol/ during July 10, 11, and 12, establishing his audience. (Of course many /pol/acks dismissed him, but enough listened to make that particular LARP worth doing.) Then on July 13, "Tory Smith" gave his last performance. HLI continued to hold AMAs through the rest of July and August. On July 15th, Mike Pence accepted the VP nomination and resigned as governor of Indiana. On July 24th, Wikileaks released the DNC emails.

             has challenged me to prove that Tory Smith faked his death, and to establish an ironclad connection between him and the various sockpuppets that I have exposed here on
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              /v/pizzagate
             </a>
             . I wish I could prove it, but sometimes an investigation has to go forward without hard proof.
            </p>
            <p>
             Remember when Alex Jones and Mike Cernovich reported that the Secret Service had told them that Hillary has Parkinson's? That was a situation very much like this one. There is no blood test for Parkinson's, no MRI scan, nothing like that. The only way to diagnose it is by long-term observation. So not only could Jones and Cernovich not prove that the Secret Service had told them anything, it didn't matter because even if they could, nobody could prove for certain that she really had it. Months went by and their claim remained unproven, until the 9/11 anniversary ceremony. Then (a) she collapsed on camera, and (b) there was a still photo of her doctor with her in the crowd moments before, administering a neurological test (having Hillary squeeze her hand). Their excuse that she had pneumonia is partly true, because Parkinson's patients often have chronic non-infectious pneumonia. But you don't bring your doctor with you to an event, and do neurological tests, if you just have pneumonia. So thanks to a citizen with a cellphone, we finally had our proof. A photo of "Tory Smith" walking around would accomplish the same result here. Sorry I don't have one.
            </p>
            <p>
             But I've pointed to some circumstantial evidence for "Tory Smith" being alive that I think is very strong. On Day 2 of this series, my second submission was being slid. It was a busy news day, but there were three submissions pushing it down that were from accounts that (a) had been created on almost the same day that HLI came to Voat (May 20), and (b) had been inactive for the five months since then. Suddenly they wanted to talk! All at once!
            </p>
            <p>
             What was really surprising, though, was that two of the submissions, put up a few minutes apart by
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/polwarrior1030">
              @polwarrior1030
             </a>
             , talked about "Blue Avians" and "Galactics". These are entities that Tory Smith talked about all the time, and that showed up every day in his YouTube comments.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2209420">
              Fill yourself with happiness, gratitude and appreciation and SAY IT WITH ME: Thank you galactics and blue avians for closing down the child trafficking operation.
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2209330">

            </p>
            <p>
             Now, if you study the submission and comment history of
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/polwarrior1030">
              @polwarrior1030
             </a>
             , that individual never mentioned Tory Smith, or Blue Avians and Galactics, in the past. I cannot find a single example of
             <em>
              anyone
             </em>
             mentioning the Blue Avians and Galactics on

              /v/pizzagate
             </a>
             before. Yet on the second day of my project, just entirely out of the blue, we get two very suspect threads sliding my submission, from an inactive account, that both go on and on about them. I think HLI/Senate Anon/Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt/Tory Smith was in a bit of a hurry, and made a mistake. He needed a topic to distract people, and reached back to something he was familiar with. Because he didn't have anything better suited, he used an old, inactive account in a revealing way. And when I mentioned that there were bogus submissions sliding my project report, he made another mistake. He deleted them.
            </p>
            <p>
             None of this
             <em>
              proves
             </em>
             that the guy who made the Tory Smith videos is still alive and posting here using

He kept up the act for years, because Mike Pence is a massive threat to the pedosadists.

              Why in the heck would David Brock pay someone to spread lies about Mike Pence as part of a cover up if the person he was paying comes off as mentally ill? That would make him not credible. That's absurd.

              I am going to repeat this one more time. What I am about to say PROVES this person is lying.
             </p>
             <p>
              For those of you who do not know Tory Smith, he was a YouTuber that started posting in 2015. I think some of his earliest videos got deleted. Supposedly he was abused as a child and it continued into adulthood.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you were to watch his videos, you would clearly see that he was mentally ill. Possibly from past mind control or something of that nature. I will explain why. He made videos regularly exposing child trafficking.
             </p>
             <p>
              He would name names, agencies, politicians, military officials, bases, Milabs, everything and everyone he knew to be involved in child trafficking. The White House, Congress, Pentagon, Military, Air Force, SOCOM, AFRICOM, NORTHCOM, FBI, CIA, NSA, DARPA, Obama's, Bush's, Clinton's, and the Pence's...
             </p>
             <p>
              He focused a lot on Mike Pence because Mike Pence was the governor of Indiana and Tory Smith lived in Indiana.
             </p>
             <p>
              The reason I say I think he was mentally ill, is because he would also make other claims. SoberSecondThought posted this himself so knows this.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               He uses these gifts to make a mind-boggling number of accusations. His core claim is that there are 41 secret trafficking centers around the world, created by the Bush family and run jointly by the CIA, FBI, DARPA, NSA, and various alien reptilians, insectoids, 'tall whites,' non-physical spirits, dark entities, Nazi war criminals, and so on. In these centers, high-ranking people can pay to rape and murder children (he cites a price of $41,000 per child). These are abducted in the tens of thousands from all over the world, by the Chinese, Queen Elizabeth, the Air Force, NATO, the Rand Corporation, the Vatican, the Los Angeles city council, and countless others. Tory has named hundreds of people as guilty of child rape and murder, including the Bushes, the Clintons, Obama, Rahm Emanuel, James Comey, Dick Cheney, 70 U.S. Senators, and so on.
              </p>
              <p>
               John Brennan (former head of the CIA) is a shape-shifting alien who has personally assassinated Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Whitney Houston's daughter, Paul Walker, Antonin Scalia, and Robin Williams, using a stun gun. He had to shoot Michael Jackson 42 times with the stun gun to give him a fatal heart attack.
              </p>
              <p>
               Tory is also a martyr of the first order. First, there is the torment of him psychically viewing and relaying the details of countless thousands of child murders, often including the names, ages, and favorite foods of the kids. He is "injected with weapons-grade anthrax daily" by DARPA. He has been raped in 14 of the 41 centers, including three times by Rand Paul(!), but has somehow managed to survive. The government also continually interferes with his computer, supposedly making it hard to upload his videos on a regular schedule (although 202 videos in eight months seems pretty regular).
              </p>
              <p>
               This is pretty exhausting and loopy stuff to watch, and I have not by any means viewed all 202 of his videos.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              I used to watch some of his videos because he tripped me out. I felt bad for him. I watched the poor man slowly deteriorating physically. He thought he was being poisoned for exposing everything. I think it was probably cancer or something.

              Wow. Whatever. These aren't even comparable. So I gathered some pictures to prove that Tory Smith was seriously dying and that it wasn't an act. His health declined very rapidly the last 3 months of his life. Here are 3 images.

But (a) the video isn't HD, and (b) if you're going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay a guy to say crazy slanderous things year after year, you can probably splash out for a makeup artist to help him look hollow-cheeked when it's time to end his run. I know people who do more elaborate looks just for Hallowe'en.

              This person continues to tarnish the name of a man that died. The poster even says he has no proof that Tory Smith didn't die. So he is basing his claims (this ridiculous series that he investigated for a year) on something he can't prove. On something he ADMITS HE CANNOT PROVE! On something that anyone with a brain can look at and see that the man was clearly dying. It wasn't an act. It wasn't makeup. He clearly lost a lot of weight and was getting weaker and weaker every week.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have stated over and over that I don't have an opinion on rather or not HLI, WIC, and everyone else is the same person. I am not defending them. What I do know is that what this poster bases his claims on is a LIE. He's working very hard to discredit posters from here, reddit and 4 Chan I believe. This is DISINFO and a limited hangout. This person has lost all credibility. He continues to write me trying to prove he's right and tries to use his manipulation tactics taught to him like I'm stupid. Analyzing me and my thought process. It didn't work. It won't work.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm tired of wasting my time having to repeat myself because this PAID SHILL won't accept defeat. He fucked this project up. His gig is up. He isn't getting his October bonus check. He needs to put in some applications somewhere else because he SUCKS. He didn't expect someone to know all about Tory Smith. Well, he FAILED.
             </p>
             <p>
              I encourage anyone believing this "series" to not base your opinion off of anything to do with Tory Smith because he may have talked about some of the same topics as HLI and the others. Tory talked about MANY things like that.
             </p>
             <p>
              I find it sick that he continues to slander the name of someone who died and cannot defend himself. Tory Smith had loved ones. The shill poster is so disrespectful and heartless.
             </p>
             <p>
              If he doesn't have solid proof, like he admits, he should STFU and not post this crap here. Go back to the drawing board. I think this person needs to be banned from the Pizzagate sub. I can't believe that this has gone on now for what? 11 days?!
             </p>
             <p>
              So that I don't have to waste all my time continuing to repeat myself every time this shill pings me, I am just going to save this and paste it every time. I have better things to do. The only reason I'm commenting right now is that I don't want you guys fooled by a deceptive shill that disrespects the dead and cannot accept defeat.

              Holy crap! I never believed any of his angel/alien stuff , but like you said I sympathized with his plea because of all the other victims that have been ignored. I posted a few vids of TS back in 2016 but never was able to come to a conclusion myself .

                It's you who makes absurd leaps of judgement and calls shill like you know shit.  Miss "I never knew people disliked Jews til voat lol" now every single post mentions them as principal players.

                <p>
                 I wasn't lying. I wasn't into social media or forums so I never heard all this stuff about Jews. That's better than being a hater like you who is a Donkeyhote impersonator.
