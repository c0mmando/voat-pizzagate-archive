<p>Those not familiar with Rodney Alcala, his first victim was 8 years old. It is believed that he killed up to 130 people. </p>
<p>What i find very interesting is this little tidbit from bizarrepedia:</p>

<p>The murder took place in 1968 and marked his first known crime. Alcala fled the state to avoid the arrest, and the federal agents placed him to FBI’s most wanted list. Using a new name John Berger, he enrolled in the New York University film school under the famous film director and producer Roman Polanski</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What draws my attention to this, is that Polanski and Alcala raped in very similar ways: both subdued the victims and sodomized them. Polanski was raping underage girls at the same Time Alcala was murdering and killing women from the ages of 8 to mid twenties.</p>
<p>And now we have a connection between the two, Alcala took a class with Polanski. What a coincidence! What is also interesting is it is very very hard to find records of when Polanski was teaching at new York. Granted, they are overshadowed by new rape allegations from around the same time Alcala was there. </p>
<p>I am curious as to how many sex offenders took Polanski\'s classes. I am also wondering if the dating game knew that Alcala was a sex offender, or if he had sex offender connections that got him on that show. There are allegations that a lot of Alcala\'s crimes were covered up, he was a photographer, he took a lot of pictures of his victims after he killed them. We are told that those are his trophies, but how would we know if he was selling them, and who was buying them? this was also the era of underground porn.</p>',

            I am sure there are many in NY and CA.  that would scrub or hide records for Polanski and Alcala.  They do it on the internet everyday.  Amazing. I had no idea Alcala murdered that many.  Horrifying.  Polanski was perhaps passing on tricks of the trade. Alcala took it to the next level.

             I have always wondered why there are so many unknown victims that are unaccounted for. One explanation is that there is some cover up to hide forced prostitution, or to protect prostitution rings.
            </p>
            <p>
             What gets even more intriguing is how interconnected that community is. Polanski was in several communities, the academics, the Jews, Broadway, and Hollywood. As a result, we find that he had connections to MORE sex offenders, direct connections. These never get brought up for some reason.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am suspecting that there is an open cover up of Polanski's crimes because he is too visible, and this may be a linchpin that removes a lot of people.

              I am sure you have heard the saying about the Illuminati, it is a club, and you are not in it.  Well, I believe this is a club, and I don't want to be in it.  It is their own little world and secret club.  Think Eyes Wide Shut.  Your may think your eyes are wide open, but they are still shut because they make sure there are things you don't see.  They have created a well oiled and protected club.

               Your answer is closer to the truth than the previous one IMHO. Let's not forget 2 things. 
1) Polanski's films generally make $$$ for their investors. Easy to do if you have "a name" based on a track record that can carry you through quite a few failures. Notoriety brings pap attention. Remember, "There is no such thing as bad pap attention. That's because the paps will still want to cover you. Even those who really, really want to see you fail will be talking about you, giving you free pap attention. Then you'll continually get hired."
              </p>
              <p>
               2) Rumors on the internet that the real reason for Sharon Tate's death is linked to Roman's real super powerful role in the Illuminati which encourages the darkest acts.
              </p>
              <p>
               Wonder if it's power will ever be curbed when Gen Flynn publishes the list of 400 Americans running the international pedo rings. Achieved with the direct collaboration of the Russians, the evil blackmailers are from the elite circles of DC, NY, and Hollywood. Don't think they're not also involved with a lot of other machinations around the world.
