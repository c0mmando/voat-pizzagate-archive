<p>Under the code name Operation Ghost Stories, the FBI had been working the ring for a decade. Its targets had burrowed in along the Acela Corridor between Boston, New York, and Washington DC. They lived normal daily lives as Americans to attend universities, run businesses, marry, and conceive and raise children to infiltrate society and subvert government institutions. <strong>One of the SVR agents had stolen the identity of a six week-old Canadian baby who had died in 1963</strong>. That prompted the Ghost Stories code name. The ring inspired the FX network’s television series, “The Americans.”</p>

            This is misinformation.  The Bribery scheme did not involve Hillary at all and it was announced by the FBI after she had left office.

            Does anybody know if Assange is still supposed to release something huge tomorrow? Or was the Obama Administration Russian Uranium story what Assange wanted them to admit by the 21st or he would? I was hoping there would be a lot more.

             The Assange tweet that talked about a release on the 21st was from a fake Assange account that unfortunately a lot of people still believed.  Nothing is happening tomorrow.  But if something does I will happily admit I'm wrong.

               Well, we shall find out.  It is rather surprising that what he wants is coming out.  I am pretty convinced he is no longer in command.  Very sad.

                 I would not be surprised that some are going to try to make it seem like he is still alive.  But we shall see.  No one wants it to be true more than I, but we have to admit how horrible they have been lately.  The LV shooting, The Cal Fire, and the Controlled Storms.  Taking out Assange would be a piece of cake for them.

            Toensing's client was an American businessman who says he worked for four years undercover as an FBI confidential witness. Toensing said he was blocked by the Obama Justice Department, under then Attorney General Loretta Lynch, about testifying to Congress about his time as an informant for the FBI. He contends that he has pertinent information that the Russian's were attempting to gain access to former President Bill Clinton and his wife, then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to influence the Obama administration's decision on the purchase of Uranium One, Toensing said.

            Is this what Obama meant, when he said he "needed more time"?
