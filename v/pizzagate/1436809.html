            My gut tells me that he may be behind it all. He has been Vice President for 8 years. It seems like the President's job is to look outward at the nation and the world, while the Vice's is to look inward at the White House. I know that he was one of the youngest senators ever, maybe that was because of some special favors he was able to perform?
