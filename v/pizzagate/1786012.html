&quot;Becker, who is married and has two children, is charged with attempted second-degree sexual assault of a child under 16, possession of child pornography, child enticement, use of a computer to facilitate a child sex crime, attempt exposing a child to harmful material and misconduct in office. The charges carry a maximum penalty of more than 114 years in prison and $370,000 in fines.&quot;</p>

<p>Seattle\'s homosexual mayor, Ed Murray, who is accused of molesting three teenage boys in the 80\'s, is now being sued by one of his victims.</p>

<p>Murray is running for e-election this year and denies everything, but there are two other victims who have surfaced producing similar details to the accuser in the lawsuit: details about Murray’s 1980s Capitol Hill apartment, Murray’s phone number at the time, and a description of the mayor’s genitals: both D.H. and Anderson describe Murray as having an unusual bump or mole on his penis and bright red pubic hair.</p>

            I remember months ago when this all started to be investigated an anonymous insider said that all roads led to Racine. Then when Reice Preibus and Paul Ryan were both out in positions of influence the same anon said that nothing will happen if they are still there. The blackmail is severe. Family members could die. They don't kill their puppets-they need them in place.

            That is where Paul Ryan and Reice Preibus are from and the history of Deep State Masonic control of every elected official  spans decades. remember the Franklin investigations where nobody was charged? I have been freaked that both Ryan and Preibus are anywhere near President Trump -i believe both are blackmailed and owned by the dark forces.

            Many involved were paid off in the process, and the court systems in Wisconsin are corrupt and controlled by Freemasons, Knights of Pythias, and other secret societies. Look into the nanny next. Then look into local foundations including The Fight to End Exploitation. It is all a cover up working with the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative, Reince Priebus, Paul Ryan, John McCain, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Ashton Kutcher, and others involved. Racine is linked to every other hub of Pizzagate and trafficking from Denver, DC, Pennsylvania, Arizona, New York, and Chicago to Haiti, Ghana, Norway, UK, Netherlands, Belgium and others.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is much more to all of this. Everything is connected back to Racine, the birthplace of Sustainability and Agenda 2030, and they are all tied to the Rockefellers, Rothschilds and other elite players.

            When the FBI and DOJ finally do their job and begin indicting the evil elite behind Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, we can all celebrate together. We need to force them to restore the rule of law to America by putting a spotlight on Racine, Wisconsin. It is an undeniable hub of criminal corruption linked to the most powerful players in the nation and globe.

             That is all correct and only a small portion of what is being hidden in Racine and Wisconsin. Trafficking, laundering and racketeering are standard practice in Racine and Wisconsin linked to the mafia and secret societies. Paul Ryan was made personally aware of the criminal corruption in his district and turned his back on his constituents to cover up for the global elite who are involved in Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

               All of the above. Ryan and Priebus are the front door salesmen while the real evil is going on in the back room. Ryan and Priebus both look the part of a conservative Eagle Scout, and no one would normally suspect them being involved in Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. It has been rumored by many including Robert David Steele that Priebus is gay, and there are similar rumors about Paul Ryan. They are not normal men, and the entire system in Wisconsin is filled with pedos, boy scouts and satanic ritual abuse within their secret societies and clubs. Similarly, Obama is rumored to have gay relations, whether you believe Joan Rivers' comments or not, along with Rahm Emanuel the mayor of Chicago, and both have been alleged as frequent patrons of bath houses where gay activities are commonplace. Who else fits this same strange behavior? John Podesta. We already know Robby Mook is gay, but the behavior of some involved appears to be more of a strange ritualistic perversion than simply being gay.

               In Racine, there are similar operations going on, and everyone is being blackmailed, bribed, extorted or threatened to keep everything quiet and under control. Detention centers, shelter groups, healthcare groups, churches, and organizations are involved. It is a sanctuary city, with completely corrupt and complicit authorities at all levels. They will look the other way while the extreme criminal abuse is going on. Murders and scandals don't get solved in Racine, they get covered up.

                 This barely scratches the surface but is relevant. Racine and Kenosha are closely connected. The entire area is a cesspool of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

            There is nothing funny about this. This is very real, very serious and very dangerous for those of us who know the truth. The death threats, gang stalking, and retaliation are real. They are very afraid of an investigation into Racine, Wisconsin.

             Great to see you back! Seems like things are heating up in Racine area.  Keep us posted if you uncover anymore.  I have a feeling there will be more as the canaries start singing.

              A lot has been happening in Racine. More is being discovered each day. It is overwhelming.
             </p>
             <p>
              They are desperately trying to cover it all up because people were starting to ask too many questions about Racine. The puppet masters have forced their puppets to all resign and they are bringing in more corrupt outsiders to replace them. Just in the past months an alarming number of local officials and authorities have suddenly resigned under allegations of criminal corruption including the corrupt mayor and city administrator (being replaced now), the corrupt district attorney (replaced with another corrupt district attorney), the corrupt city attorney (replaced by another corrupt city attorney), corrupt members of city council, corrupt county officials, corrupt reporters, corrupt officials and authorities including the police chief who was deemed as untrustworthy by the courts in a RICO lawsuit, and others.
             </p>
             <p>
              They are all resigning in the middle of the biggest development deals in the history of Racine which have been infested with criminal corruption, racketeering, embezzlement, extortion, bribery and other crimes. Millions have gone missing, and millions have been handed out to members of the inner circle who are involved.
             </p>
             <p>
              We need the spotlight on Racine now more than ever. The local media is absolutely corrupt and controlled, and the local court systems are ruled by members of the secret societies engaged in Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

             This is the tip of the iceberg. Now look into the recent RICO case in Racine and who gave illegal campaign contributions in a racketeering scheme - notice anything? Then look into the resignation of the current corrupt mayor and city administrator, the past pedo mayor, donations to the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative, Sustainability, Community Policing, Vaccines, Viruses, and Agenda 2030. Look into the Knights of Pythias and the common theme. Look into the Pilgrims Society, and links between the Rothschilds, Rockefellers and Racine. Look into the mafia ties to Racine and Milwaukee through Chicago. Look into the mafia ties to Kenosha. Look into the ties with John McCain and Arizona State University. Look into the ties with Ashton (Chris) Kutcher and Mark Ruffalo. Paul Ryan, Scott Walker and Reince Priebus are covering up a cesspool in their backyard.
            </p>
            <p>
             Racine is an epicenter for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. It needs to be put under the spotlight.

            Johnson's is disgusting and so are the owners.  The company left bad medicine that they knew about still being sold to children.  They also gave us the baby powder problem as well,  Let's hope that others come forward.  We know there must be others.  There is never just one. Sadly, when there are slaps on the wrist, it keeps others from telling their story.  Shame and Fear of Publicity is the Abusers Friend.

             There is much more to this story. See Agenda 2030 and vaccines and viruses, as well as ties to global conglomerates and power players including DuPont, Dow, Monsanto, Cargill, ConAgra, and many others.

             It is a global system of corruption, blackmail, bribery, and enslavement. Everything ties back to Racine, Wisconsin.

              You may be on to something.  There are many hubs involved, but Racine may be a really big player.

              Thank you for that.  This went right to my heart.  I used to babysit a little girl many years ago and the mother always brought over that baby powder.  So I used it.  What did we know?
Now when I see the ads telling people to contact a lawyer if you have problems stemming from the powder, it tugs at my heart.  I have tried to contact the mother but cannot find her. This must stop.  They are getting to our children all sorts of ways. I am not one bit surprised that he is guilty of sex abuse.  The perverted ogre.

               It appears the problem is related to the female pubic region, but if it causes cancer there, it can't be great for armpits and other places, I would have thought.  I  wonder if Johnson have known about it for a long time and sat on the information - like the tobacco companies and smoking - or whether they moved as soon as problems were suspected.  Presumably there is a [prominent] warning on powder now - must check next time I go shopping.  It probably should have just been withdrawn or reformulated.

            Not to confuse things, but this may add to the rabbit hole.  There is a town by the name of Rothschild in Wisconsin.  The census count seemed a little strange to me, but I am not too good in that dept.  It seems that whenever we discover something like in this case being Racine, the rabbit hole gets wider and deeper. Rothschild is a village in Marathon County, Wisconsin, United States. It is part of the Wausau, Wisconsin Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 5,269 at the 2010 census.[6] Rothschild is the northern terminus of Interstate 39, which starts in Normal, Illinois.  I have not found any connection to the Rothschilds that we know, but am still looking.

             The Rothschilds are in and closely connected to Racine, as are the Rockefellers and other powerful elite families. Sustainability, Agenda 2030 and the Pilgrims Society are a few of the key links. This is why Racine is so important, along with its deep ties to the mafia, secret societies, satanism, and extreme corruption. It is also the dialysis capital of the world that is a hub for trafficking and harvesting sitting on one of the largest fresh water supplies in the world.

              God, I have always hated Paul Ryan. I hope he goes down, and really big.He wants to take take take from us, but he had no problem taking money when his father died.  That widow's peak is a perfect crowning touch, No?

                Racketeering is one. Boy Scouts and ties to John McCain are another. It is rumored he may also be in the Knights of Pythias although we do not have confirmation on that. Look into Arizona State University and it's connections to Racine and other Universities linked to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption (Penn State is another obvious one). University of Wisconsin is another along with Parkside and Gateway in Racine County. PACs play an important role as well, such as the Club for Growth.
               </p>
               <p>
                Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus, Ron Johnson and Scott Walker are covering up a massive cesspool and hub for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. How else would Paul Ryan become so powerful? He was groomed.
               </p>
               <p>
                Additionally Paul Ryan was personally and directly made aware of criminal corruption in his district by his constituents, and turned his back on them as Loretta Lynch, Jim Comey, Andy McCabe, Peter Kadzik and others stonewalled RICO investigations in Racine. Paul Ryan loathes his constituents, and is a traitor to the United States of America.

             Keep digging. There are many foundations and generations of groups in Racine that are all linked to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Racine is also closely tied to the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative, along with Anthony Weiner, Chuck Schumer, Robert Byrd and others in the Knights of Pythias and other secret societies.
            </p>
            <p>
             Look into the locations that are linked to Racine. Do you notice a pattern yet?

            Also adding the L. H. Q. O.  CIA linked website where the IP address was linked to Wisconsin.

            A note I hope everyone reads that Evelyn de Rothschild (married to Lyn) just put out an article stating the US has to take out Assad in Syria right before the alleged "chemical attacks" which are already being proven false flags. Trump switched literally overnight so he is being blackmailed or worse.

             Thank you. Your support is appreciated. This is extremely scary and dangerous, and we have been victims of death threats, stalking and other attacks. All we are asking for is a full proper investigation, and the FBI has proven to be either completely corrupt or complicit to corruption. Jim Comey and Andrew McCabe need to be removed from their positions immediately and prosecuted for potential crimes to stop investigations into Racine, Wisconsin.
            </p>
            <p>
             The whole truth will come out with a full and proper federal investigation, and it is coming out regardless one way or another. We are in the midst of an in-depth private investigation, and more evidence is being discovered daily. This is an epicenter of criminal corruption tied to the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Clintons (including the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative), and other extremely powerful players involved. We believe Trump may be compromised either through his own relationships or through his children's. This is why Racine is so important - if Trump cannot demand full investigations into corruption in Paul Ryan and Reince Priebus' backyard and see them for what they really are, then Trump cannot be trusted to drain any swamp.
            </p>
            <p>
             We have said it from the beginning, and everything is starting to come together. The past mayor was arrested for pedo crimes, the entire area has major problems with criminal corruption, pedos, human trafficking, organ harvesting, satanic ritual abuse, torture and murder, gangs, gang stalking, corrupt law enforcement, corrupt media, the mafia, and secret societies. Racine is also a sanctuary city with a fully controlled airport, interstate, and harbor.
            </p>
            <p>
             The current corrupt mayor of Racine just announced his resignation along with his cousin the city administrator, shortly after the city attorney, district attorney and others all resigned under a cloud of allegations involving criminal corruption. This follows a string of corrupt insider deals including the biggest development deals in the history of Racine that were pushed through with racketeering, collusion, fraud, bribery, extortion, embezzlement, bid rigging, vote rigging, abuse of power, conspiracy, meeting law violations, open record violations, stalking, slander, intimidation, retaliation, and murder.
            </p>
            <p>
             Paul Ryan and Reince Priebus are closely involved along with members of both the RNC and the DNC. John McCain and others are working to cover up the trafficking epidemic with Kabbalah and Freemason elite like Ashton (Chris) Kutcher. They even formed a local organization in Racine to cover it up called Fight To End Exploitation - Racine, Wisconsin - fighttoendexploitation.org. Fight To End Exploitation helps prevent conditions that foster human trafficking in southeastern Wisconsin through education, training and outreach efforts. Guess who is behind this group? Known pedos who are involved in criminal corruption, racketeering and other crimes. There was a recent RICO case in Racine that was settled under duress, fraud and criminal collusion involving attorneys who failed to disclose conflicts of interest. The FBI has slow-rolled and stonewalled subsequent investigations, and the local authorities are directly involved in the corruption and conspiracy.
            </p>
            <p>
             We been working diligently behind the scenes on a full investigation. The results are alarming. We need your help. Racine, Wisconsin is a cesspool of corruption linked to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

              Today Session's had a new clip stating the actions they are immediately enacting regarding illegals and enforcement.He seems to be a man on a mission,  Anyway, my ? is, do you have.anything compiled that would help us put together a legend or action board... it would help us tremendously which I'm sure some of the info we have could either fill in blanks or at the very least link up so it flows. ( sort of like the "all roads lead to ROME," analogy) I'm game if this puts the icing on the very rotten cake!!

              Your courage is amazing. Brought you up earlier today on this post in the beginning because your posts were burned in our brains. The persistently you have had is stunning. You named the right two Comey &amp; McCabe that need to go. Put Trey Gowdy in charge. Let's clean out the swamp

              aaaaand..... your point is? He did back away and said he wouldn't cover it anymore.. got scared.. maybe leaned on by Alefantis mates.. has stayed away from Alefantis and is just covering what hes allowed to cover. As ive said before also.. hes an opportunist.. is making a good income off patreon from all of this now.. he helps bring awareness.. his motivations are mixed.

                It is going on all over Wisconsin, and they are covering up murders in Milwaukee like they are in Chicago. They are all sanctuary cities with heavy mafia and gang ties.
               </p>
               <p>
                One of the many reasons why Racine is so important beyond its proximity and ties to elite financiers involved is because of the controlled harbor, international airport, interstate and LEO. The corruption and control through blackmail, extortion, bribery, murder and other means is pervasive and known by everyone. No one will speak up because they know what happens, just like inner city witnesses won't rat on gangsters. They are using MS-13, latin kings, mafia and other gangs to do their dirty work.
               </p>
               <p>
                We know Racine is a hub for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, and we know the entire state of Wisconsin is controlled by groups of secret societies and network through the establishment and major industries. There is a reason why Paul Ryan is so powerful and a reason why no local, state or federal authorities will investigate RICO and criminal corruption linked from Racine to the Clintons, McCain, and the most powerful organizations, businesses and people in the world.
               </p>
               <p>
                George Webb refuses to include secret societies in his investigations, but they play a major role in this and cannot be ignored. Specifically start with the Knights of Pythias and Pilgrims Society. There are many more. Kabbalah is another involved, and Ashton Kutcher knows why.

                 George Webb mentions the double double garrotting again.  @ 1:13:20  Linked to undocumented Pakistanis working at meat packing plants - Plainsfield Indiana - Evensdale(?) Wisconsin - identical double murder.

              David Seaman is too poor to be trusted, considering his opportunist approach. He is not a victim of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. He will sell out to whoever will pay his rent, and is afraid of anyone who threatens to sue him for the little money he has. He has followed the same disinformation patterns as Alex Jones has throughout Pizzagate. Prove us wrong David Seaman, and we will support you. But you can't, and neither can Alex Jones. At least George Webb mixes in real investigative research with their disinformation. The comments about George Webb (George Sweigart) from Gwen Jackman (Wendy Doster) are certainly interesting. It is hard to trust these people. They all seem too connected, and seem to avoid many of the same aspects of the Real Pizzagate, and instead focus on the narrow Fake News and Fabricated Victim aspects.
             </p>
             <p>
              Racine is a litmus test for Donald Trump's real intention to drain the swamp, and it also serves as a barometer for David Seaman and George Webb and other "pizzagate investigators", whether they will put a spotlight on Racine, Wisconsin. If anyone can get them to investigate and report on Racine, it could help prove whether they are controlled opposition or not. George Webb got close when talking about the rat lines from Chicago through the Quad Cities and up through Rockford and Wisconsin regarding Mango-gate, but stopped short and moved on to other areas of the investigation. Very little faith can be placed in George Webb, David Seaman and even Donald Trump as all are more likely to be compromised than genuine.
             </p>
             <p>
              Unlike so many other dead ends or shill leads, Racine is not a honeypot or disinformation. It is a truly genuine cesspool and swamp tied to every aspect of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. The story about Racine has not changed in any way, and only has been supported by everything that has transpired over recent weeks and months. Racine is Paul Ryan's district. It is Reince Priebus' home area. Scott Walker doesn't even have a college degree. The entire state is ran by corrupt Freemasons and other secret societies. The entire system is a network of blackmail, bribery, extortion, racketeering, embezzlement, abuse and intimidation.
             </p>
             <p>
              We are working on a much more complete picture of this, but need help. We need the spotlight on Racine to see why the FBI and DOJ are refusing to do their job and convene a grand jury to being prosecutions related to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. How many FBI and DOJ agents are members of Freemasons, Kabbalah, Rotary, United Way, Knights of Pythias and other groups involved? Why is Donald Trump afraid to force investigations and drain the swamp? Was Donald Trump compromised with Epstein and others, or was the apple of his eye, his own daughter, compromised as a target of Global Criminal Corruption? It is looking more and more that way each day.

               I think most of us sell out to a greater or lesser extent to whoever will pay the rent.

               I hope you are using vpn [at the very least] and considering how best to conceal your identity.  I imagine TPTB are all over this and show every sign of playing hard ball.

              <p>
               The fact that half the city council and officers have had to resign is clearly significant.  Perhaps David, George and Alex would respond to anonymous tips and cover Racine and Wisconsin.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you have more information, you should consider dumping it far and wide, simply as a safety measure.  And maintain your anonymity.  These people are evil.

             Maybe gassing all those poor innocent children in Syria WAS the Deep State making good on a threat to Trump.  Maybe that's how they are blackmailing him into doing their bidding. So sick if true, and what the hell can he do about it????

              Possibly...Something is definetly wrong about the whole situation. There are no pictures of the tomohawk damage or anything. Saw the same guy interviewed on CNN the FOX news about living through this in Syria. He had an Iphone and spoke with a British accent.
Very strange.

               The timing is suspicious too.  Deep State was about to get exposed via the Susan Rice scandal, and nobody's talking about that anymore.  Also would explain why Trump was so genuinely rattled when he spoke about the CW attack. Let's face it, if everything we've researched is true, CIA is everywhere and can do anything, and will go to great lengths to hide the truth.

                Yes this definitely intentional for anyone who thinks otherwise you are a fool. The entire Deep state spying operation was unveiled in the Susa Rice story which was going to lead to Obama. He fled the country. Their have already been attempts to serve him legal papers no one can find him.

             "This all links to Racine, Wisconsin where the Knights of Pythias held their historic parade. Racine is Paul Ryan's district, and it is a complete cesspool of secret societies, criminal corruption, racketeering, trafficking, abuse and other crimes. It all ties to Agenda 2030, viruses, vaccines, water control (the new oil), and the elite system of blackmail, bribery, extortion and collusion. Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus, Scott Walker and others in Wisconsin are the "boy scouts" covering up the incredible evils behind the curtains. Many judges, district attorneys and the attorney general are all in the same Freemason and related clubs and secret societies, and Loretta Lynch personally stonewalled federal investigations into Racine and Wisconsin.

             Racine, Wisconsin is the domino that will work better on Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. It is all connected."

              That's more than I could get him to tell. Well done! Right about the water. I see the watersheds in the midwest and northeast where they are placing all the refugee immigrants and it gives pause. Coming straight down from Canada. Here's a watershed map. You will find if you overlay refugee resettlement sites to be very interesting. Lots of cool maps about water here

              Of course she did... isn't that what a DOJ AG standing up for clients, the American people, is supposed to do? (her more recent BS speech).  Overcome terrorism with 'love', not enforcement of laws.  Have 'regrettably public' secret  meetings with former POTUS on tarmac to NOT discuss Clinton email investigations...?

              We have plenty of information and evidence. It is overwhelming. Some has been shared with others, some has been posted on here, and the rest is being developed into a full investigative report which is being added to daily. The corrupt mayor and his cousin just resigned in the past few weeks amidst the allegations of criminal corruption tied to the most powerful people in the area. This is no coincidence. This is an attempted cover up.
             </p>
             <p>
              Look it all up even in the corrupt local Racine newspaper the Journal Times. Mayors don't resign unless they are forced to. The last mayor was arrested for pedo crimes, the last city administrator tried to commit suicide following sexual harassment claims, prominent judges have ended up dead in the river, there is a long list of satanic murders and abuse of children including at local detention centers, and Racine is a hub for trafficking including of undocumented immigrants and refugees. It is a haven for the mafia and secret societies, and a sanctuary city. It is one of the most corrupt places in America, tied to every other hub of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption from Pennsylvania, Denver and DC to Haiti, Ghana, Norway, UK, Netherlands, and Belgium.
             </p>
             <p>
              Racine is the key to solving Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. We need everyone to put the spotlight on it until a real investigation brings out the true story that we have uncovered. The world will be shocked. It is time to rise up together.

                That newspaper is bought and paid for by those involved in Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Everything is ran by those in charge. You can still find some articles, but you won't find many comments due to extreme censorship and cover ups.

                  That may be outdated information. The owner of the The Journal Times is Lee Enterprises and they are an extremely corrupt organization peddling Fake News and heavy-handed censorship. They do not disclose their conflicts of interest and were instrumental in connections from Racine to Quad Cities that involved rigged development deals for insiders including the owner of the building Lee Enterprises rents from. Nothing is printed in the local paper without the approval of the key business influences in the area. Follow the money and it won't take long to figure out who that group is.

               Just the mayor? I thought he was saying Racine was the center of it all (and I guess why I didn't pay much attention bcuz, really? Racine?)  But it could be a great place to hide the "queen bee" of an operation because who would think to look there? It does have shipping ports and railroads

                Pretty much the top of the town corporation.
               </p>
               <p>
                The mayor just resigned following his perjury in a federal RICO case. His departure follows the recent resignations of the city administrator, the city attorney, the district attorney, several council members, several judges, and many other prominent local "leaders", not too long after the past city administrator who tried to commit suicide, the police chief who threatened to leave town only to accept a big raise and special gifts to stay, the past police chief who was deemed "untrustworthy" by the court system in a RICO case, a history of pedo crimes including high profile cases and the past mayor, a history of secret societies and mafia corruption, a history of satanic ritual abuse, and major problems with drug, human and organ trafficking.

                  Correct. Everyone in Racine works for the few employers in the area, so everyone is easily controlled and blackmailed, bribed, extorted, or threatened. Everyone also knows what happens when you raise questions or concerns. You end up dead in the river like prominent judge Dennis Barry did. It was not a suicide, and it was covered up without any investigation. The DA and medical examiner were closely involved along with many others.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  They get people jobs, then bring them into local clubs, boards, organizations or foundations. They control banking, insurance, healthcare, media and virtually every industry in the area. Everyone knows everyone else, and they either have dirt on everyone in the city or they try to create it. There are only a few who are not controlled, and they are doing everything they can to slander, stalk, retaliate and threaten anyone who raises questions or concerns as an example to intimidate others. They are working desperately to censor and hide the truth to avoid real investigations. The FBI has more than enough evidence from the recent RICO case and many other related cases in Racine, and Loretta Lynch personally assured people of a full investigation before actively stonewalling it on her way out. It is now a full blown cover up. Loretta Lynch, Jim Comey and Andrew McCabe should be prosecuted for treason, and our own government agencies entrusted to uphold the law are acting on the same level as terrorist organizations. How can anyone work at the FBI or DOJ and not be demanding that they are removed from their positions? Who will restore the rule of law to America? Is Trump incompetent, corrupt or compromised? Is he too stupid to see the pure evil that is hiding in the backyard of Paul Ryan and Reince Priebus?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Everything that is happening on the global and national scale is being tested and perfected in Racine. It is an incubator for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption involving blackmail, bribery, racketeering, embezzlement, bid rigging, sustainability, population control, viruses, vaccines, private prisons, community policing, sanctuary city and crime havens, fake news, trafficking, organ harvesting and satanic ritual abuse. It is a testing ground linked to the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, UK and Dutch Royalty, DuPont, and many others at the top.

             Back when they wanted to establish the Fed, all they had on President Woodrow Wilson was adultery. Adultery seems to be a national pastime now, so they had to go deeper into the sewer.
