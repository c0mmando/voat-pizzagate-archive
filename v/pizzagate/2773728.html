<p><strong>Thomas Moorehead and Forensic Accounting</strong></p>
<p>Forensic Accounting, as I’m sure many know, is the practice of examining accounting records for evidence of wrong-doing, criminal or civil. <strong>I would be very very curious to know about the financial records connected with Moorehead’s development of his Buick dealership property in Omaha.</strong> From reading Nick Bryant’s book, it appears that the Franklin Credit Union was mostly in the business of extending relatively-small home and small business loans to low-income, predominately African-American members of the Omaha community who had difficulty obtaining such loans from other banks. </p>
<p><strong>I know this is speculation, but I feel like if Moorehead did have an account at Franklin, he might have still used a different larger, commercial bank to obtain the large commercial loan he presumably would have needed to finance the land purchase and physical construction of his Buick dealership in Omaha.</strong> Again, the Franklin Credit Union, at least in terms of its relatively-legitimate public activities, appeared to be mainly involved in small-scale lending. I think it is very reasonable to think that Moorehead would turn to a larger, more established bank (<strong>very possibly in Omaha itself</strong>??) for the actual large-scale loan he would need to really finance his dealership.</p>
<p>Again, I know this is a hunch, but if all this were to be true, that would mean at some point, Moorehead would have had to submit evidence to such a commercial bank, that he actually had the large financial savings he would have needed to get such a large loan in the first place. There is no way a commercial bank would ever extend a large loan to Moorehead, if he didn’t already have access to a large amount of financial savings to use as collateral to secure such a loan.</p>
<p><strong>Following this logic, again if this were to be true, if anyone found the loan documents for Moorehead’s first Buick dealership in Omaha, you very well might find actual documentation of Moorehead’s bank account at the Franklin Credit Union, if in fact he was keeping his money there.</strong> Moorehead would have had to submit evidence of him having an account at Franklin with substantial savings in it, to the commercial bank to obtain any large loan from them. This could very well be part of the loan documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Another thing that I am very curious about: what is the audit trail for Moorehead’s first dealership in Omaha?</strong> Is there any record of the dealership getting auditing in the years immediately after its opening, like in 1988 or ’89? If there are audit records for Moorehead’s dealership in the years immediately after the collapse of the Franklin Credit Union (which again occurred in 1988), the audit report would have to go into some detail about the financing of the dealership. If a different, larger commercial bank was involved in the initial financing of the dealership, evidence might be found in the audit report(s).</p>
<p>As I’m sure one can tell, if Moorehead really was using money embezzled from the Franklin Credit Union as collateral to secure a loan for his first auto dealership, any larger, more legitimate bank that extended Moorehead such a loan, would absolutely be a partner in a criminal conspiracy. <strong>Such a bank would be extending a very large business loan secured by stolen, embezzled money used as collateral for the loan. Such a thing is obviously no joke in terms of legal implications</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>And if a larger bank was really involved, one has to obviously wonder if the bank still exists today, in Omaha or elsewhere, or if it got merged or bought out by another bank.</strong> Which obviously makes one wonder if records, if they exist, could be still be &quot;hidden away in a filing cabinet,&quot; so to speak. Putting this all together, I have a gut feeling that if any real forensic accountants dug into all this, things could get pretty serious real quick.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions: Possibly paths forward, and connecting back to the CIA’s alleged “deep-cover agent network”</strong></p>
<p>One last thing I feel worth mentioning: as described earlier, the ultimate “black box” for all of this kind of financial research related to Franklin, has to be the actual “second set of books” Larry King was keeping at Franklin, in order to try to cover up his theft of millions of dollars from the bank. <strong>If Moorehead really is criminally involved with Larry King, you would no doubt find very real evidence of it in that second set of accounting books.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>As Nick Bryant wrote, it was both the National Credit Union Association (NCUA), and the FBI that raided the bank, and presumably had access to, and very well might still have, that second set of books.</strong> I feel like trying to get the accounting books from the FBI is about the ultimate exercise in futility, but the NCUA? I honestly don’t know anything about them other then that they are basically a business association for community credit unions, but I can’t imagine they are as hard-nosed as the FBI. </p>
<p>One final note: I do think, in its own way, this information backs up my two previous posts on Voat (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2712717">here</a> and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2712727">here</a>) about the possible CIA-sponsored network of protection that may be hiding Larry King “in plain sight,” so to speak. As Nick Bryant and others have written, if there is one thing the CIA loves, its powerful people who are seriously compromised, legally or ethically or both.  A powerful person who is seriously compromised is the perfect asset, someone who can be used the Agency for any number of different purposes that benefits the Agency. Being forced to hire Larry King could very well be one of those purposes. If Moorehead’s seed money that launched his business empire came out of the Franklin Credit Union embezzlement scheme in the first place, then he again is forever compromised, forever beholden to the powerful figures that lurk behind the overall Franklin Scandal. Very glad to get this information out there, stay safe everyone!!</p>',
