            I think it's extremely interesting that the second most powerful in the US all those years could have a history of raping boys and when it was exposed there wasn't an investigation into what sort of blackmail was being used against him while he was in power and how it determined how government operated during those years. Surely the blackmail value didn't increase
            <em>
             after
            </em>
            Hastert was out of power but I suspect people were handling it for him in return for legislation to their liking. It became obvious to me after reading the Podesta emails about their buddy Denny that high level Democrats instructed the msm not to dig into it and conservative media just wanted the story to go away for obvious reasons.

            Not what happened at all. I actually grew up in Oswego, the town that Hastert is from (i even went to the same high school that he went to lmao) and so when I was growing up living in that town - I definitely heard everything about what a creepy pedo Hastert is.
           </p>
           <p>
            It wasn't just a case of one person accusing him of being a pedo and him paying the person hush money. Before he was a politician, he was a teacher and wrestling coach at a high school in Yorkville (next town over basically) and during the years he worked at the high school - there wer numerous students who were sexually abused by him. The majority of them never came forward about it. The person who was getting the hush money was definitely 100% truthful in their claims and wasn't just "accusing him of pedophilia to get hush money". This whole Hastert case would be a MUCH bigger deal if all of the people who had been abused by him had actually come forward, but the majority chose not to for whatever various reasons.

            Wow. This is as brazen as Epstein and his lawyers. Someone should do a deep dive on Hastert and map out all his connections. Who hired him, donated to him, benefited from his actions in government, went on vacation with him. These wolves do seem to run in packs.

            - article on same, basically. Only with the added twist of Barry Welsh naming Pence as a pedo-enabler. Barry said, "Once again Mr. Pence shows poor judgment in supporting his friends in Congress instead of doing what is morally correct. Now Mr. Pence has positioned himself as a part of the cover-up and an enabler of child predators. That is not only unacceptable, that is shameful."

            Yes I heard about this in the news. Suffice it to say that Hastert ain't exactly a class act.

            Definitely not the kind of guy to invite to your home. Yet he rose up through the government.
