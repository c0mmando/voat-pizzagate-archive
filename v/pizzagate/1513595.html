<p>It presents numerous tips for avoiding the heavy censorship we are now under. I have more followers than before the <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1489779">#AskAlefantis campaign</a>, yet now have noticed that I am hardly getting any retweets and people are saying my Tweets are not showing up in their Feed.  My account may be all but redundant, and others are claiming the same.</p>
<p>This user proposes a novel two-account setup (or more).  The primary account makes the main tweet, conversation accounts help share it and inject into conversations and retweet on hijacked trends which may or may not have relevance. This way if conversation accounts get delete or suspended (as they are \'active\') then the resources remain online; all the people who have shared them still have the original source.</p>
<p>It also makes the compelling argument that the primary purpose now on an \'enemy platform\', that the Globalist Twitter and FB now are - is to drive traffic to the emerging social networks (primarily, [Gab.ai].  I have also hear people in Germany have abandoned FB in droves as censorship is so extreme people are having their employers contacted if they make even mildly critical comments about immigration or Islam.  The are turning to the Russian-based [VKontakt] and others.</p>
<p>We are primarily fighting an information war and the enemies main weapon is programs / algorithms to limit our message, and employing Far Left groups and trolling companies like CTR. We need to think of ourselves as any guerrilla, rebel force, fighting a significantly better-resourced and more technologically advanced enemy.  We need to become amorphous, employ cell-structures so we do not have any large target that (if taken out) would ruin us, or if infiltrated harm is limited because we operate in cell structures with resources based offline and safe harbours to regroup and redeploy.</p>
<p>If you are active on Twitter please share this info.  I would love to hear other peoples thoughts on circumventing Twitter censorship and effectively using social media more generally.</p>
<p>NB - even Voat has some censorship: i tried to give hyperlinks to VKontackte and Gab.ai but the post submission was rejected as \'banned domains\'. I think its VKontakte which is blocked.... why?!</p>',

            My twitter account hasn't been banned yet, and I have people picking up my posts. I don't have many followers at all, but people are finding the tweets by hashtag searching. A couple of them have started following me and they have thousands of followers and they re-tweet my posts. I suppose it's possible that they may have been shadow-banned but I'm checking on them from a second account and the tweets are there...All combined these people who are re-tweeting amount to hundreds of thousands of followers - I'm tweeting memes which seem to really be working out well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Honestly, I'm not sure why I haven't gotten banned yet. I'm not tweeting all hours of the day that's for sure, probably for short spans of a couple hours here and there so I might not have triggered anything yet. Sometimes I don't even tweet @ anyone, just load up the hash tags and part of my approach is using something that's popular or trending from:
           </p>
           <p>
            ht tps://www.hashtags.org/trending-on-twitter/
           </p>
           <p>
            Like I'll frequently include #news, #fakenews, #pizzagate, #rt and then throw in a top hashtag like #sex or #christmas.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             I'll often pair these with another screen shot of a news article with links to here and to the article if I have enough chars left.

             Are people allowed to share their twitter name on here? following each other and each other's followers/whoever each other are following could help boost those with fewer followers maybe? Also there is a diverse groups of people here, from all political spectra and walks of life, so following each other and each others followings would help penetrate the echo chamber perhaps.

            Also worth adding to this discussion - online security of data, and privacy / anonymity.  Any tips?

            I used the latter to set up an anonymous email address to send whistleblower proof about severe malpractice in my last post as a social worker. Because of the nature of what was sent i was under suspicion as the whistlelower but i denied it and there was no proof or link back to me.  In the same way if we share stuff like PizzaGate we should assume our info is getting stored somewhere and if we really do go down into a 1984-style rabbit hole, we don't want to be marked out as 'subversive' and have your internet access removed (as they do in China - if you are LUCKY).
