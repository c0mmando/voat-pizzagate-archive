<p>The pedos seem to like Tiberius\' villa on Capri built in 26 AD, where he retired to molest children and babies until he died in his late 70\'s.

Roman Abramovich...is said to have set his heart on buying a £21million cliff-top castle on Capri.&quot;

<p>&quot;The Romans called Capri goat island&quot; Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capri</a> 
When Tiberius was there, the Romans called it &quot;old goat island&quot; according to Suetonius. Permissive as they were, the Romans were repulsed by their emperor\'s pederasty and murderous paranoia to the point that they rejoiced at his death and called for him to be thrown in the Tiber River (an ignominious treatment reserved for criminals; it didn\'t happen though--he was cremated). </p>
<p>We have already seen and discussed email about children in pools for &quot;entertainment&quot;, the appalling art on the walls of Comet Ping Pong, and the art of MKUltra survivors. It echoes Tiberius\' perversion.</p>
<p>[Tiberius\'] &quot;lusts reached ever lower depths and he preyed on the children who lived in and around his court. Tacitus tells us \'new names for types of perversions were invented\', such was Tiberius\'s depravity. Tiberius hired slaves to find him children to satisfy his urges. These agents were entirely above the law and they kidnapped victims if parents or relations put up a fight. Some even violated the children before they reached their lustful master.

<p>Suetonius\' description reads like it\'\'s from the archives of pizzagate: &quot;He acquired a reputation for still grosser depravities that one can hardly bear to tell or be told, let alone believe. For example, he trained little boys (whom he termed tiddlers) to crawl between his thighs when he went swimming and tease him with their licks and nibbles; and unweaned babies he would put to his organ as though to the breast, being by both nature and age rather fond of this form of satisfaction.&quot; </p>

            this is the problem with the elites being above the law. they should not be above the law. they should answer to the law like the rest of the population. this is how paedophilia has become rampant among the elite.

            Romans were Tribe of Dan crypto Jews ("Aryans").  Thousands of years of interbreeding with their Judaic cousins yielded this depravity, no doubt.
           </p>
           <p>
            Almost as bad as Tiberius was his nephew, Caligula -- who had trained boys, whom he called his "minnows," nibble at his genitals as he swam.  (Actually, that's the most benign practice.)

             Caligula, or his praetorian Macro, is thought to have murdered Tiberius by suffocation or poison, depending on whom you believe.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oddly, Caligula started off well, and was beloved of his subjects, as chronicled by Suetonius who said he reformed the military and completed amazing infrastructure projects.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then Suetonius writes, "So much for Caligula as emperor; we must now tell of his career as a monster".

              Can we please petition to remove him. I'm not sure whether he's a shill or not but he constantly deletes good posts for petty reasons. It is frustrating to spend time preparing a post only to have it scrubbed by some idiot. We need all the help we can to try and unravel this plague, and it seems as though he (perhaps unwittingly) is hampering our progress.
