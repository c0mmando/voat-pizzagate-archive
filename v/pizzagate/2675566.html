            ⧫ J.C. Morris, an entrepreneur from Anchorage, Alaska, bought the island in 1946. He wanted to build 200 homes on the island but was thwarted by the high cost of installing sewer lines. Morris’ mansion, built in the 1960s, was designed in a style that borrowed from architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Marion Chenaur and her husband bought the mansion in 1990. She sold the property in 2015 to Nicole Pham and her husband Jim Porter, who were restaurateurs in Thurston County, Washington.

            Wasn't there a link to Alaska regarding the pilot of the plane?  Could there be a connection?

State University.

           <p>
            Just speculating.  This Morris guy that bought the Island came from Alaska so did the pilot.  Somehow did Russell make it to that island and something bad happened to him there?   May or may not be connected, but he said some really strange things when he was up in the air.

             “Ted Bundy had a mental illness. Osama bin Laden had a mental illness,” Gee added. “Osama bin Laden’s mom did an interview recently and said he was a good kid who got brainwashed … they talked about how good of a person he was and then got that way. We’ve been watching John Moffitt, former Seahawk who’s on social media right now with all that sexist stuff he’s saying. I know John Moffitt; he didn’t use to be that way. Something has snapped in him.”
