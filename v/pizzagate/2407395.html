<p>Her story highlights the brutal realities of human trafficking in Mexico and the United States, an underworld that has destroyed the lives of tens of thousands of Mexican girls like Karla. </p>
<p>Human trafficking has become a trade so lucrative and prevalent, that it knows no borders and links towns in central Mexico with cities like Atlanta and New York. </p>
<p>U.S. and Mexican officials both point to a town in central Mexico that for years has been a major source of human trafficking rings and a place where victims are taken before being eventually forced into prostitution. The town is called Tenancingo.</p>
<p>Karla says she was abused for as long as she can remember and felt rejected by her mother. &quot;I came from a dysfunctional family. I was sexually abused and mistreated from the age of 5 by a relative,\' she says.</p>
<p>When she was 12 she was targeted by a trafficker who lured her away using kind words and a fast car.</p>
<p>She says she was waiting for some friends near a subway station in Mexico City, when a little boy selling sweets came up to her, telling her somebody was sending her a piece of candy as a gift.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, Karla says, an older man was talking to her, telling her that he was a used car salesman.</p>
<p>The initial awkwardness disappeared as soon as the man started telling her that he was also abused as a boy. He was also very affectionate and quite a gentleman, she says.</p>
<p>They exchanged phone numbers and when he called a week later, Karla says she got excited. He asked her to go on a trip to nearby Puebla with him and dazzled her by showing up driving a bright red Firebird Trans Am.</p>
<p>When I saw the car I couldn\'t believe it. I was very impressed by such a big car. It was exciting for me. He asked me to get in the car to go places,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>it didn\'t take long for the man, who at 22 was 10 years older than Karla, to convince her to leave with him, especially after Karla\'s mother didn\'t open the door one night when she came home a little too late.</p>
<p>&quot;The following day I left with him. I lived with him for three months during which he treated me very well. He loved on me, he bought me clothes, gave me attention, bought me shoes, flowers, chocolates, everything was beautiful,&quot; Karla says.</p>
<p>Karla says her boyfriend would leave her by herself for a week in their apartment. His cousins would show up with new girls every week. When she finally mustered the courage to ask what business they were in, he told her the truth. &quot;They\'re pimps,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;A few days later he started telling me everything I had to do; the positions, how much I need to charge, the things I had to do with the client and for how long, how I was to treat them and how I had to talk to them so that they would give me more money,&quot; Karla says.</p>
<p>It was the beginning of four years of hell.</p>
<p>Karla Jacinto was lured from poverty in Mexico by a man who befriended her with sweets and a story She spent four years being forced to have sex 30 times a day She has told her story to the U.S. Congress to get changes in the law, and to the pope</p>

              pimps deliberately get their workers hooked to have more control over them but they can only sell their drugs to clients once a prostitute can be sold multiple times its about how much mileage you can get out of your product junkies are hooked but you have to keep getting more drugs to sell to them when it comes to child trafficking they just use them over and over again until they die

            This town is mentioned a lot. There are posters everywhere of missing people. Its a mystery that anyone stays there, because the law enforcement is so corrupt. Juarez and tijuana are bad too, but this town isnt a border town, making it a weird exception.

            I have been to Puebla many years ago.  Things have changed I am sure.  Everything has changed for the people in need, nothing for those that have it all or those that bring money as tourists.  My friend is down there now and 2 yrs. ago he said that parents were hiding their children under the floor boards to protect them.  Protect them from being stolen.  Stolen for Trafficking.  Those that bad mouth the ones that service the buyers, remember that these were children when they were taken.  Many stolen.  They had no choice. Like this girl.

              Yes, I do too.  Thee is a man going to run for Pres., now for the 3rd time.  When we were down there the first time he ran, the people in the town were having a huge protest because TPTB were trying to keep him from running.  He ran against Nieto last time and now he plans to run again.  I know someone that says he is a good man that is why they keep him out.  The PRI party is bad. There are people in both parties that are bad.  We are not much different.

                We have ruined so many countries.  We not only have to make America great again, we have to undo the hurt in those countries too.  It is our duty. We cannot continue to plunder all over the world and not expect it to come back to us.

                    Children.  People used to protect them more.  Now they think of them as little adults.  That is part of their normalizing, I fear.

                        I can understand that.  We all come from different backgrounds and families.  Mine was very structured.  But I was the odd one out.  I dared to question, but still I feel for the Kool Aid.  My parents were never my friends, but they are now.  Now that we are all adults.  And we all call each other for advice.  I talk to my Mom almost every day.  I run to the phone thinking it may be the last time.  She is 90.  I can't even imagine the day I will have to do without those calls.  My Dad, now that is another story. :)

                          I agree.  We are all here because there is something in us that connects.  I believe it is the Children.  No matter what our differences may be, that is our common denominator.

              Thee have been some comments added that are disgustingly disrespectful. What horrid language about women that have no other hope.  They talk about men but do not speak of them in nasty terms.  They do not understand nor have respect for women evidently  This makes me so sick.   They do not understand that the girl was 12 and was an attraction to these type of men.  They know the look of an abused girl.  It is their business.  She was a child now an abused woman.  I hope she has enough help and finds hope.

              Yeah. I would never pay for sex, it's way beneath my dignity. And ego.
             </p>
             <p>
              Every whore has fucked hundreds of men, and how many just before you fuck her? It's gross.

              I have a difficult time imagining that there are enough men to create the immense demand that there is for prostitution.

                 Your stated opinion is the whores are below contempt and not worth slave trade coinage. While true to the unwashed, the hatred behind the implication that whores are below fuck bags is a dead give away.
