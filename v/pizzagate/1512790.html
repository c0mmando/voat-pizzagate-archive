<p>UNICEF 1987 June around 14th
The scandal erupted last week, when the Belgian police arrested Jos Verbeek, 63 years old, the director of Unicef\'s Belgian committee, and charged him with inciting minors to debauchery. 
The arrest followed the discovery of a secret photographic studio in the basement of the Brussels building where the committee\'s offices are housed. The studio was used to take pornographic photographs of children, many of whom were of North African origin, the police said.

            The problem here being that CP is not something that we are going to sift through to get the actual evidence needed. There is an abundance of circumstantial evidence and at this point thats what we are limited to finding. I'm thinking that maybe we can find real evidence of organ trafficking or other crimes involving children to circumvent the CP problem.

             Agreed but my main focus is public awareness.  I know that many anonymous tips have been sent through the FBI website from pizzagaters but my area is posting memes on facebook, gab, twitter, etc.  I think without public outrage (think Belgium protests regarding Dutroux) the prosecutions may not happen.  At this point it still seems impossible to raise awareness.  People reject the idea even in the face of calmly presented, well organized facts.

              it is very frustrating. Its the same with the Wall Street frauds. I think it is to avoid a feeling of hopelessness. Nobody wants to identify as a victim. Also, look what happened to occupy wall street and standing rock, nobody wants to be violently suppressed. Public outrage and protests are a hard sell.
