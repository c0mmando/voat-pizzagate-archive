            Hi quantokitty,
I saw a post by another used about comet being registered as having two stories a couple of days ago. I did a little bit of googling, found out that a basement is classed as a storie. There are plenty of photos that show the skylights throughout comet, literally every room, so there is no second floor! From looking at google street view, the place next-door to comet, 5038, looks to have a second floor. I tried to get info on this building when I first looked into it, but couldn't find much without paying for the info. If you have a property shark account, the you can look up 5038 and check how many floors/stories it has, hopefully it will shed a little more light on the issue.
Hope this is helpful, and sorry if someone has already brought this to your attention.
Great research btw, keep it up!

             It's always good to get intelligent feedback. It keeps things honest and provides another way of looking at things.

             We want to be accurate. It doesn't help to spread disinformation.

            I would trust one, if done on camera, and an in the presence of independent witness or two. if I was trying to clear my name, I would insist on these conditions. The Mcanns could right now. so could the people accused of 911. So could the people accused of lying about wmds. the same with the people staging shootings. The same with Obama proving he is a legal president, or if his wife is a transexual, or if his children are borrowed for imaqe points. The same with every controversial case, ever.  What makes no sense, is leaving millions of people to wonder, and speculate. you would not want to leave even one mind in doubt, if you could.

            When it come to clearing a name, and the issue is about them being believed, a polygraph is a sensible idea. It is more accurate than prints, in my opinion, especially if combined with the services of a lie expert, who can spot body language. An innocent person, in a situation like this, would offer to take one. That he has not, adds up to mounntains. The only thing more significant, is that no parents have come forward yet, to defend any of the photoed children.

            There is something incredibly strange about this row of businesses all being related to one other either by ownership or connections to HRC (see the other thread that talks about the connections at length).
           </p>
           <p>
            The theory is that there is a tunnel in the basement that allows children to be moved sign unseen. Not a far reach given Alefantis's own comments online and the fact that DC has an extensive tunnel network. The tunnel could also be used to move drugs, money.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the very least, the basement is most likely the site of some sort of abuse of children, i.e. ritual abuse, satanic sacrifices.

            Yeah when that guy did the Periscope that was immediately what caught my eye. I was like "what the fuck is that shady curtained off area with flickering light inside?" It honestly looked like a little dank, stone room lit up by candles. In a kids pizza place? WTF?

            Hey, JA &amp; Co. have said some pretty disturbing things involving children. If it was just about adults getting together and engaging in sexual activities, I would be watching CSI and not caring, but kids? Come on! That email about Evie's Crib is frightening as is the MC at Comet joking about us all having our preferences. Yeah, we all have our preferences, but we all better make damn sure they're consensual!

(1) The "two story" description refers to the small stairway in the back leading to the children's party area, and James was using hyperbole in his past interview where in mentions a basement.

            I've stated this about 50 times now. Stair or raised or sunken rooms do not constitute a separate floor. In real estate, a separate floor must allow passage and livability underneath said floor. So you can't have three steps and say someone can live under the three steps. I believe the requirement is at least six feet. It would mean most people could comfortably walk beneath it. So again, steps up or down do not constitute a separate floor. They do not. You have to be able to live and walk under said floor for it to be considered and listed as another story.

            In terms of Bucks' and Comet's respective basements, I think Comet's is more suspect. Why? Because: (1) it's obviously hidden. My speculation and best guess extrapolated from the evidence is that the employees don't even know it's there; and (2) he's been so adamant about it being there. But to return to (1), it must have been designed to be hidden from the beginning which means that's where the major part of whatever goes on down there, goes down. Unless that storage unit (the #killroom) is in Bucks cellar, then I'd say Comet is the place to investigate. Now the other assumption could be that part of Bucks' basement is hidden. In other words, employees know about a basement, they use it for storage, but a section of it is hidden. That could very well be.

            It could be in the kitchen. It would make sense. It's very common to connect the basement to the kitchen -- especially in commercial sites. The kitchen is where you'd using the supplies you're storing. But again, why isn't this basement being used for storage? Curious.

            I am just using the barest logic here. if a photo of my child, or a relative, or even someone i knew, were being shown in that context, I would have cleared it up, that day. it is the most glaring absence I have ever seen, that no one has yet. the sensitivity argument does not fit, because it is fro that very reason, that they should be dispelling these concerns if they can. if he really were innocent, they would have come out right away, and said "your being ridiculous, my child is ok, and was just playing." No one has! Asking after them, is just plain sense. It shows also this is not about politics, but caring if children are ok. Those children would not have been in those photos, if they had parents who care about them. They would have immediately complained, and reported Alephantis, the moment a suggestive comment was made. Each one is missing as far as I am concerned, and that is a time to put personal feelings aside, and methodically find them. Any parent who has not said anything,about these photos, or concerns, is likely to be a person of interest at this stage. Think about it? Would you be ok with those photos? Would anyone? Only Alenfantis types would.

            You can also prove it on square footage it's 4.5k listed but measured from the air it's only half that. As an fyi for accuracy all buildings on that row are listed as two floor it's a realtor trick, if it had two floors it's listed as 3. There was a few posts on that yesterday with realtors contributing. Heres one

             As for the number of floors/stories, we needed proof that the realtors were doing it in this case, and they are.

             Now we can get down to serious speculation about why oh why the Comet basement isn't being used to store those canned tomatoes. What else could JA &amp; Co. be using it for? I'll bet any amount of money that even the Comet employees don't know it's there. It's top secret and the info is only given out on a need to know basis.

            In the transcript from that meeting. when he says Alefantis is making it a den of murder and rape, there were some boos and comments immediately following. It reminded me of the parliments in Australia and England, where you can hear them doing this, to comments they do not like being said. Sadly there are likely to be a number of pedophiles in these parliments. So it strikes me, as maybe what this man must have come up against, when he tried to stop it. Many of the people who got the place passed must have known.

            here is the site of Mcollough construction, who appear to have expertise in below ground work. I can imagine, if they are not involved, they might have innocently done some work for Alefantis, not realising what it was for. They might be willing to talk about it even! I notice they are an LCC company, which is the initials meaning Limited Liability Company, that are on some of Alefantis' business titles. Maybe they give each other financial advice? In have not heard of LCC's before this

             You know, in another thread I read about one of JA's relatives being involved in the renovation/construction business. I even made a joke at the time that he could do as much tunneling as he wanted because it would all remain secret. Not sure what I saw -- or where --- it was in the beginning of my involvement with #pizzagate. Thanks for the info and link. Oh, I also wanted to mention that in the three building permits JA has gotten, he's listed himself as the contractor.

              Excellent point, thank you. That whole place, has had so much work done on it. there are walls knocked out, etc. i can guess he would never have put a permit in, either, given his connections. The amount of work done, would indicate his hands on involvement. The photos where the tunnels are being dug, looks like one he took, as an overseer.

               Exactly. Where is the original construction/demo permit?
              </p>
              <p>
               Maybe that proves it was put under a different name? Maybe that alone will set off another round of investigation. If I can find what the original construction is under, maybe I can find where other permits were approved -- or not.

            Unless things are totally different on the east coast, that would not be classified as a separate level of the building as it does not require any extra structural overhead. I had a house that had 3 floors technically, two sets of stairs leading down 10 feet or so, one to a living area where the ceiling was around 18 feet, and another from there to a ground level floor area below the top floor, but since the 2nd floor didnt have a separate overhead ceiling , my house was classified as 2 story because of this even though we referred to it as upstairs/downstairs/basement.

             I think it is pretty significant. Now we can move on and try to figure out why the Comet basement isn't being used for storage and why JA has been lying about there being a basement.

            I've been trying to dig up some info on the previous restaurant THAI ROOM which opened in 1972. There was a book written by John DeFerrari called Historic Restaurants of Washington, D.C.: Capital Eats
I found this quote from the book but i cannot find the book anywhere to see what else it says and if there are any details about a basement:
The city”s first authentic Thai restaurant was the THAI ROOM, which opened in 1972 at 5037 Connecticut Avenue Northwest in upper Northwest. It began as a ...
I found this link for the book preview which is dead.
            <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?isbn=1626191263">
             https://books.google.ca/books?isbn=1626191263
            </a>
            Amazon has the book but cant preview the proper pages relating to Thai Room.
I really doubt if the book says anything about a basement but who knows!
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a facebook page for the book at
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HistoricRestaurantsOfWashingtonDC">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I really believe this is where our answer lies.... in finding out the details of the THAI ROOM which is now CPP is a historic site in this book. Somebody knows... maybe someone on that facebook page knows if Thai Room had a basement. If someone could find a copy of the book would be great to see what is says about Thai Room .

             I agree. I tried a 100 different times to find articles on The Thai Room. Maybe a personal account of the managing of the kitchen including where they stored their produce. But think about it. Comet Pizza has a liquor license. Where are they storing all that alcohol? If they're storing it at Bucks it makes no sense because they have a damn basement! In terms of the book, you can't do searches for certain words which is a bummer. So I don't know. It would be a good idea for someone to skim through it. Is it on Kindle? You can do word searches on Kindle.

            Both will be linked, and there will be tunnels. 
The construction company next door to Comet Pizza, Mcullough, specialises in tunnels and underground work.
I wonder if they would proudly tell us about the work they did there? If they did not know what it is for, then why not?

             Absolutely they'll be linked. I was convinced of this, but conviction isn't proof. Now that we know the two properties have basements, we can figure out how they got linked. It could be through Mcullough. As I stated somewhere else, JA has a relation that's in the construction business so it could all have been done on the QT. And if both properties were his, JA could have given a very innocent explanation as to why these two storage areas needed to be connected. Oh, and the other thing I wanted to mention is that these construction contracts are very often private and confidential so a construction company wouldn't even be able to legally say what they were hired to do.

              they say they do foundational work, and you can see many photos of them working below. Maybe specialised was too strong a word, but it  is in their repertoire.

              if I lived close enough, I would be checking out all the surrounding drains. I would especially want to check the manhole, out front of the Comet Pizza sign. When he walks across the floor, in the I have nothing to Hide interview it makes a hollow echo sound.

            I lived for many years in NW Washington DC.  In my experience, it would be unusual to find any building in the city without a basement of some sort.  The odds of there being a basement in CPP are very high.

            Great find! Someone actually posted a link about these san marzanos a week ago but i didnt get what i was supposed to be looking for. Seems like difinitive evidence and yea... if Bucks has a basement, i highly expect CPP has one as well, especially since the previous owner Thai Room opened in 1972 , that place is old, not like it's an addition or something. There is most likely a basement under the whole thing.... This is very close to catching him in a big lie!

            Nice, you found a basement. I found a guy with a tattoo "Pizza Time" on his stomach... with fliers placed in East Side Pies... playing in Austin right now.

Why not offer money to comet ping pong to allow a small group of people view the building? It is a business. It would return customers, clear rumors, - and gain money. If they don't, adds more suspicion. I suppose entry's ways and catabombs could be filled unless....unless we have people viewing the building constantly and the surrounding buildings somehow until the offer is made and declined or accepted. If suspicious amounts of activity occur after acceptance? Further suspicion. I see reasons why this might not be reasonable. Resources (money) and credibility is lost if it is all covered up to a level of detail required to fool experts

              Because I believe the basement is hidden ... I mean, really hidden. I doubt the employees know they have a basement underneath them even though they obviously and clearly do have one. Again, Comet has two stories. Think about it, Comet has a basement, and yet they don't use it for food storage? They store all the canned tomatoes that are going to be used at Comet at Bucks. Why? What are they using that basement storage area for? And remember, the basement of Comet's has to be huge. The one floor is 3925 feet so the basement is probably the same size. You can get a good idea from that walkthrough he gave the two nunchucks. If you saw the video, then you'll know how cleverly the bathrooms are hidden. You'd just think there was a wall there. You can imagine how hidden the basement is.

              by the same logic he would have offered a polygraph by now, if nothing to hide. this is a great idea, and need to be put to him. I would also like to know if the children in the photos he put up, can be accounted for. That could have cleared a lot up, and its a glaring absence it has not happened yet.

            Yes, but somehow he concludes they must be identical. Demanding professional, or at least a decent job, makes the kids angry.

            I think the excitement by OP and many others is that this would be a "possible" red herring lie by Alefantis. This is more a direct tie in that is another piece of the puzzle to prove he did lie by claiming there isn't a basement in CPP. IMO, the lie is what is important. Prove he lied about that and then you have evidence of some kind of cover up bc having a basement, alone, is no big deal. So why lie about it?

               I've gone through this I don't know how many times. Comet and Bucks only have one floor to the restaurant, but both have 2 stories listed in the real estate sites. Since the article confirms a basement, we know know that the second floor is referring to the basement. In other words, two levels, the basement and the restaurant space on the first floor. The same has to be true for Comet. It only has one floor and steps up or down are not floors. So confirming one, confirms the other. Both have basements.

            In this video, the presenter Titus said that Alefantis did unpermitted construction, specifically digging, and he cited the local building and safety records.  Can anyone back this up?

            21 MINUTES IN.  Photos from Jimmy Commet's instagram showing what could be another underground section of Ping Pong, possibly tunnels.  Is there anything here?  Or just smoke and mirrors?

             Holy crap! That video is so disturbing. I haven't heard about unpermitted construction. I wouldn't doubt it. JA only has gotten three building permits and none of them involved this type of construction, and he does have a relative in the construction business. Just as importantly, he's listed himself as The Contractor in the building permits he's gotten.

            I was wondering about the title remark ... yeah, no ... I don't do that. And it's not a simple question. It's why I said if you're not a shill to check out some of the other posts so you'll get the big picture.

            I think the importance is, that Alefantis recently claimed CPP had no basement, earlier he had said it had a basement and that discovery is an additional indication, that CPP probably has a basement and that Alefantis did not tell the truth.

            This is analogical evidence of a basement.  The basement he claims he doesnt have at Comet.  That means he's hiding something related to that basement for some reason.  Nobody can be this dumb tho you basement deniers are seriously on a mission with this

            It's called circumstantial evidence. That's what this whole case is. A lawyer would have to link all of these things together to tell a story.

             It proves Alefantis is lying, he has stated it on the news that there in NO BASEMENT. This could be the smoking gun. One lie exposed will lead to others. PLUS if he is actually lieing about it, means there is something really bad down there!

             A lawyer doesn't just give point A and point Z. They have to explain prove A, then B, then C ... etc., all the way to Z.

             So here's the basement everybody was speculating about. It's not speculation any longer.

             These shills are really serious about trying to deflect and divert from this basement thing.  Why would it be so important to prove THEY DONT have a basement?  To where multiple people on here are spending so much time trying to fight this basement theory?  Makes me think the basement is a touchy subject for some reason.  Why would that be?

               poor argument.. this isn't a wtichhunt (well actually in some ways it is, but not in the traditional terminology)
this is something worth noting. its circumstantial evidence. Stop shooting stuff down and also pretending to be someone your not Mr Semen.

             "They ignore basic truths," Alefantis tells BBC Trending. For instance, the conspiracy supposedly is run out of the restaurant's basement. "We don't even have a basement."

                You both are shills rewriting history and you're again missing the point.
               </p>
               <p>
                Look at the godd*mned real estate listings. I've included links for both properties. Both Comet and Bucks are listed as having TWO stories. TWO ... not one. While some speculated the two stories reflected a story that had been torn down, this validates that the levels were counted and a level includes a basement.
               </p>
               <p>
                So in proving Bucks has a basement, we prove that Comet has one also. Otherwise the number of stories would reflect the difference.

               Proves the first.   Doesn't prove the second.  It's evidence towards the second.

              <p>
               And the reason I say it doesn't prove the second is I was thinking there might be scenarios like the one mentioned just below.  I don't know how that would be represented on the real estate documents.

               Most likely bc that strip would have been built at the same time presumably and then divided into businesses. It would be very odd for a commercial real estate company to only require the build out of one basement in the stretch of real estate. Possible, but highly unlikely. What we need are original construction records. When were the buildings built? By who and are those records located at the tax assessors office maybe? Permits?

                Youre probably right... sitting in the filing cabinet of another corrupt burocrat.
The owners of Thai Room which opened in 1972 where CPP is now, of course they would know... but i bet they wouldnt talk and i wouldnt blame them.

                The other question may be, why store it at Buck's if you have a basement at comet and they are ingredients used for comet? Two possibilities, there's no basement at Comet or the basement is used for something else.

             And the point is that the real estate listing says:

             TWO FLOORS!!!
            </p>

             That means we can safely infer that Comet has a basement too since these listings are now proven accurate!

              Comet sort of has two floors, the back room is down some steps and walks out to the parking lot in back, which is a lower level.

               No. We've been through this before in my other threads. Steps up or down are not considered a story. You have to be able to walk and live UNDER the other story with at least six feet of clearance for it to be considered a separate story. A sunken room or raised platform is not a story -- not.

             Alefantis apparently knows, or is at least informed about, Marina Abramovic, a Thelemic witch. Some of his pics suggest he is involved in the occult as well. In Thelema, you are supposed to consume "cakes of light". Some sources say daily, but others say just at "mass". This does include a bit of blood, or semen, and special seasonings in a biscuit. The blood may be animal, but the most preferable blood is menstrual, and next best is that of a child. This practice has carried over into the O.T.O.. I see no reason why someone couldn't make a pizza with the same ingredients.

              Still, they have a good reason to be storing a large amount of red fluid, after a big sacrament for example.  That pedo art shows many children at a time tied up or held in a circle.   Feeding it to the public even in trace amounts might give the idea that their "magic" is penetrating society in a secret mass communion.  At this point, to deal with them and trace their crimes you have to be willing to think like them.  Ugh.  Ill now.  I really respect law abiding law enforcement for what they have to go through in their jobs.

               It would not surprise me in the slightest if their secret ingredient (The episode with Guy what's his face who does the food show also has James referencing a "secret ingredient" -- if memory serves it looked like red flakes) contained human flesh.   However if they were doing so in the past I very much doubt that a current pizza would contain human DNA.   Too much heat.    He's probably fed all the remaining evidence to the pigs on his farm.

               or they serve Southern Italian food.  Geez is my grandma suspicious now for canning tomato sauce?
              </p>
              <p>
               The article makes clear that he does not buy canned San Marzano tomatoes throughout the year.  This are a readily available commercial product.  He is buying a giant amount of local tomatoes at harvest time in the late summer.  So you have process a years worth of tomatoes at that point.
              </p>
              <p>
               The significant point is one of his restaurants definitely has a basement.  Not that a pizzeria uses a lot of tomatoes.

               If this is new to you go to YouTube and search for "Podesta spirit cooking" - it's one of the major reasons PizzaGate started; so creepy people gave the much less obvious pizza and pasta references more credence. Spirit cooking broke people's cognitive dissonance enough that they would give a second look to the emerging PizzaGate speculation at that time.

               It's true. Buckle up your seatbelt it's only going to get worse as we find out more. "They" are all part of the OTO. They eat shit as well. Now does it make sense why all those flies keep landing on Obama and Hillary? I mean besides the fact that they are demon possessed.

            and so if anyone sees red stains, it's tomatoes.
Luminol is used to detect blood where you don't see it with the naked eye. It was used to reveal bloodstains in Mexican pyramid tunnels and sacrificial rooms over 500 years old. Sure be interesting to examine the basement rooms and tunnel system. just to be thorough.

             Bloodstains on floor of the killroom. Clear as day. No one has mentioned them yet. It has similar concrete to the dc tunnels, and other floors seen in photos, at comet pizza..

              I did mention that on some reddit thread about 3 weeks or a month ago, but it's been deleted since. I did state that there seems to be blood stains in that killroom and that IMHO, if it were sprayed with Luminol, it would all light up like a christmas tree.

               I am glad someone else noticed. It has the hue of blood. And does not look just like a restaurant fridge to me. I could not see it was a fridge at all. if it is a fridge, I would expect that he would have shown that straight away, and said "look, its not a kill room, its just a fridge." each matter, that he has not raised an innocent explantaion for by now, heavily indicates it must not be innocent.

            Wow, last year he bought 12 tons of tomatoes? I wonder how much that translates into in terms of cans? Found this:  1 cup canned tomatoes = 1-1/2 cups fresh, chopped, cooked tomatoes. I'm thinking that has to be a huge basement!

             By using their calcs, and they say that this is for thin sauce, 12 tons is like 4800 liters. Liter and Quart are very close in volume so lets say they make it a bit thicker for pizza and its like 4000 quart jars worth. So if they used all 4000 in a year it would about 10 quarts a day.

              Why would they store them at bucks? And there lies the million dollar question. Because a) there is no basement at CPP or B) the basement is being used for something far more sinister than tomatos!
We can't discount those pics of them breaking up concrete creating what looks like tunnels. This would be something next to impossible to hide, so he would have to lie!

               Why not make the basement at bucks the dirty deed place then? They wouldn't be hauling 12 tons of sauce over to their other business every year. It is very illogical to me personally. How do you explain the need for it to be at CPP?

              OK so lets say they do store them on a pallet to entertain the other commenter.

              They ship them 720 jars to a pallet so 4000 jars would be like 5 pallets worth. If put back into the boxes and stacked the same height, which I doubt they are doing.

             15 LBS of GRAPES makes one liter of wine, U people obviously know little of about  how this stuff works. 
I would speculate that 200 LBS of raw tomatoes can make a 80LB bucket of tomatoe sauce. Which would be around 5 gallons.
            </p>
            <p>
             Remember grapes, tomatoes, and humans are 95% water.

            </p>
            <p>
             Do the math, what is it a few dozen pallets and those were the weight of fresh tomatoes, they have stew them before canning, which probably dropped the weight to 5 tons, which would be ten pallets, stacked it would just take a few sq-yards,
            </p>
            <p>
             My bet is 5 gallon food grade sealed buckets, about 100LB each, that would be 50 buckets, could be piled to the ceiling again, just a few sq-yards.

              Extracting liquid from grapes is not the same. They're CANNING tomatoes. This is the formula:  1 cup canned tomatoes = 1-1/2 cups fresh, chopped, cooked tomatoes. So for each 1 cup can you need 1 1/2 cups of fresh, chopped tomatoes.

                True enough. It's approximately 15 pounds of tomatoes for 8 pint jars of sauce. That's a phenomenally large amount to stock.

               <p>
                Re: the canned tomatoes, I was remembering the first quote from the other article he gave. It led me to believe he was canning the tomatoes.

               5The formula is how many LB of fresh tomatoes does it take to make "Ketchup" ... It's a Weight to Volume problem,
              </p>
              <p>
               15 Lbs of Grapes make a liter of wine
10LBS of tomatoes makes a 4 litres of tomatoe juice, you cook ( reduce ) it to one litre.
              </p>
              <p>
               A large can of whole tomatoes if you reduce it to make pizza-sauce you get about 1 cup of sauce, so its about 4 to 1 reduction.
              </p>
              <p>
               ...
              </p>
              <p>
               But what does this to do with pizzagate not a fucking thing, MY POINT is that 12 tons fresh tomatoes would take up very little space reduced as ketchup, the reason you reduce is you can always add back water.
I dry tomatoes, it takes 50 kg of raw tomatoes to make 1kg of dried tomatoes, often for canning we make tomatoe paste, it takes 50 LB of tomatoes to make a bucket of tomatoes paste
              </p>
              <p>
               ...
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm sure James Alefantis has his tomatoes reduced to paste, that way you just add back in water and onions and garlic and olive oil as needed make sauce,
              </p>
              <p>
               12 TONS of fresh tomatoes produces 480 buckets of tomato sauce,  500 litres, is about 20 - 5 gallon ( 19 liter ) buckets. This is NOT a big operation.
              </p>
              <p>
               ...
              </p>
              <p>
               Why do people do anything to avoid Besta-Pizza, or Podesta, or KLINE? ... Why only chat about Jimmy Comet?

             Its a strip mall and CPP was originally the Thai Room which opened in 1972... so this place is very old, the only way it is possible to NOT have a basement is if it was an addition to the strip mall. Given the fact the place is at least 44 years old one would assume it was part of the original construction, in which case the basement would run under all the stores in the strip.

             I'm sure he will, but it's a moot point. The real point is we proved there's a basement!

            </p>
            <p>
             Might we infer that Comet has a basement, too?!!!

              CPP also is listed as having 2 floors. I read the property listings a couple weeks ago.

               Exactly!

              <p>

                I originally was playing devils advocate and thinking maybe they have an up stairs, but after seeing the interior of the place, the ceilings are too high to have an upstairs.
