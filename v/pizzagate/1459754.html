            Also, I've noticed all day today, that a search on TOR browser for voat/pizzagate brings up on top a different post, one from a while ago, about possible DDOS of voat, then a bunch of other non-related links.

              I hadn't seen that one before.  It reminds me again of why some of the big promising topics on here, I really do think should be taken off the main board here; all the findings are here for the world to see, and gives them a heads up.  Just like some people comment on these sickos' IG pages. :(

               I agree, I have stated before to all but a few deaf ears that people should team up to research and use some kind of voice communication , we can't kid ourselves  we are being watched by both NSA and those pedos.
