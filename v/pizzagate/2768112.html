            Once late at night on 8Ch in late 2016, a poster said the Kill room had been melted and all evidence gone.  Anyone recalll the We The Pizza hackers?  Someone posted seeing the menu and a few horrific videos.  Half of them were in a metal industrial room he said.  This stuff is real.  It was covered up.

             As I recall, the We The Pizza hack as presented on Reddit, was generally thought to be a LARP after much discussion. The "Pizza Menu" that was posted there was later shared on Twitter by questionable characters who said it had been hacked from Comet, which diverted attention from a more credible account of  a hack of Comet, which didn't receive much attention at the time. The hacker in that case was later interviewed by Titus Frost.

             There is probably someone out there who saved all that information at the time and still has it.

            One bathroom at CPP had a hidden door until they remodeled it.  Did anyone ever figure that out?  I’ve been away from PG a while.

            Of all the things not to flag as old news...  This investigation has expanded and spread all around the world, encompassing so much, and yet we keep getting dragged back to CPP and Pegasus AGAIN and again and again.
           </p>
           <p>
            What does this achieve, besides to keep public discourse focused on the single link in the chain they've had YEARS to fortify by now.

            , the link you provided only goes to a Reddit post with almost nothing on it. Please edit this to add the hooktube link to the actual video so we don't have to give any traffic to that shithole. Also, we need a brief summary of the contents of the video. Best would be a full research thread with the titles and links to the original posts on this topic by
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/IsThisGameofThrones">
             @IsThisGameofThrones

            . You should be able to find those in his submission history, or via a keyword search at SearchVoat.co on "Pegasus". Giving this the 24 Hour Grace flair per Rule 2, so you can edit. Thanks!

             His user name on reddit is Guy who Alefantis threatened    Here it is Game of Thrones  At least that is how I remember it. If that is the Same Guy.  We should ask him to do it here.  No one has asked any questions on that reddit post.

                Idk anything about a kill room. It was a lane used by alefantis and company. For me it was a reference to three photos that we didn’t know the location of. We without a doubt found the location of those photos. Killroom ks their culture, not mine. Idk what they mean by that.

                 I'm a little late to this discussion, but the only thing that confused me about your videos was how you made the connection between the room that looks like a walk-in refrigerator that was called a "kill room" by werkinonmahnightcheese (not sure if I spelled that correctly) and the room with the brick walls and the channels being dug in the concrete floor. It's obvious that the second one is in the Pegasus museum, as you proved very clearly in your video, but how is it known that the walk-in refrigerator room (the Kill Room) is at the same place?

                  At the time i lumped those three photos together and i shouldn’t have. We without a doubt located the room in 2 of the 3 photos. All three photos were posted within weeks of each other. At this point there is no reason to believe that the walk in cooler is at Pegasus Museum other than it was in the same timeframe which is very flimsy. In fact i seriously doubt the cooler photo was taken at Pegasus Museum.

                   Thanks very much for the reply - that question had actually been on my mind for a year and a half. I remember reading somewhere, I think in one of the MSM articles, that Alefantis said that the walk in cooler was at another location (that is, not at Comet) but didn't specify where, or if it was at a property he owned. I wonder where it actually is?

                   I remember seeing a video in the early days of Pizzagate which showed Alefantis being questioned on the street outside Comet by a couple of guys who had enlarged prints of his Instagram posts. They had the Kill Room picture, and when they confronted him with it he kind of grimaced and turned away, and walked up the street without saying anything. When he came back the subject was changed and he never addressed the Kill Room question, though he did calmly answer questions about the girl with the tape and other things. This is the only time I can think of where Alefantis looked nervous or uncomfortable when being publicly questioned about Pizzagate. Segments of this video still exist, but the part where he responds to the Kill Room picture seems to have been scrubbed from YouTube, and I haven't seen it since 2016.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   For instance, in this video
                   <a href="https://hooktube.com/watch?v=gKTiUaloDDA">
                    https://hooktube.com/watch?v=gKTiUaloDDA
                   </a>
                   at 2.38, it sounds like they're just about to ask him about the Kill Room but the video cuts to another segment before the question is finished.

                 The conclusion at 1:17 that you found the killroom is completely unsupported.
                </p>
                <p>
                 All you found was a place where a guy made a table shares the same brick pattern as a place where some guys dug and hole and thus it might be the same location.  That's a reasonable, but not ironclad bit of speculation, but then you make a giant leap and say it's a killroom.   What the hell is that based on?

                   It's a perfect example of the cultural disconnect at the heart of pizzagate.  It's clearly a joke and doesn't exist and Pizzagaters not only take it literally, they've been trying to will it into existence ever since.

                    Ironically, we agree on this. It's like the search for the non-existent basement at Comet Pizza (which was always next door) or the search for the supposed tunnels. They're citizen investigators, they're not professionals, and they are easily distracted by non-essential points.

                    But of course, it's not nearly so interesting that ITGOT called it a killroom, as that

                      Yeah, I figured you would say that. You have yet to believe anyone who witnesses a crime by the Clinton cartel, or who is the victim of a crime by them. Bigfish was lying, ITGOT was lying, and so on. There's no reason to believe him ... other than his screenshots of actual menacing texts with Jimmy Comet, plus the fact that phone records are easily checked and it's a crime to make a false complaint, plus his Facebook connection to Jimmy, plus the fact that Jimmy does actually have some sort of ownership interest in the Pegasus Museum (I'm not clear on exactly what). Plus it has been more than a year now and ITGOT is still vigorously pressing his complaint. Apart from all that, though, his story is
                      <strong>
                       completely
                      </strong>
                      bogus.

                    You aren’t representing what your real problem is. But for others that might be reading this. It’s a comment from werkingonmahnightcheese on the photos i mentioned earlier.

                     My real problem is you are claiming as fact what is actually wild speculation.  And then people are building your speculation with more speculation and generate new "facts."   People who do actual investigations learn very quickly to be very clear about what they actually know as fact and what they think they know.

                     Did you hear about the Golden State Killer?  Biggest crime spree in US history.  Over 100 burgalaries, 50 rapes and about a dozen murders were all committed by the same guy in many locations in California.  He was caught earlier this year. Folks on the Internet for years were trying to find this guy and one of them began a crime writer and wrote a book about the search and her obsession with him.  She said every cop she talked to were absolutely convinced they had a suspect who was a dead match for the only for it to be unfounded. And they spent a lot of time chasing down a false path. It happens over and over and over again.

                     They have starting training police in some of the common things that cause misinterpretation of evidence.  These include, faulty assumptions, tunnel vision also called investigation lock, groupthink, and other cognitive biases like confirmation bias and hindsight bias.  Internet based investigation fall into these traps all the time.  So when they found the Golden State killer, they found him through DNA another family member uploaded to a DNA database.  The real killer's name never appeared in their files at all.

                     Back to your video none of the photos in the videos is the photo with the killroom comment......which to me reads as an obvious joke.

                     That photo was about a commercial walk in freezer.  Something nobody had shown to be at Pegasus.

               It's great to see you still active! I hope you get the chance to do an AMA. I'll just make an observation here about which direction I think the story should take.

               After 28 months of citizen investigation, it is clear that the strongest case we can make is
               <strong>
                against the cover-up
               </strong>
               . You've done great work in this regard, because while the Pegasus museum itself is interesting, Jimmy Comet's attempts to shut you up are positively
               <em>
                fascinating
               </em>
               . You really did them major damage by standing up to his threats.
              </p>
              <p>
               I originally talked about this
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2038598">
                way back in August of last year
               </a>
               . What I said then obviously got under Jimmy's skin in similar if milder fashion to your project, because he felt compelled to come on Voat and try to steer me in a different direction,
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2215476">
                as I explained in November

              <p>
               The key point is that these guys have been relatively complacent and undisciplined, and when confronted by someone who knows their tricks, they are not particularly skilled. They have relied much too heavily on the corrupt DC cops and protection from above. We can goad them into making more mistakes, and by demonstrating their vulnerability, we encourage others to come forward.

               The result of two years of relentless pressure is that now, real victims are starting to turn up that can tie the Clintons directly to child sex trafficking. This at least is

                what I think happened with Jenny Moore
               </a>
               . There were three different people who spoke with the young man who was raped by Bill Clinton.
               <a href="https://truepundit.com/listen-haunting-final-interview-surfaces-of-dead-journalist-jen-moore-her-chilling-details-of-abuse-of-alleged-clinton-rape-victim/">
                There is video of the interview
               </a>
               . And Jenny's death was hugely suspicious. They were in a very nasty bind, since they couldn't let her go ahead and pester ICE and Homeland Security with her charges, but killing her would also draw attention to the story. All of that is a huge new problem for them.

               ), if you haven't already. But even more important than that is that we all keep picking away at the cover-up. It is the weakest point in their position.

                 The citizen investigation (or a major part of it) started
                 <a href="http://turnitoffnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/FBIAnon-AMA-transcript-1-7.pdf">
                  when FBI Anon carried out his first AMA on /pol/ on July 2nd 2016
                 </a>
                 , saying that he was involved in the Clinton email investigation. He said that if the full truth about the Clinton Foundation came out, it would bring down the government.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Then later in July, the DNC emails were leaked and Seth Rich was killed. Killing whistleblowers is a pretty clear indication of a cover-up.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I have already explained how the cover-up REALLY started back in June 2013, with the Glenn Beck whistleblower incident, and you have already dismissed that argument without (you say) even bothering to read it. So for simplicity, we'll call this the "latest" cover-up or the "current phase" of the cover-up. Strictly speaking, it has only been 27 months since Seth Rich was killed, not 28, but one can also date the start from the June 27 meeting between Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch on the airport tarmac. That was pretty clearly cover-up activity as well.

The real point of interest is the Clinton Foundation, not the e-mail server. We received the
server from Benghazi, then from the server we found data on the CF. Then we realized the
situation is much worse than previously thought.

                  We know that the highest classified emails were a 22 email thread where CIA and State folks talked very vaguely about the CIA drone program because they knew they were not on the secure system.  The CIA drone program is a top secret/special access program and even though it's not a secret and routinely openly talked about any reference to it, even in a private email is TS/SAP.  The emails didn't mention CIA or drones or any names or details because the officials were talking on their "low side" nonsecure emails so they put no real information in them.   That's it that's the most dangerous thing on her computer.

                   It's not all that mysterious. If you substitute the somewhat clearer phrase "because of" for the word "from," it's obvious what FBI Anon is talking about. When the State Department was asked to turn over Clinton's emails relating to Benghazi, they only turned over eight of them. Then it eventually transpired that she was operating a private server, and after several years of delay, she turned over 33,000 emails from that while wiping the rest. From those emails it became apparent that she was engaging in "pay for play" and other corrupt practices relating to the CF. (Well, again technically there was other evidence apart from the emails that helped to establish that point, such as her engagements calendar which showed that the majority of her time that wasn't spent on other government employees was spent on CF donors. But the emails were essential to that finding as well.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   You can play dumb about the meaning of the word "from" and you can express astonishment about the "pay for play" allegations, but these are utterly uncontroversial points. They wouldn't normally merit being called a conspiracy theory, and they stand up quite well regardless of what anyone thinks about Pizzagate. There is, after all, an active FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation right now.

                    She has SAP level programs on her server, which if made public, would literally cause an uprising and possibly foreign declarations of war.

                   Well, yes and no. You've gone over the email chains in many previous threads, and I won't debate the technical issue of how they were classified because (a) you've largely gotten that right, and (b) it's irrelevant.

                   FBI Anon's response to Question 1-007 is particularly unrevealing and unhelpful, which I imagine is why you focused on that one. Here's another one where FBI Anon made a claim that I have never been able to verify:

                    All I can tell you about the SAPs is HRC had them, and she did not have proper authority to have any of them. They were leaked to her by someone, and she did sell them to overseas donors. Possessing them alone makes her guilty of treason.

                   As I said, I don't know how FBI Anon knew this, or even if it was true. He very clearly threw in some misinformation and misdirection just to protect himself. I wouldn't waste any time defending the view he expresses of Jews and the Holocaust, for example. When he is asked if he "named the Jew" and he replies "The nose knows," he's almost certainly just fucking with /pol/. Likewise when he tells us that "life exists elsewhere in the galaxy" or "deporting all blacks would be a great thing". But in dozens of his responses, he states his main point very clearly:

                    I will put it to you this way. You have three choices: 
A) Turn over all of the information to the DOJ, make public a recommendation, the truth comes out, the entire world realizes how much the US is meddling in foreign affairs and we go to war. The civilian population realizes how much foreign money influences out government, and a civil war begins. 
B) You cherry-pick the data to implicate the people already in the eye of public opinion, so the chips fall on the heads of a select few and the whole system does not crash. 
C) You do nothing and watch the unstable political climate to gauge how you will respond. 
I am confident if Trump wins she will be going to jail.

                   Here's the main thing that FBI Anon did not say in that first session: That the biggest "nightmare" he was trying to alert us to was child sex trafficking and the CF's involvement in it. He waited until his second AMA to delve into that, for example Question 2-079.

                    Sex rings are popular in all governments, but pedophilia is primarily in British parliament &amp; Saudi Arabia, and that’s why HRC and BC love foreign donors so much. They get paid in children as well as money. Dig deep and you can find it. It will sicken you.

                   So my broad reply to your nit-picking is that the current cover-up was of the Clinton Foundation's corruption and in particular its child sex trafficking, and that it started when Bill met Loretta on the tarmac.

                   Heh. You probably already realized this, because while you're something of a one-trick pony, you're not stupid. But you're not getting my best case. We've been well past that point for months now. You'll see my best case when it's part of an indictment, or when Glenn Greenwald explains it to everyone on

                    What is true is that emails considered SAP were on her server and how did FBI Anon know this?  It was known for months before he commented. It was known since January 2016.  Here's a story from February discussing the fact it was about the drone program, this is before the details of these emails were released and the fact they were vague, had no details, no names.  FBI Anon is trying to exploit this unknown by filling it in with bullshit speculation.  The emails are SAP simply because the drone program is SAP.  Had the emails been actually dangerous, this would have blown up and gone beyond Hillary.  The senders of the emails would have been guilty of crimes.

                    The issue with Clinton with regard to classified info HAS ALWAYS common "spillage" which is pretty wipespread throughout the government.  Spillage is when classified info gets into nonsecure systems.  It never involved classified documents, she would view classified into in HARD COPY after it was taken off SIPRNET, (the "high-side" secure system).  This involved references in non-secure emails to classied info or programs on "low-side" non secure email accounts.   That is, the issue originated on emails SENT TO Clinton.  You can't send an email from SIPRNET to clintonemail.com because SIPRNET is not connected to the regular internet.   The private server is non issue in this case.  The folks writing the emails were using their non secure state.gov or cia.gov or nsc.gov email accounts.  The issue would be the same if she used a state.gov account.  When receiving emails from non secure accounts, there's no expectation that you are dealing with classified material like there would be on SIPRNET.  This is why classified documents are always obviously marked.

                I completely agree. They are vulnerable for the first time in their existence. They over extended themselves with the censorship/coverup. This was only a temporary fix and I’m not sure they realize that.

                 Glad you agree. As for whether they understand how bad the situation really is ... well, sort of. They understand that the changes Trump is making at FBI and DOJ are gradually becoming irreversible. Even if they were to win back the House (unlikely), they wouldn't be able to impeach him. Even if they won back the Senate too, and impeached him, they'd only get Pence instead. I think Pence is rightly pissed at
                 <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2217878">
                  being called a pedophile and the worst serial killer in American history
                 </a>
                 , and among the many things that the FBI and DOJ will do (under Pence or Trump), they will hunt down the people who did that -- "Tory Smith" and Alexandra Meadors.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So there is no escape, and the footsoldiers understand that individually. They're probably stoned or drunk a good deal of the time, even more than before. But I think staff meetings at the child-sex-trafficking cartel are probably still characterized by a lot of phony good cheer. There's always some scheme to rest your hopes on. Even when Hitler's bunker was being shelled and Berlin was surrounded, he still drew arrows on maps like it meant something. I'm sure John Podesta and David Brock are scribbling madly on a whiteboard somewhere.

               Thanks. Just saw your post. I thought your video was brilliant. The instagram pictures fit the inside layout of Pegasus. Using your brick wall matching technique, I placed the infamous Instagram floor hole (with two workers staring in it) as being under those weird floating stairs. What do you think?  Also, here are a few comments on the same Instagram pic:
              </p>
              <p>
               "room11dc  Can we do a pop-up in there?"  (referring to the hole dug next to the brick wall)
              </p>
              <p>
               "Jimmycomet  Please this hole needs a popup! Line up now.
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/room11dc">
                @room11dc
               </a>
               "
              </p>
              <p>
               Sounds like double meaning. A pop-up can be a temporary restaurant. Room 11 DC is a restaurant located at 3234 11th St NW
Washington, DC 20010  A STRAIGHT LINE DOWN FROM PEGASUS.

               </a>
               A tunnel could have a "pop-up" or an exit.  At one time there were restaurants in the old subway tunnels at Du Pont Underground. Do you think I am on to something?

                Why is a hole in a floor infamous?   It seems like you folks are making up and believing your own stories about what is going on here, rather having the facts lead the investigation.

                A restaurant asking about doing a popup seems to have a double meaning?   Based on what?

                "Starting Saturday at 11 p.m., L’Enfant Cafe is launching La Boum Boum Room, an even bawdier, nighttime production that includes burlesque, go go dancers, acrobatics, dancing led by a live DJ and raunchy interactive games. The three-hour engagement takes place in the dining room of L’Enfant Cafe, which will be cleared of all the tables, chairs and stools. Oh, and there will also be a trapeze swing.
               </p>
               <p>
                “I deconstructed and rebuilt every element that people love about La Boum brunch: the organic-ness of a crowd, the sexual part of it, the flirtiness,” says Lynch. “People will enter what feels like a dream, and the later you stay the deeper you will fall into the rabbit hole.”  "Guests enter through a secretive side door and admittance costs $10.
