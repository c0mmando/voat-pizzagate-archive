<p>&quot;CLOSE TO 1,000 TRAFFICKING VICTIMS HAVE BEEN RETURNED 
TO ANDHRA PRADESH FOR REHABILITATION, MOSTLY FROM DELHI, 
MUMBAI, GOA AND PUNE. ANOTHER 400 VICTIMS ARE EXPECTED TO BE 
REPATRIATED. BETWEEN APRIL/JUNE 2003, 74 GIRLS WERE RESCUED 
FROM DELHI AND GOA BROTHELS AND BROUGHT BACK TO THE 
HYDERABAD NGO PRAJWALA, WHICH WORKS WITH A NETWORK OF RURAL 
NGOS TO COORDINATE REHABILITATION PLANS. THE STATE 
GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED RS. 1,500 ($33.33) TO EACH OF THE 62 
GIRLS. THE GOVERNMENT ALSO SUPPORTS THE INTERNATIONAL 
ORGANIZATION FOR MIGRATION/AMUL DAIRY COOPERATIVE\'S 4 PIZZA 
PARLORS, WHERE 21 TRAFFICKED VICTIMS ARE EMPLOYED AT RS. 
3,000 PER MONTH.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pizza parlors&quot; used as rehab for trafficked girls? Hmmm...</p>

            "Fuego del Sol (FdS), in collaboration with the World Food Program (WFP), Haiti National Office, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Haiti Communitere (HC), will receive $100,000 in funding from the Clinton Foundation to produce fuel briquettes for eco-stoves that the WFP places in area schools. The project will provide 20 jobs to the most vulnerable and earthquake affected citizens of Haiti, selected by the IOM. The Foundation’s grant will enable the project to triple its production of briquettes, and to undertake price setting and efficiency tests for their production process."
           </p>
           <p>
            So IOM is involved in picking who gets the jobs for this CF-backed "Fuego del Sol". Hmm.

            This "about" page seems to include a success story about someone using a sun oven. And of course...
           </p>
           <p>
            "One of the favorite local staple dishes in the DR is a type of fried chicken. Olga and her team at the Grupo Jaragua Community Center in Ovieado, DR developed a new method of roasting chicken in the solar oven that results in juicy chicken with a crispy skin almost identical to fried chicken, but a healthier alternative.  Most who eat it think it is fried, but this solar method uses much less oil than frying, deliciously cooking the chicken in its own juices. Cooking innovations like Olga’s Sun Oven Roasted Chicken are the key to continued use by members of this and neighboring communities."
           </p>
           <p>
            Probably literal chicken, of course, but interesting.
