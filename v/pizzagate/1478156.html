<p>Well, he didn\'t marry her, but the connection to the Holloway case is interesting, but not as much as this entry from his Wikipedia page:
&quot;In 1989, he formed the Advanced Product Group, one of three companies that merged to become Access Graphics. He became President and Chief Executive Officer of Access Graphics, a computer services company and a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin. In 1996, Access Graphics grossed over $1 billion, and he was named &quot;Entrepreneur of the Year&quot; by the Boulder Chamber of Commerce. Immediately following the murder of his daughter he was &quot;temporarily replaced so the company did not have to bother him about business matters as he grieved&quot;, according to Lockheed Martin spokesman Evan McCollum.Ramsey soon left his job to move his family to Michigan, where he joined another computer company. Access Graphics was later sold to General Electric in 1997.&quot;</p>
<p>Patsy Ramsey, the mother that looked like she was going to spill the beans any minute, died in 2006 of a very sudden case of &quot;ovarian cancer&quot;, before John hooked up with Holloway. They can always throw Patsy to the wolves, since she is already dead, and was perhaps an abuse victim herself.</p>
<p>The police have his daughter\'s murder case still open twenty years later:

            I think it will come out eventually that the Ramseys and the Holloways both belong to the same satanic cult.

            Hello - I really want to believe that Mr Ramsey had something to do with JonBenet's death but Im more convinced by the recent hypothesis of Burke/Kitchen/Flashlight. 
That said, I always thought it odd he already had ONE dead daughter under his belt before JonBenet...I wonder what secrets she took to the grave?

             Yes, Mr. Ramsey is suspect to say the least. I do not think entering his daughter in "beauty pageants" dressed like a prostitute is normal for someone in his position. He does not have the excuse that he is "trailer trash" doing it for the prize money--he's rich and influential. Maybe it was to cover up the abuse or his involvement in a Satanic pedo ring, as hinted at in the coroner's report.

               Thanks for explaining that. 
Well, I guess you can't please everyone. The summary is in the title.
The last time I posted a short summary, I was accused of not giving enough supporting information! Darned if you do, darned if you don't. 
I'm just putting it out there, and hopefully someone will connect the dots.

                 Oh, okay, thank you. I will do that in future. I do not know how to edit what is already there, even to correct spelling mistakes.
