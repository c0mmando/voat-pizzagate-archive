<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkivoAtIX8s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkivoAtIX8s</a></p>
<p>Full disclaimer: I was kind of on the fence about David Seaman in the past (I considered him a drama queen), but after thinking about the bigger picture, I think he is right in the grand scheme of things and deserves our support.</p>
<p>So what is the bigger picture?</p>
<p>Basically there are two groups of people in Western society:</p>
<p>The first group is the taxpayers/workers/common people: Mostly down to earth people, who do honest jobs and are deeply connected to reality - their livelihoods depend on it. That group basically gets their money by trading on the free market, i.e. by honest means.
The problem of that group is that they are disconnected and not very well organized.</p>
<p>The second group is the politicians/government employees/government contractors/welfare recipients/tax consumers: That group gets their money from the state, which means they get their money from the federal reserve system (the state would be bankrupt decades ago without the FED). Even though the federal reserve system it is not that difficult to understand, when explained in clear terms, it is cloaked in a net of economic jargon and layers of indirection, which means that most people don\'t understand it. Unlike tax payers, tax consumers normally don\'t really know where their money comes from, except that they have to defend the system to keep it flowing. Because of that, they share a common &quot;vision&quot; (defend and grow the state) are very well organized.</p>
<p>Because large corporations are to a large extent dependent on government contracts they are part of the second group. Corporate media is raking in huge amounts of money during the elections (all candidates combined have probably spent about a billion dollars on ads) and is also dependent on large corporations for ad revenue.</p>
<p>So how does Pizzagate fit into that?</p>
<p>The HoneyBee remarked that most if not all pedophiles are working for the government:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb1zJHweIto&amp;t=51s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb1zJHweIto&amp;t=51s</a></p>
<p>When we look at other countries (Jimmy Saville, Marc Dutroux) it is confirmed that pedophiles are intimately connected to the government. In Pizzagate, most suspects (The Podestas, Alefantis, David Brock, the Clintons) are getting their money directly or indirectly from the government.
BTW, I have heard that Comet Ping Pong does not deliver, which further corroborates that food is not their real business.</p>
<p>The question is, why are pedophiles attracted to the government?</p>
<p>In my opinion, the parasitic nature of government officials just fits into the predatory nature of pedophiles. Also, the whole psychological environment is more geared to them: When you work in the free market, you are forced to face reality from time to time - ideas have to be abandoned, you have to abide by the ideas of your customers instead of your own, etc. This mechanism does not exist in government. Instead the only thing that counts is the perception of reality. In fact the belief that perception is forming reality is quite widespread, for example teaches Keynesianism that economics is driven by self-fullfilling prophecies, in other words you only have to create the perception that the economy is fine, then everybody will invest and the economy will be fine. A pedophile will of course be attracted to this anything-goes-as-long-as-you-believe-in-it mindset.</p>
<p>The thing that probably shocked me the most about Pizzagate is how far the tax consumers are willing to go to defend the pedophiles. It simply does not matter how much evidence you show them, they will flat out refuse to believe it. The more entangled they are in the government mindset, the more they see anybody who threatens their worldview as an enemy. They simply don\'t care about reality, they don\'t want to know the truth. (A pretty good illustration are the dozens of videos on Youtube about anti-Trump protesters who are unable to articulate why they are protesting.)</p>
<p>So the whole Pizzagate thing is much larger, much deeper ingrained and much harder to combat than I (and I assume most of us) have ever expected.</p>
<p>Basically we are not just fighting a group of pedophiles that must be less than 0.1% of the population, we are in opposition to an alliance of many groups that all see the state as a vehicle to unlimited progress and bliss, and view us as roadblocks to that progress. They don\'t really care about what the pedophiles do, as long as the pedophiles are pro big government, they see them as allies and part of the forces of &quot;progress&quot;.</p>
<p>They already rationalized away Hillary\'s corruption (basically they say &quot;everybody does it, so it\'s a non-issue&quot;), they can do the same with pedophilia. In fact the first articles about how it is not a crime have already appeared on progressive websites, which I see as a way to prepare a second line of defense, should the pedophiles in government be exposed.</p>
<p>So what can we do to win the fight?</p>
<p>1) Support our people</p>
<p>As soon as anybody from the Pizzagate community gains some public traction, dozens of people are starting to attack him. This happened not just to David Seaman, but also to Ryan from Pizzagategear and Ryan from Random Rants of Ryan.</p>
<p>These attacks have an effect: Ryan from Pizzagategear has stopped selling T-shirts (although I have heard he restarted doing so a few weeks ago) and stopped doing research.</p>
<p>And it also had an effect on me, because for a time I myself was unsure about Seaman and Ryan. Then I looked into their backgrounds:</p>
<p>Seaman wrote about Hillary\'s health at exactly the time it would hurt her campaign the most (i.e. BEFORE the election). No way I believe a shill would do that.
Ryan proved that the heavy construction from Alefantis\' instagram was happening at Pegasus museum. No way I believe a shill would do that.</p>
<p>We should support the people who stick their head out and bear the brunt of enemy attacks.</p>
<p>Most people (including myself) don\'t have the guts to use their real name when talking about Pizzagate. But the least we can do is to support those who do and not stab them in the back.</p>
<p>2) Earning money is not a crime</p>
<p>The attackers usually use the old communist argument to smear the truthers by claiming that &quot;they only do it for the money&quot; and the fact that they earn money invalidates everything they say.</p>
<p>Of course if we follow that argument, we arrive at the basic authoritarian communist state where all private gains are immoral and only money received from the state is legit and acceptable.</p>
<p>The reason why this works is of course because it plays on envy.</p>
<p>Of course envy is a destructive emotion that will destroy any movement because it discredits it\'s leaders.</p>
<p>We should not allow envy to destroy our movement.</p>
<p>Also we should not let us be driven by emotions in general.</p>
<p>Let\'s assume that David Seaman really rakes in the money because of Pizzagate and becomes filthy rich. Would that be a good or a bad thing for the Pizzagate community?</p>
<p>It would be a very good thing because then others would join in and also talk about Pizzagate in an effort to emulate him or maybe even do it better.</p>
<p>The harsh reality is that most of us have financial commitments, family, a job, etc. and we cannot just work full-time on Pizzagate. So doing that would mean an enormeous pay-cut for almost everybody. If Seaman demonstrates that it is realistic to get at least some income by covering Pizzagate, then that will enable other people to do likewise.</p>
<p>Also we have to factor in the risks involved: Defusing a bomb is deserving of higher pay than fixing a watch, even though fixing the watch may require more skill to do. People who talk openly about Pizzagate are not just risking their Youtube channel and their Twitter account but also their lives. Dozens of people were murdered around the Clintons and there are also a couple of people who have been murdered because they investigated human trafficking.</p>
<p>I am not willing to risk my life for even a decent income from Patreon, but I am very thankful for those that do and they deserve all of it fully.</p>
<p>The only thing we have to keep in mind is where the money is coming from: If some NGO is footing the bill, the whole thing would be suspect of course, but as long as it is Patreon or some affiliate program or Youtube ads I have no problems.</p>',

            Thanks for letting us know another of your accounts. If you spent as much time on researching, promoting, consolidating or being the new public face of PG as you do annoying tf out of everyone, I reckon you'd do pretty well.

            What a brilliant post. We've got literally one shill in the comments, yet 5 people down voted this, meaning like all Seaman posts, this will never make it to the front page.

            You keep insisting it is disinformation when it's clearly a rumor, wihout any supernatural or other unbelievable elements.
           </p>
           <p>
            You never explain anything because you are unable to explain it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Putting out buzzwords does not cut it. The Alefantis rape allegation does not hurt the Pizzagate investigation - and you cannot explain how it could. You also cannot explain how the WorldCorp video would hurt it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe you don't want to discuss things but would rather just stir things up a bit and spread division?

            Why don't you use your real name and open a YouTube channel to spread awareness?

            Don't want to do it? Why not?

            I think that everybody who use spreading Pizzagate in public (that means using his real name) is great. Unfortunately there are not very many of those.

            I have gone through the pizzagate shills link and what I found were complete non-issues like the Alefantis rape victim.

            Yes that is just a rumor (but believable IMO), but it's not disinfo that can be used to discredit anybody.
           </p>

            Either you can explain in a few sentences how he is hurting the investigation or you can't. No more links to endless lists of BS.

             I personally believe DS is more of a useful idiot than a disinformation agent. The main defence of DS is that he's getting the word out. I agree that 3 months ago he played an important role in that. Since then his sub numbers have not grown substantially. So the majority of people who see his vids are already aware of pizzagate, and those interested have likely moved to other sources for pertinent information.  The ones who might only get pizzagate news from him, not only get outdated misinfo, theyre likely talking about his drama anyway. Though its impossible th say for sure it could be argued that his dramatized antics, and lack of reporting anything of substance, is turning more people new to pizzagate away than he's drawing in. An easily testable example of this is ask any normie what they think of Alex Jones. Most if not all will say: "you mean that crazy conspiracy theorist, hes batshit". This is basically DS on a much smaller scale. Just my opinion, I could be wrong.

              Recently he attacked David Brock which is a good thing IMO.
             </p>
             <p>
              Especially the tax evasion, which came out months ago, but has been forgotten by the pizzagate community until now.
             </p>
             <p>
              So that is a good thing. Otherwise, you may be correct, he may have peaked.

            Personally I don't care about what he's interested in or selling. That he's publicising PG is what I care about. What I feel more strange about is most of your comment history concentrated on the subject of  "David Seamans a shillllllllllllllll !!! !!!!!! He sells gold!!!!! He wrote a book on buzz!!!!!!!"  Plueease. Suggest you go on twitter and YouTube and become the public face of PG, as you seem to be so concerned about disinformation. See you there.

            Excellent post, thank you. I'd like to see some of the hate presently directed at DS, aimed at Brock instead. I get downvoated when I say this, but this is divide and rule. Who else is out there with their real name, with so many followers, publicising PG? Davids the largest public face, and it makes complete sense that tptb will attempt to assassinate his character. Don't fall for it, I say. Regardless of his style, he is on our side. Fight the other side, not inside.

           <p>
            3) Do not fall for disinformation
           </p>
           <p>
            The most common form of disinformation is to label something as disinformation which is not. That is also the mainstream media's narrative, BTW. They say that Pizzagate is merely disinformation put out by trolls and profit-hungry Youtubers.
           </p>
           <p>
            The most common function of shills is to call other people in the community shills to destroy cohesion and create frustration within the community.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please keep in mind that the above is by far the most common tactic used, it is easy to do and it works often enough.
           </p>
           <p>
            But of course there is also the art to put out laughable theories to discredit the community by association:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             The JFK community was (successfully IMO) discredited by associating it with the "moon hoax".
            </li>
            <li>
             9/11 was discredited by Judy Woods who was paraded around the media peddling her "energy weapons" hypothesis
            </li>
            <li>
             I have never heard of "flat earth" before Pizzagate. It popped up out of nowhere at lots of places about a month after Pizzagate broke, which could be the embrionic stages of that kind of disinfo.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            However one has to keep in mind that this tactic is only useful when there is a discussion in the public about Pizzagate. In other words the media would hype people who say they believe both in Pizzagate and Flat Earth. This is obviously not what is currently happening. In fact the Flat Earth thing seems to have died down lately, so IMO they have given up on Flat Earth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Detractors here on voat will usually link to this thread to "prove" that Seaman is a disinfo agent
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagateshills/1584235">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagateshills/1584235
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem with that theory is that it does not make any sense whatsoever:
           </p>
           <p>
            The "disinfo" is about somebody who claimed to be raped by James Alefantis in his pizzaria. There is nothing "outrageous" about that that would discredit Pizzagate. No laws of physics are violated. On the contrary it is something that quite literally happens every day.
           </p>
           <p>
            So this is a rumor, but certainly not disinformation. Even if it turns out to be wrong (which is not proven in any way, despite what is said in that voat thread) it would not "discredit" anybody here for merely reporting it. AFAIK David Seaman has only made one single video about it anyway.
           </p>
           <p>
            4) Yes, gold and bitcoin help
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the reasons why Pizzagate is even possible is that the state has quasi-unlimited funds via fractional reserve banking.
George Soros, who funds Comet Ping Pong, Epstein and many others are directly profiting from that system and many others indirectly. The whole system depends on stealth and deception which breeds corruption in general.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, fractional reserve banking is related to Pizzagate on a meta-level: Fractional reserve banking combined with ever rising government debt is basically using the next generation (i.e. the children) as collateral for a loan. It would be criminal if I would do that to my children, but when the state does it, it is just fine.
           </p>
           <p>
            So essentially, children today are born in a system of debt-slavery. To keep up that system, you need not only the legal trickery, but also the psychological brainwashing to make the slaves accept their fate. This is what satanists also try to do with children: Create slaves.
           </p>
           <p>
            By now (and also because of Pizzagate) I am fully convinced that "modern art" is merely a tool for money laundering. I never understood modern art, now I do!
           </p>
           <p>
            If we can get rid of fractional reserve banking, it would limit government in such a way that would be good for everybody.
           </p>

           <p>
            Summary: We must support our people and not stab them in the back. It is important that somebody talks about Pizzagate
            <em>
             in
            </em>
            <em>
             public
            </em>
            , that means using their real name.

             I agree. Everyone has a role to play and there's no reason why these roles can't be fulfilled in positive manners.

            <p>
             And just wondering... What if it turns out we don't make any substantial progress in the next few weeks? I'm thinking that shadow elite move even further into the shadows and infiltrating them will be even more difficult. Then it turns into movie Blade? Gotta go vampire hunting lol

tldr; Mike Adams the Health Ranger and webmaster of many health, Trump, and general news sites bribed then threatened to badmouth Alex Jones or he'll be destroyed. Timing coincides with attacks on Milo and David Seaman. Coordinated effort.
