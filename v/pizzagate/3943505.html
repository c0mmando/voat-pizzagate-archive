<blockquote>
<p>Count Erik Wilhelm Wachtmeister (born 1955)[1] is a Swedish Internet entrepreneur. He is the CEO and founder of the social media websites ASmallWorld and Best of All Worlds. In 2012, he was ranked #31 on GQ magazine\'s annual list of the 100 most influential men in Britain.</p>
<p>..Wachtmeister spent 16 years as an investment banker, working in London, New York and Los Angeles for Lehman Brothers, Rothschild and Ladenburg Thalmann.[4][5] He started his own business in 1993, raising private money for publicly listed companies.[9] In 2000, he became the founding CEO of UK-based investment firm Viking Internet, which he later took public on the London Stock Exchange</p>
<p>..On May 22, 2006, the Weinstein Company announced its investment in A Small World, joining a team of investors that included former AOL Time Warner COO Robert W. Pittman, film director Renny Harlin, and entrepreneur Alexander Von Furstenberg.[12][16][17] At the time, A Small World had approximately 130,000 members. Harvey Weinstein said his company planned to expand the site\'s membership and bring in additional advertisers. It was the Weinstein Company\'s first investment in an Internet property.[17] After launching online advertising in 2006, the website had 100 partners. Advertisers included Jaguar, Diane von Furstenberg, Mercedes-Benz, Cartier, and Moet &amp; Chandon.</p>
<p>.By April 2009, membership was in excess of 500,000.[5][13] Due to differing visions about the company\'s future direction and exclusivity, Wachtmeister resigned as chairman in 2009; he left the board in 2010.[12][18][19] Weinstein sold his stake in the company in 2009</p>

             Okay, so on the eve of my 21st birthday, I met
             <strong>
              Count Erik Wachtmeister
             </strong>
             . The world may know him as the dashing Swedish playboy who started A Small World, the private Facebook equivalent for the “jet setting, wealthy, well-traveled and well-heeled few.” I know him as “my roommate.” Erik rented a big house in Bel Air, California and invited me, a snobby girl named Julia, and the actress
             <strong>
              Elizabeth Hurley
             </strong>
             to rent the house with him. All we ever did was entertain. God, if those walls could talk!

             <strong>
              Erik was the ringleader and the girls and I were the hostesses with the mostesses
             </strong>
             . We had a dinner party nearly every weekend. These were no normal cocktail parties or dinner parties. Before A Small World debuted, our house was the small world. Celebrities, musicians, royalty,  notorious playboys, models, actors and actresses, socialites, philanthropists, nobility, an heiress or two, various bon vivants, business tycoons, and more than one infamous “character”…you name it, they were at our house. Believe it or not, we did everything on our own for these parties. We had a housekeeper but that was it. Erik, obviously, organized the guest list and took care of the entertainment. The girls and I did all of the decorating, setting the table, shopping and cooking. We had a great kitchen that was the hub of the house so I liked to be there. I would search through cookbook after cookbook to find interesting hors d’oeuvres. You cannot just serve Nicholas Berggruen a lil' smokie on a toothpick, for God’s sake. We had standards…or did we? Let me explain…
            </p>
            <p>
             Elizabeth Hurley is one of the chicest, loveliest, most beautiful, elegant, sophisticated, well-dressed, polished, cosmopolitan fancy pants women on earth. There is no attesting that. However, the girl cannot cook. This is the funny part of my story. So on this particular day, we were preparing for a dinner party, looking forward to entertaining Prince and Princess So-And-So. I was preparing the actual dinner so I asked Elizabeth if she could take care of the hors d’oeuvres. “Absolutely, darling,” she replied. Great, I thought, a few things off of my plate and I could focus on the dinner. Elizabeth left for about five hours and finally returned with the “hors d’oeuvres.” Wait for it… She walked into the kitchen with five grocery store bags filled with… Swear to God, Puffy Cheetos! Elizabeth Hurley! Puffy Cheetos!

             In March 2004, the web portal "A Small World" was founded, which
            </p>
            <p>
             became a gathering place for rich people and celebrities around the
            </p>
            <p>
             world. Behind the page are Erik Wachtmeister, born in 1955, and
            </p>
            <p>
             his wife Louise, born in 1978. The age difference of 23 years is obviously
            </p>
            <p>
             not a problem. The couple has two children; a son and a daughter.
            </p>
            <p>
             Erik has lived a bit here and was in the world, including New York City,
            </p>
            <p>
             Los Angeles, London and Paris, but has now settled in
            </p>
            <p>
             Stockholm and lives in a cozy apartment by Stureparken on

             Östermalm in Stockholm.
            </p>
            <p>
             A Small World did not generate large sums until after a few
            </p>
            <p>
             years when it was decided to invest in having advertising on the site
            </p>
            <p>
             , which gave financial success. Erik's new project "Best of All
            </p>
            <p>
             Worlds "is a similar project, but has not yet been a
            </p>
            <p>
             major success.
            </p>
            <p>
             Erik was previously married to a woman of Polish origin named

             Monika (they were married between 1998 and 2001). Together with

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The extreme worldview of white supremacists and crackpot conspiracy theorists has now become the underlying ideology supporting the rapid, shocking rise of Donald Trump, a man who seems to have a severe case of narcissistic personality disorder, lacking the slightest ability to control his own impulses. His chief strategist, Steve Bannon, a former Goldman Sachs banker, was the malevolent genius behind the meteoric rise of Breitbart, an extremist news site known for publishing incendiary fake news.
            </p>
            <p>
             The extremists learned how to exploit the fissures in people’s world views and psychologies. I would say the result is equivalent to a kind of mass hypnotism or mind control. We know from the past that this is the peril — the shadow side — of new media technologies. For instance, Fascist leaders in the 1930s were able to reach into the mass psychology of the population through radio transmissions. Radio was the new media of that time, and using it to repeat hateful messages had a hypnotizing quality, similar to the repetition of memes like #pizzagate or #lockherup on the Internet now. Amazingly, Bannon copied, almost word for word, rhetoric used by Hitler in some of Trump’s campaign speeches.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once-marginal figures like the radio host Alex Jones became essential to the extreme right’s march to power. Jones said in videos that Hillary Clinton “personally murdered and chopped up and raped children.” He argued that members of the New World Order elite are not even human — that they are alien lizard people. In Breitbart and Alex Jones’s Infowars, we find a deep undercurrent of racism, misogyny, and anti-Semitism — like the currents that led to the Nazi Holocaust and other genocidal programs of the distant and recent past.

              The Langham continued throughout the 20th century to be a favoured spot with members of the royal family, such as Diana, Princess of Wales, and many high-profile politicians including Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle.[3] Other guests included Noël Coward, Wallis Simpson, Don Bradman, Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia and Ayumi Hamasaki.

             <p>
              The Langham was hard hit by the Great Depression and the owners attempted to sell the site to the BBC, but Broadcasting House was built across Portland Place instead. During World War II, the hotel was used in part by the Army until it was damaged by bombs and forced to close. After the war, it was occupied by the BBC as ancillary accommodation to Broadcasting House, and the corporation purchased it outright in 1965....One BBC employee who stayed at the Langham was Guy Burgess, one of the 'Cambridge Five', a spying ring that supplied official secrets to the Soviets during the Cold War.

              Portland Place is a street in the Marylebone district of central London. Named for the Third Duke of Portland, the unusually wide street is home to the BBC Broadcasting House, Chinese and Polish embassies, and the Royal Institute of British Architects.
             </p>
             <p>
              Many of the houses are now occupied by company headquarters, professional bodies, embassies and charities (including Arthritis Research UK and the Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund). The landmark headquarters of the Royal Institute of British Architects sits at 66 Portland Place directly opposite the Chinese embassy..Other foreign diplomatic institutions include the Polish Embassy, a Portuguese consulate, the High Commission of Kenya, the Swedish Ambassador's Residence and the Colombian Consulate... Number 1 houses the Institution of Chemical Engineers, number 41 the Academy of Medical Sciences, number 23 houses the Nursing and Midwifery Council, number 67 the Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund and number 76 the Institute of Physics.

              In Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman's Good Omens, the angel Aziraphale learned to dance the gavotte in a "discreet gentleman's club" in Portland Place, becoming the first and only angel who dances (on the head of a pin or otherwise).

              Lawyers have called for an overhaul of the honours forfeiture system after it emerged that a sex abuser retained an honour bestowed for services to the Queen some three years after a court recognised him as a paedophile.....Hubert Chesshyre, 78, an expert on heraldry and genealogy, held a number of senior positions within the royal household, rising to become secretary of the most noble order of the garter, the highest order in British chivalry... A fellow or member of several illustrious organisations and charities, he was a heraldic consultant to the likes of Sir Paul McCartney, Lord Sugar and Sir Terry Pratchett.

                 During his daily Coronavirus press briefing on Sunday, Governor Andrew Cuomo took the opportunity to extend plaudits to Northwell Health system of hospitals throughout the New York area and its president and CEO Michael Dowling.

                <p>
                 As a leading network comprised of world renowned hospitals, Northwell has received well deserved accolades from the nation’s premiere health institutions, prominent physicians and distinguished medical associations throughout the country. Honored on countless occasions for its unwavering commitment to preserving lives at all costs, to providing the gold standard in health care and conducting seminal pharmaceutical research for cures to diseases, Northwell Health has earned not only a stellar reputation in the health industry but has taken leading roles in other crises and is shaping the future of health care in this country and around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Governor Cuomo said on Sunday: “I want to thank our host very much, Northwell. Michael Dowling, to my left, is head of Northwell. They’ve done an extraordinary job all through this situation. They have an extraordinary leader in Michael Dowling. Michael Dowling ran health care for the State of New York, health services for the State of New York. He worked with my father. Came for one year, wound up staying with my father for 12 years in State service. He’s one of the really beautiful and brilliant leaders in this State. It’s a pleasure to be with him. I want to say to all the people of Northwell who have done extraordinary jobs, thank you so, so much. Thank you for having us today.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 Michael Dowling is one of health care’s most influential voices, taking a stand on societal issues such as gun violence and immigration that many health system CEOs shy away from. As Northwell Health’s CEO, he leads a clinical, academic and research enterprise with a workforce of more than
                 <strong>
                  72,000 and annual revenue of $13.5 billion.
                 </strong>
                 Northwell is the
                 <strong>
                  largest health care provider and private employer in New York State
                 </strong>
                 , caring for more than two million people annually through a vast network of nearly 800 outpatient facilities, including 220 primary care practices, 52 urgent care centers, home care, rehabilitation and end-of-life programs, and 23 hospitals.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Northwell also pursues pioneering research at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research and a visionary approach to medical education highlighted by the Zucker School of Medicine, the Hofstra Northwell School of Graduate Nursing and Physician Assistant Studies, and one of the nation’s largest medical residency and fellowship programs.

              sorry if youve seen this, but I didn't want this company to get lost in the research.

              Did you see Waris and Heller involved in this Blood Lab? Neither of them have ANY background that would make them authorities on a medical endeavor, so why? Unless we are right about any of our suspicions.

            No surprise Alex Von Furstenberg is neck deep in this shit. All that grown man child does is kite surf, travel, bed models and pretend to understand business. He just had his fourth kid. Eldest daughter Talita is a stuck up little brat who is inheriting her grandmother Diane Von Furstenberg clothing business. Funny thing is Talita Von Furstenberg posted on her social media that everyone who follows her needs to enable change by voting when the Floyd situation happened and people asked her how voting was going to make a difference in police brutality and racism but she couldn’t quite figure that out. Someone else posted an epic response that her own Von Furstenberg family FUNDED THE NAZI PARTY during the Holocaust. Amazingly, within ten hours or so of that response with others chiming in, the Wikipedia’s for all Von Furstenberg family were CHANGED AND MODIFIED!!! They had not been touched for almost one year prior. Then Talita deleted that string of responses. WHAT DO THE VON FURSTENBERG FAMILY HAVE TO HIDE ABOUT FUNDING THE NAZI PARTY. Diane Von Furstenberg married Prince Egon Von Furstenberg and she was Jewish so I guess Egons mom and pop didn’t mind even though they 100% funded the Nazi party in World War 2.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alexander Von Furstenberg also has a hand in the Tavistock and Child Mind Institute and delete a link to the latter when mentioned on here. It is also well known he is a sex addict, womanizer who loves young models.

              “I won the Ovarian Lottery”

              Talita is probably THE most self entitled spoiled brat out there with Olympia a hair behind her. Yes, I read the whole I won the ovarian lottery bullshit. Really? Alexander Von Furstenberg and Alexandra Miller’s genetics are nothing to brag about. Even if one were to go back through the family trees with the Agnelli and and VF’s it’s still nothing to brag about. They were and are to this day nothing but Kabbalah witches and Luciferian baby eaters and child sacrificers posing as nobility hierarchy. It is 100% truth that the Von Furstenberg family ie the wonder doting great grandmother Clara Von Furstenberg (Agnelli) and husband funded the Nazi party. These two later took in Diane and her gay husband Egons two kids Alexander and Tatianna and they lived and were brought up with them until age 6 when they were then shipped off to boarding school. Diane did fuckall to raise her kids. A lot of people loathe these fraudsters a great deal. The Daily Mail did a recent article about Talita vacationing with her aristocratic boyfriend in Italy and the comment section is golden, so much so that they had to turn off the comments.

            They had an event at a notorious smut performance venue called THE BOX in NYC. This isn't just some innocent burlesque show as they advertise on ASW, but a well known host of some of the the most vile 'performance art' in the world. THE BOX - "We can provide entertainment specifically tailored for your event."

             Remember the year he made over 450,000,000£ in his investments alone during a bad year. He and his family were sailing the part of Greece in their mega yacht right when those apocalyptic “fires” happened. They watched and left, sailed away into the evening not helping anyone stranded in the water. They also have a donation charity for natural disasters but never donated anything. He is a very sick man, his wife Marie Chantal also. During his 50th bday and his daughter Olympia’s 21st bday they had a multi million dollar combined bash and called it the 21/50 Revolution. Yeah, really. Marie Chantal wore an ugly pink dress with Revolutionary written in black across it. Ultra tacky couple. Marie Chantal sports her ridiculous giant eye necklaces whenever she goes. Pavlos wears the pinkie ring. MC dabbles in and out of Kabbalah, same with her other lame sisters. They have five spoiled brat kids the eldest two or three who do absolutely nothing but party and travel, occasionally attend classes.

               NO. No. Just noooooo. WHO TF DOES THAT?!?!?!? Beyond tacky. Oh yes hi, this is Olympia of Greece calling to book my booth...... what a dumb twat. She always looks shitfaced or stoned with her open mouth breather photos with a touch of Down’s syndrome. Her mom is just as bad, have u seen her “book of manners” lmfaoooo. It’s like she was writing it for her own kids without saying as such because they do absolutely fuck all but leech money from their non existent titles and Luciferian blood lines. They are all just revolting.

                It’s very true, according to my 100% reliable source. I hope all the journalists and stalkers who always come over to this board pick up this story and run it the tabloids :)

                The kids are such uninteresting dum dums. The moms must’ve had a hey day and a half back in the 90s. I live for British gossip! Apparently they all lived in Upperclass London, ate, danced and did coke at all the right places and hung out with London society trash like Prince Charles goddaughter Tara Something Long and Posh, who “mysteriously died.” These mysterious deaths are getting a little boring. Tara and Pimp Mama Caroline must have hung out. So many recent (in the last ten years) deaths in that 90s fashion/music/socialite circles. Jizzlane was buddies with them all. Who was that model, Jodie Extra Super Skinny who was like a Kate Moss rival. She was caught dealing drugs to undercover journalists. Doesn’t her family have a Bahamian Island also? Is there anyone

             <p>
              ..Not long ago, this elegant former prostitute was a global celebrity, a putative warrior against sex trafficking in her native Cambodia. She was feted by New York Times human rights columnist Nicholas Kristof and by A-list celebrities like Oprah Winfrey, Queen Sofia of Spain and actress Susan Sarandon.
             </p>
             <p>
              ..Now, in his first interview since the Newsweek article, Mam’s ex-husband Pierre Legros speaks with GlobalPost about the controversy and the alleged fabrications.
             </p>
             <p>
              Legros co-founded with Mam and another colleague the anti-trafficking organization AFESIP (a French acronym for Agir pour les Femmes en Situation Précaire, loosely translated as Acting for Women in Distressing Situations). He left the organization in 2004, as his marriage was falling apart, and following a controversy after AFESIP and the police raided one of Phnom Penh’s most high-profile hotels.
             </p>
             <p>
              In Southeast Asia since the late 1980s, Legros first worked as a laboratory manager with Médecins Sans Frontières in UN refugee camps. In 1990, he was a technical adviser in Phnom Penh for the National Malaria Center (CNM). A year after he arrived in the city, he met Mam at Samaky, a popular beer garden. She was one of 30 prostitutes there. They fell in love and created AFESIP in 1995.

             The Jeffrey Modell Foundation (JMF) is an international, non-profit, organization dedicated to helping individuals and family members affected by primary immunodeficiency disorders. The foundation is active in four main areas: research, physician and patient education, patient support, and public awareness of primary immune deficiency. The foundation provides funding of research fellowships and laboratory facilities; sponsors physician symposia in the United States, Canada, and Europe as well as grand rounds, seminars, and other educational activities for physicians; offers publications for both the lay and medical communities; and provides affected individuals with access to leading medical centers with departments of clinical immunology. The JMF also sponsors K.I.D.'s (Kids with Immunodeficiency) Days for affected children and their families; is engaged in ongoing education campaigns to promote awareness of primary immune deficiency (PI) in the general public; conducts advocacy on behalf of affected individuals; and is committed to ongoing biomedical research into primary immune deficiency.

             To date, the Foundation has funded twenty-eight post-doctoral fellowships and four Jeffrey Modell Endowed Chairs in Pediatric Immunology Research. In addition, in 2007 the Jeffrey Modell Immunology Center was established at Harvard Medical School.

             More than thirty years after its creation, the Jeffrey Modell Foundation continues its mission of hope, advocacy, and action by vigorously supporting physicians, researchers, and the ever-expanding global patient community - directing its efforts toward early diagnosis, meaningful treatments, equal access to care, and ultimately, cures for Primary Immunodeficiency. During our journey, we have had the privilege of working alongside many courageous and inspiring individuals, who have also created patient advocacy organizations in honor of or in memory of a child…specifically, the Immune Deficiency Foundation (IDF), SCID Angels for Life, Wiskott-Aldrich Foundation (WAS), Chronic Granulomatous Disease Foundation (CGD), the International Patient Organization for Primary Immunodeficiency (IPOPI), as well as all of the other dedicated patient organizations throughout the world. Together and united, we have shaped one strong message and one strong voice that will resonate for generations to come.

              Back in May, the hackers allegedly tried to blackmail several website administrators by threatening to release data about the registered members onto the Internet if they did not get paid one million dollars.
             </p>
             <p>
              According to ASMALLWORLD Holdings Inc., the company running the website, the risk to its high-profile users was rather small, because there was no financial or sensitive information stored in the compromised database. Nevertheless, the authorities were notified and the French police's special division for fighting cybercrime, L'Office Central de Lutte contre la Criminalitée liée aux Technologies de l'Information et de la Communication (O.C.L.C.T.I.C), and the FBI collaborated on the investigation that eventually led to the arrest of the two Frenchmen.

The evening was hosted by Seth Meyers, with a dinner menu designed by Mario Batali, and a performance by Michael Buble. Lorna Kelly of Paddles8 conducted an auction that raised more than $500,000, which was matched by an anonymous donor, bringing the evening’s total funds raised to over $3.5 million.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             MIAMI, Sept. 18, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Nightlife icon Michael Capponi and software guru Gideon Kimbrell announced the planned rollout of their revolutionary mobile app InList Tuesday evening on the rooftop of the Dream Downtown in New York with Katie Holmes, Rohan Marley and DuJour Magazine Founder Jason Binn.
            </p>
            <p>
             InList is a members-only mobile app that enables users to book coveted reservations at a curated list of music festivals and upscale nightlife venues around the world.

            </p>
            <p>
             Michael Capponi, a hyper-connected nightlife impresario considered one of the original pioneers of South Beach, tapped his global network of club owners and promoters to launch InList and its proprietary platform was developed by serial entrepreneur and software engineer Gideon Kimbrell.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Guests included CEO of Cablevision Jim Dolan, CEO of Furla USA Jim Mullaney, Gilt's Keith George, founder of Dream Hotels Vikram Chatwal, co-head of talent at ICM Partners Adam Schweitzer, LVMH's Gena Smith, NBC reporter Brian Steel, editor-in-chief of DuJour Media Nicole Vecchiarelli, Jane and Richie Notar of Notar Hospitality, Shawn Modell of Modell Sports, Mari Vanna's Tatiana Brunetti, Zegna's Shauna Brook, Roberto Cavalli's Cristiano Mancini, Max Mara's Veronica Pankratova, LeFrak's Camille Douglas, A Small World founder Erik Wachtmeister, Moinian Group's Natasha Vardi, and Maserati's Eric Sheiffer.
            </p>
            <p>
             The InList app is available for iPhone and Android and will continue expansion to include another set of international nightlife capitals. There are plans to introduce a web platform for online bookings under the direction of Kimbrell, previously a software engineer for various Fortune 100 Companies including

             Michael Capponi=the new Epstein? -

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              ..Something is very off about Capponi's childhood. Capponi has claimed to have been making $10,000 a month while still at high school. No club promoter makes that. So how does he pluck that figure out? Where was that money coming from?..
             </p>
             <p>
              This article explains how Capponi ended up a homeless drug addict on the streets of New York in the winter 1995. He then went to Belgium to get better but ended up in a coma for three months, then went to Canada for more R&amp;R. Once better he then returned to Miami. What this article fails to mention is that just 4 years after the lowest point in his life his life he was being asked to invest in a new nightclub and for some bizarre reason had decided to go do humanitarian work in the Kosovo crisis of 1999.
             </p>
             <p>
              ..Another thing this article mentions which is very important is that back in Europe his father and grandfather were famous nightclub owners..&gt;So Oliver Hoyos, European nobility, relative of wealthy bankers. Joins forces with Michael Capponi. Why? Because the name Capponi is part of the Italian Black nobility mafia. Look up Gino Capponi from the 1800s. He was a Knight of the Order of Saint Joseph. Well guess who is a council member for the Miami St. Joseph church in Miami beach? Danoushka Capponi - Michael Capponi's mother. Michael Capponi and his mother may very well be members of the Italian Black Mafia. Who has now joined up with a descendant a elite bankers, European count, to do business. Ask yourselves, do you trust these two people with their backgrounds to be doing honest work?
             </p>
             <p>
              Little Pizzagate reference. Oliver Hoyos now runs a burger restaurant in Germany called Burger Baby. Sick. So blatant.
             </p>
             <p>
              Back to Michael Capponi and his mother Danoushka Capponi. She works for his Global Empowerment Mission company. Guess who also works with them? Bethenny Frankel. The reality TV star. Frankel is very interesting for a couple of reasons. One is that her father and stepfather were successful horse trainers. Now that is an industry full of corruption. Horses, cash, gambling. Big time money laundering stuff. The second thing that's interesting about Bethenny Frankel is her late boyfriend Dennis Shields was a financier who lived in Trump Towers and died of an overdose.
             </p>
             <p>
              ...One of Capponi's best friends is a guy called Moishe Mana. Moishe is big in the storage industry including storing fine art and wine. The Capponi family in Italy own a winery. We also know people who transport fine art can get around intrusive customs rules. Seems like a guy to know if you're into human trafficking and organ trafficking.

             </a>
             EDIT: He runs a travel agency and was the facilitator for Pathan and his wife. According to the article, "During the raid three CPUs and three hard disks were seized from Dixit's office along with some other incriminating documents." This will be worth following up on to see if we can learn where in the U.S. and Mexico they were delivering the girls.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Global Fund for Children (GFC) is a Washington, DC-based nonprofit organization whose mission is to transform the lives of the world's most vulnerable children. .. In 2006 GFC, American Jewish World Service, EMPower-The Emerging Markets Foundation, Firelight Foundation, Global Fund for Women and Mama Cash[8] joined forces with the Nike Foundation to establish the Grassroots Girls Initiative (GGI). GGI was the first donor consortium devoted exclusively to grassroots solutions for adolescent girls.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2007 GFC launched its Under-8 Initiative (U8), a pledge to invest $10 million over five years in groups working with children under the age of 8 in developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The initiative was sponsored by the Clinton Foundation as part of the Clinton Global Initiative.[10] Within the first year of operation it reached an estimated 47,000 children in 19 countries and awarded a total of $487,300 in grants.... The Global Fund for Children will receive $275,000 over three years to partner with locally led, community-based organizations in Haiti that are assisting vulnerable children. The new grants bring the Hilton Foundation’s contributions to Haiti to $1,075,000."

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Count Erik Wachtmeister says he came up with the idea of an online social network for the elite when hunting boar on the Bismarck family’s Friedrichsruh estate in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein. “They have fantastic boar hunts every year,” he says, “there are suddenly 50 animals coming at you and it’s a real excitement, but then you can have three hours where nothing happens and you can have some good ideas.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Within five minutes of meeting him in the living room of his suite at the Connaught, I had been told about his successful banking career with Lehman Brothers and elsewhere, about a company he set up raising private money for publicly listed companies (“It was amazing, I could talk to you for hours about that”), that he has always had “very strong people skills”,
             <strong>
              that he was born into a noble family, that he has met five US presidents and that his father was “maybe one of the most successful international diplomats of all time” who was so close to George Bush Senior that they played tennis together twice a week.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             .
             <strong>
              .Wachtmeister launched A Small World at the same time as Facebook went online.
             </strong>
             After membership had risen to hundreds of thousands, he left the project five years later, in 2009, following disagreements with investor and movie producer Harvey Weinstein, whom he blames for neglecting the site itself in favour of selling advertising. He says allowing the high-profile Weinstein to come on board was “a big mistake”.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The latest Wachtmeister intervention in the world of social media is the inelegantly named Best of All Worlds
             </strong>
             , which launched yesterday and has already built up 25,000 members on its pre-released iPhone app, including billionaires and members of royal houses, I am assured. He says it is a step ahead of A Small World, not to mention Facebook and LinkedIn. “I mean what has Facebook done really? It’s all about self expression and showing off.”
