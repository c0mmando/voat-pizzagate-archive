<blockquote>
<p>I am only 8. We have traveled a long way to get here. A man in dark pants and a weird green shirt tells me to remove my clothes. A woman in a skirt that is too short doesn’t give me a chance to respond. I’m scared that if she bends over, it will not cover her bottom. I am worried for her. She reaches to my side, grabs the hem of my dress and swiftly pulls it over my head. My arms automatically go straight up and I no longer feel like my body is even mine. She places her thumbs in the elastic of my panties and the man yells stop. She looks at him. He tells her to leave them on. That the buyers are likely to bid higher just by fantasizing about what is under my white panties with the lace trim. He points out the tiny pink bow on the front. He gently touches it and then touches himself and quickly moves back to the tripod and camera he has facing me.
My picture is above the stage. Along with the pictures of about a dozen other girls. We are all kept together in a room. There are girls much smaller than me. Maybe 5 or 6 years old. And several girls that are much older, 12 to 14. Everyone is mostly naked. The room we are in is just off the room with the chairs, now full of men. There are men sitting. Men standing. Men everywhere. There are numerous women too. But more men. The room we are in has a curtain as a door. The woman who removed my dress holds the curtain open and we can see our pictures on the wall. Beneath our pictures are numbers. There is a very pretty girl who is 13. I know because it says 13 below her picture. The man at the projector is constantly changing the numbers beneath our names. Not the number that is our age, but the number of our bid.</p>
<p>it is best to be bought by one of the men in the front. They are rich. They will still hurt me, but the place will be nice. Most likely I will be fed. I will be allowed to clean up. It will hurt, I know. But it is less hurt than if one of the men in the back wins me. The men in the back are brokers. This means that they buy girls as cheaply as possible. Then take us to a place and resell us to as many men as they can in the time they are allowed.</p>

            As jarring as these recountings are, they are crucial components in 'touching' the wider audience that fervently does NOT want these abominations to be true.
           </p>
           <p>
            While healthy skepticism is always a prudent stance, the similarities that people such as Cathy O'Brien, Toos Nijenhuis, Brice Taylor, Fiona Barnett, and now Anneke Lucas have in their stories are WAY too repetitive to be mere coincidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, a disturbing recognition has been arising within me as to why the willful complacency amongst the wider public endures.
           </p>
           <p>
            People. Do. Not. Want. To. Believe.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once it strikes deeply within one's soul that this shit is going on, it is no longer possible to remain anonymously aloof in front of our computer screens.
           </p>
           <p>
            When one hears the shrieks down the hall, witnesses the blood and black eyes upon victims, no uncertainty can exist as to whether violence is taking place. An observer is then placed in a - usually involuntary - position of owning some responsibility in not stepping up and stopping the vileness.
           </p>
           <p>
            Engage, people.
Read, educate yourselves, please.
           </p>
           <p>

            Only takes a few minutes.

           <p>
            We are growing in size and impact to end this rampant violence upon our most vulnerable ... our children.
