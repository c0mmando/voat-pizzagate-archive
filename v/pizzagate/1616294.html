            Are you a survivor?  Have you ever gone through a grooming system and then tried to get out the other end while unable to know how to?    If yes, please share ideas what worked for you.
           </p>
           <p>
            No?
           </p>
           <p>
            Until  I"ve  walked a few years in his childhood  and adulthood I'll just support him to press charges, or to lobby  to get child abuse laws changed to extend past 6 yrs statue of limitations for child crime.
           </p>
           <p>
            It would be great if he could press charges,  but I doubt he's even got the money for that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Research  Stockholm Syndrome because it's a very real condition and I expect Corey has it even though he knows what happened was wrong.  It might be what causes him not to press charges, along with money and fear.  He needs a good therapist who knows how to interact around  his potential future legal charges.
           </p>
           <p>
            I  hope Corey can do that combination,  but even therapists cost money too. He might have to get an ordinary job to pay for it like  non-actors do.
           </p>
           <p>
            Have you read his book? He knew his friend Corey Haim's died right around the time  Feldman wanted to blow the lid.
            <br/>
            Then there's that little thing about the survival instinct that kicks in.
Sometimes I think, ::Give me freedom and healthy life or give me death:: .... then the survival instinct kicks in to conformity.
You too?  Yeah,  I thought so.
           </p>
           <p>
            I really want to support survivors to  get the right therapist, not the kind who's going to sabotage by introducing ideas to the survivor, causing the case  to get thrown   out in court.  But the kind trained to set them up for a successful litigation where they prosecute and work to change the statute of limitations for  child rape abuse survivors and cause actual changes in the way children are treated.  Politicians could give a shit because they're either knowledgeable  enablers or complicit themselves.

            That's easy for somebody to say who isn't in his situation.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was groomed and it's amazing he released himself to the extent he did.  He deserves  kindness, not hate.  Please.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd like to encourage  all victims  to  talk to a lawyer about possible charges toward   the perpetrators involved, even if it's past the legal time frame, (obviously a child isn't able to press charges so 6 yrs can't possibly apply to this situation... I'd like to see legislation changed, time frame extended for litigation in case of child abuse for this  reason.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Feldman knows that lawyers  take money and  a lot of courage to be smeared all over again - both of which he'll need if he names names.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hopefully we'll be a  SUPPORTIVE  group  who kindly encourages people rather than belittle them about the way they can and can't deal with their childhood abuse.
