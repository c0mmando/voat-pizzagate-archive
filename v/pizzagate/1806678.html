            I just keep commenting links on there. I get called a loon and get cussed out(by the same exact accounts that have been on there for over 10 hours defending the article) and after a while my comments disappear...but the truth needs to be seen. Anyone willing to join me, please help spread the word for normal people reading this at face value.

            We need to force a RETRACTION on this statement which is a lie --
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Welch walked through the building undeterred, shot a computer closet, then laid down his weapons and surrendered to the police in the middle of Connecticut Avenue. He will remain in prison for years.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Case against Welch at local level dismissed and he was released ... however ....

            No, the link included in the update at the top and bottom clearly shows him working his way through federal court
            <a href="https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/33f0rw6ts/district-of-columbia-district-court/usa-v-welch/">
             https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/33f0rw6ts/district-of-columbia-district-court/usa-v-welch/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            And the "evidence" that he "walked" a week later came from DC municipal court filings where, in plain English, it says "a federal arrest warrant has been filed against the defendant and will be executed by the USMS following the adjournment of this proceedings," meaning he walked right into the custody of US Marshals.

            If Brock's boyfriend had any sense he would have shut up a long time ago. This is the kind of nonsense that wakes up people who otherwise would have been on the fence or in denial. Something is clearly very wrong psychologically with somebody who continues to seek attention when it is his own bad behavior that caused people to look into the instagram account, the friends, the bands, et cetera. If the arrogant rub it in everyone's face approach is supposed to be a sign of great strength and brilliant strategy, it's actually coming off as weak, desperate, and sad. These people have dug their own graves. Maybe some of them were forced into it or whatever but it's long past time to get real.

            So I guess this confirms that the single gunshot did indeed hit a "computer closet".  How convenient! Wonder what was on that hard drive....

             I'm guessing that it isn't.  There was no need to destroy evidence.  JA's ass is covered.

              Why put that part in there unless there was something on that hard drive.  There was a password protected section on the website.  Of course, it's unclear if the computer even hosted the website.  But it's such an innocuous fact to include, it itself seems incriminating.

              There are other accounts that multiple shots were fired:

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Rounds fired possibly struck the walls, door and a computer, police spokeswoman Karimah Bilal said.

              I think they are waiting to release a copy of the police report until they get their story straight.

            Alefantis' article tries to suggest that Pizzagate is about his entire community being under attack.
How much of that community can be connected by pedophile symbols and connections to Alefantis or Clinton's?
Or to the underground tunnel network?
           </p>
           <p>
            Not sure, but is the actor who presented himself as a shooter at Comet Pizza actually
serving any time?  Thought that was ended very quietly with no prison time?

            And think some research here turned up father's connections to Haiti and child-protection?

           <p>
            At any rate, it's clear these guys are trying to get out into the sunlight again -- 
Hillary looks rejuvenated - lost weight-- better clothing -- refreshed and has put her toe in the water.
Now Alefantis suggesting all's well with the world via the Washington Post -- 
and presumably we will next see John Podesta re-emerging from his rat hole.

            Hmmm, is it a coincidence that JA article is on Wapo at 6:30am this morning (4/20/17) after I posted this comment on the Jason Chaffetz sub on voat around midnight last night?

Hmm, it seems to me that this can this be applied to JP, JA, HRC, Lois Lerner...anyone have any others they'd like to throw in? Even if not now, maybe sometime in the future.

            Pre-Miranda Silence

            WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court says prosecutors can use a person's silence against them if it comes before he's told of his right to remain silent. LAW OFFICER TACTICS: The Right to Remain Silent (The When &amp; How of Miranda Rights) The 5-4 ruling comes in the case of Genovevo Salinas, who was convicted of a 1992 murder. During police questioning, and before he was arrested or read his Miranda rights, Salinas answered some questions but did not answer when asked if a shotgun he had access to would match up with the murder weapon. Prosecutors in Texas used his silence on that question in convicting him of murder, saying it helped demonstrate his guilt. Salinas appealed, saying his Fifth Amendment rights to stay silent should have kept lawyers from using his silence against him in court. Texas courts disagreed, saying pre-Miranda silence is not protected by the Constitution. The high court upheld that decision.

            I truly hope Chaffetz and/or his family isn't being threatened. We know there are those who are not above doing so.

              Just realized.  Skippy said 'when they say it is about family, it is never about family' about an article on Jason Chaffetz retiring. The article doesn't mention or quote congressman Chaffetz mentioning family which made me wonder wtf Skippy was talking about...I suddenly can't help but wonder if Skippy did a slip there.

             Never mind.  I must have missed the first two paragraphs.  Could have sworn i read it twice looking for mentions of family

               Only mention of family in the article is something about Chaffetz being shamed by his daughter for voting trump after pussy grab but in no way is that a statement that he is retiring for family reasons.

            I was surprised the comment section was left on. But quickly realized the comments were part of the PSYOP also. The article is backfilling so that others who may stumble across pizzagate 5 or 10 years from now consider the issue a hoax. What would Winston Smith do?

            Do read the comments. I can't imagine any of the Alifantis sympathisers have even taken the time to look at any of the circumstantial evidence building up against him. Are they secretly afraid of what they might find or just intellectually incurious? Aren't they interested in what is happening to their country? Their ignorant smugness is really depressing.

              Boy, is that the truth (... Not everything is as it appears ). Sometimes I'm discouraged by seeing those with clearly acute discernment skills failing to use them when assessing the general flow of information.

            Weird timing if this has all been debunked etc and fake news narrative cemented.  All focus on nefarious trolls tactics, they're preparing for some proof dropping?
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's spam with the other unrelated pedo pizza parlors to prove it's not even a one time conspiracy.

            Also this is why white people will always lose.  We are total pussies.  Blacks will flash mob a 711 to save 5 bucks.  Our toughest Bronx dudes went there and just asked JA polite questions.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we had a physical location we could flood them and  be gone before any LE came.  Live streaming the whole thing.  What's the matter pussies is PG not real?

             I didn't watch any of it and won't download anything (just the knowledge that this sick shit goes on is bad enough) but the people who saw what was on it said it was the stuff of nightmares. Think Hostel but with a little boy. I hated the world and everything in it after reading the descriptions of what was on it, no wonder the Comet shooter just 'happened' to shoot through Comets computer server.

              Since the "shooting" was a false flag, and reports of how many shots were fired  varied (some witnesses said they heard NO shots), who even knows if that part is true?  It could be bullshit, just like the rest of the story.
