            Well I have to eat some kind of paper since Newsweek put out on article on May 17, 2017 about the significance of the lawsuit. I didnt check to see if came out before or after the RT story:  dont really want to do any research.  It did mention that the federal judge has a reputation for being very anti- corruption . I still can't find a definitive ruling on the service of process. It has to have been resolved because you couldn't get to a motion to dismiss without proper service. Sometimes it's done simultaneously in mickey-mouse casss,  certainly not in a big one like this.  Something I didn't realize was that it was filed before  Wikileaks  published the emails.

             "Deep State politics has become a shooting gallery. Body trail a mile long" AND SPANNING DECADES. "Pedogate running rampant." I've been following the Clinton body count for many years while most of those I pointed it out to look at me as a nutcase. The fact that there are 14091 subscribers and 500 users on this subverse online as I type and that it's being Tweeted and picked up by independent investigators and ridiculed by Killary, the conspirators and their minions indicates to me that the tables have turned and we need to continue applying the pressure until some of the rats confess in hopes of cutting a deal and saving their own hides. When more of the rats turn, those sitting on the fence won't be able to equivocate for long and will have to choose sides.

            I wonder what it was that Shawn Lucas could have testified about...did he play a bigger role other than serving the lawsuit on D.N.C.?  Russian Times has an article on the total M.S.M. blackout surrounding this litigation.  Based upon the recent Motion to Dismiss hearing, it is my opinion that the D.N.C. is going to lose that motion and the judge's order denying it will be lengthy  and  will send a shock wave throughout the political arena    It will be interesting to see if M.S.M. ignores the judge's order as well.

             My understanding is that the DNC motion to dismiss was based on an argument of improper service and Shawn Lucas would have been in a position to testify since he served the suit at DNC HQ and the actual service was all documented on video and posted on the internet for all to see.

              I'm pretty sure they got past that point. I  read the oral argument on the issue of whether the plaintiffs had stated  a valid cause of action.  The judge was with the Plaintiffs every step of the way, even bringing up points the lawyers failed to make. It should be a landmark decision. And I'll eat my law licence if I'm wrong washed down with a double martini.

               I don't know what they are going to do to turn this around to their benefit, only maybe the judge winding up on a slab. God Forbid. That would be a huge red flag and point a huge finger at the DNC.  I am keeping my fingers crossed, Yeah and the papers being served is on video, that is going to be a really big problem.

               Then by all means keep us informed about how the lawsuit proceeds, since the MSM will bury it and it will fall to the alternative media to publicize whether any of the plaintiffs, plaintiff's attorneys or witnesses meet an untimely demise due to a trachea-crushing "workout accident", fentanyl overdose, "suicide" by defenestration, "heart attacked" or are found dead and washed up on Hollywood Beach with skull trauma.
