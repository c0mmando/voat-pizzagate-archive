             Alan H. Gill, CEO of the American Jewish Joint distribution Committee (JDC), announced today his plans to step down in 2016 after more than two decades of service with the Jewish aid group. In order to ensure a seamless transition of executive leadership, Gill will continue as CEO through the transition to his successor and has agreed to serve as executive advisor through the duration of 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
             “It has been the greatest honor of my life that for more than two decades, JDC has been my second home and the main driver of my core belief that all Jews are responsible for one another,” said Gill. “I came to the decision that by next year, we will have achieved many of the critical milestones I set out to accomplish and it is the right time to return to Israel and my family there.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Before relocating to NYC to become CEO, Gill served as the organization’s Executive Director for International Relations in Israel where he created and built a financial resource development operation to support the organization’s growing global humanitarian program. He was instrumental in the launch of a number of flagship JDC initiatives in Israel and the former Soviet Union and also served as a member of JDC’s emergency relief team during the 2008 Russia-Georgia war.
            </p>
            <p>
             JDC’s CEO Search Committee, currently in formation, will be chaired by JDC Vice President Jacob Schimmel and will shortly begin a global search for Gill’s successor.

            The block was in fact purchased on the same day, and by the same companies, or at least listed as such. CON NEB LiC, and a property management company based in Northern Virginia (H.A. Gill). As far as the block being sold for $0, that's how it appears in real estate databases. In the DC government property queries, the sales price appears as "unavailable". In order to confirm this, please go to
            <a href="https://corp.dcra.dc.gov">
             https://corp.dcra.dc.gov
            </a>
            , create an account, and do a search on each of these properties.
           </p>
           <p>
            I talked to a family member who worked commercial real estate in DC - and she said that reports like that aren't that uncommon. It may be that they simply failed to report to the agencies what the actual sales price was, possibly a transfer of title from an older version of a company to a newer (perhaps a restructure), possibly the addition of the management company on the title, or one of a number of other things. Some possibilities are more suspicious than others. I should also add that selling an entire block is actually very common practice in DC.
           </p>
           <p>
            CONNEB II LLC appears to be a company registered in Vienna, VA. You can see the listings here:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            H.A. Gill at least has a website:
            <a href="http://www.hagill.com/">
             http://www.hagill.com/
            </a>
            They manage and sell property in DC.
           </p>
           <p>
            The location for CONNEB is a single family home. I'd swing by and check out who it is, but the house was sold in October. The registered agent for the company was a "Kevin McCarthy". This could be the actual agent, or the owner of the LLC representing himself as an agent. The business entity claims an alternate address at H.A Gill (the aforementioned property management company) There are a few notable Kevin McCarthy's in the area. One is a US congressman from California. Another is a man who works investment brokerage for AFL-CIO (interesting). Another is a doctor with his own clinic in Bethesda, MD.
           </p>
           <p>
            CON NEB II LLC could very well be an independent property investor using an LLC to manage his taxes, a company set up so that a handful of people could invest in the block, or as a means for foreign investors to own American property. We have no idea.
           </p>
           <p>
            TL;DR: The ownership of this block is registered to two American companies, one being an established property management company, and the other may very well be just a handful of investors (foreign or domestic). There is no evidence of Saudi involvement. There is also no proof that the block was sold for $0, and we cannot ascertain what event led to the particular listing as such.

              Our hearts go out to the people of Haiti, and the wider region, in the wake of Hurricane Matthew's devastation,” said Alan H. Gill, JDC's CEO.

              Is there any link of H.A. Gill &amp; Son, a company based in DC that deals in property management and realty and this Alan Gill in NYC? Yes, they have the last name "Gill" in common. Anything else? I mean, Gill is a pretty common last name in America.
             </p>
             <p>
              The only man working at H.A. Gill &amp; Son with the name of "Gill" that I can find is a John W. Gill - who has apparently worked in the industry for around 30 years.

            I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, but this is addressed to everyone else also.

            This "Zero Dollars" thing has come up before. The "For Free" or "Sum of Zero Dollars" thing may be an issue with the source website that doesn't give actual information on the money that changed hands unless you're signed in or a paid up member. So it defaults to "$00" when you just lurk the page.
           </p>
           <p>
            You need to go double check the source to make sure these properties were
            <em>
             actually
            </em>
            exchanged for Zero Dollars.
           </p>
           <p>
            Checking on a name that comes up repeatedly is fine though.

            I searched Wikileaks, found something. Not sure yet what it means, if anything. I searched H.A. Gill and Sons. Looks like they deal in real estate and Ted Davis might be the point man.

            Forgive CAPS. I copy/pasted Titles from Wikileaks and they were already in CAPS.
