            Project Bluebeam. That's all you need to know. Read up on Project Bluebeam, and also check out this video of Ronald Reagan on the subject of an "alien invasion." Put two and two together, and you'll figure out that (((they))) are going to stage an alien invasion using a combo of holograms and directed energy weapons, and then humanity will GLADLY accept a New World Order to "fight the aliens."

            But something DID get announced on 10/11. Podesta's buddy Tom DeLonge announced he was launching, "To the Stars Academy of Arts &amp; Science. The organization comprises scientists, aerospace engineers and other creatives who will collaborate and enable researchers to explore the 'outer edges of science' and technologies."
            <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/tom-delonge-announces-to-the-stars-academy-of-arts-science-w508312">
             https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/tom-delonge-announces-to-the-stars-academy-of-arts-science-w508312
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Many believe that Podesta was DeLonge's anonymous source for his book Sekret Machines: Gods in conjunction with an EP. "The Sekret Machines project is about "Unidentified Aerial Phenomena". The project blends sources from the "military and intelligence community" with a "story about people across the world and history who have seen something impossible lighting up the night sky."
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasing_Shadows_(EP)">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasing_Shadows_(EP)
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            As an aside, notice how DeLonge spells "Sekret" and that the "c" is replaced with a "k" just like in MK-Ultra and how many victims of CIA mind control feel compelled to use a K instead of a C.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also ask
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Wisconsin_is_Corrupt">
             @Wisconsin_is_Corrupt
            </a>
            what he thinks of DeLonge.
           </p>
           <p>
            Podesta's tweet wasn't a warning to those of us investigating PG. I have no doubt it's part of the indoctrination process leading up to Project Bluebeam.

             Huh, I met one of the  (multiple) authors of those Sekret Machines books once.  I just thought he was a fairly talented but vastly too smug guy who took anything the Dems said as gospel.

             With all the "aliens" hashing it out on twitter, Masonic delong and skippy the trauma art loving podesta promising "disclosure" , and the increase of sightings ( I've seen'em whatever and whoever they are; recently too), I'm expecting blue beam in full effect by winter. Also, anyone wonder if delonges unusual book release was more intentional than not. I mean, it was one of the first things I found after the podesta "p@ssword" release.

              I think in DeLonge they found exactly what they needed-- a mind control victim with a built-in following who for whatever reasons, became obsessed with the "secret space program" and aliens. I just couldn't bring myself to read his book, which from what you say, is no loss. Even "ex" NSA guy Jim Stone is talking about the spirals and showing blue images of them and how it's not humans creating this. I think TPTB softening up the public with the idea of aliens, and then they'll create massive chaos with huge false flags, and then they'll call in their spaceships like Noah's arks. And those who get on are not going to a better place. It'll be an assembly line for organs and blood and souls. Nothing more, nothing less.
