            Secret committee? FREEMASONS. Isn't Canada's upper echelons run by Freemasons? They're everywhere.

             Yes CPS is a problem in Canada too, clear indications of institutional pedo issues going right to the top. I was going to support Alberta premier Notley to take on Trudeau for federal elections, she has a real shot. But her dad was a politician too, in itself that isn't a problem but any politician who is "legacy" is getting early suspicion from me from here on out. Also i was travelling to calgary a few months ago and read about a baby named Serenity who died in the CPS system, the article was graphic and i was bawling my eyes out in the restaurant reading the newspaper. I made a post about it on my FB that i was going to withdraw my support for Notley (i have some NDP party members on my friendslist) because the secrecy they were trying to maintain was a huge red flag for me in light of pizzagate. The only reason it made the news was the opposition party saying they were making it public no matter what. The next week, they changed up the tribunal and replaced the chair of the investigative commission undertaking serenity's inquiry and releasing the final report to the public. Obvs not because of me, but they are clearly responding quickly to PR threats, likely in a run up for federal campaigning. Plus she was a lefty and because of clinton i am suspicious of them now. I'm more centre, Stephen Harper pushed me left and Clinton pushed me to the right.

            From what I've been seeing, the CPS/Foster Care/Adoption system is one of the real horrors that needs uncovering and reform. This article is just one example:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Consider the tragedy of 13-year-old Mona Sock, who died in 2007.
            </p>
            <p>
             After reviewing Mona's death, the committee told the public there should be better guidelines for background checks on foster parents.
            </p>
            <p>
             What the committee did not tell the public — but which CBC News has learned from legal documents and interviews with her family and the province's former child advocate — is that Mona lived in a foster home with a convicted sex offender, while under the supervision of a First Nations child welfare agency. It appears that no one did a background check on him. That man, Lonnie Francis, sexually abused her.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the day her abuse was revealed to police, Mona hanged herself behind the recreation centre on Elsipogtog First Nation.
            </p>
