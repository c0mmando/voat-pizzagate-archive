             Ya, I got that for sure. Thing that I find odd, I cannot find anything about this task force on the FBI's website. Nor can I find their logo anywhere other than that video. I can only find them "mentioned" by name in articles. I would think that I should be able to find out more about them such as who is in charge of the department or how to contact them to report human trafficking possibly....

              In any case, there are 1000's of task forces across the US. Task forces are formed, perform a very specific task for some period of time and disband usually. You don't hear about most of them, won't be able to "look them up" or anything that like.
             </p>
             <p>
              I do not find it suspicious that a task force may A.) not be searchable if it has been since disbanded or B.) not want to be on the radar, especially area-specific ones involved in trafficking.
             </p>
             <p>
              When drug dealing became rampant in the area here, the police formed a task force of narcotics detectives to work our specific county. You don't get to know it exists when its in operation and only reason you would is if you worked as an informant or got busted by them. Later we found out through the news after their task was finished because they identified and busted the main players in the area and that specific task force was dismissed.

             <p>
              It is a task force, not a department. You contact the FBI for those types of tips. Why in the world would you think you would contact an area specific task force? Huge assumptions there.

               I dont know how all this stuff works. All I know is the logo they have has a logo similar to other pedophile logos, using the big small hand connection which I feel can be nothing, but is also odd at the same time.
