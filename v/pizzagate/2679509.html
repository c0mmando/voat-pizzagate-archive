<p>Article Text:
The theory pointing out for the truth or existence of an organ harvesting has live on, amid the discovery of alleged hundreds of children bodies in Malaysia.</p>
<p>Early reports, suggested that the bodies found in Malaysia were victims of organ harvesting, but cited news outlet has rebuked their stories.</p>
<p>Continuing and following the open source investigation as it moves forward, evidence is beginning to mount in support of George Webb’s organ harvesting hypothesis.</p>
<p>Webb’s Day 122 has highlighted the discovery of the bodies of 700 children in Malaysia in late 2016.</p>
<p>Local Authorities believed that the children were victims of an ‘organ farm’.</p>
<p>In support of this theories, according to theworldbeast.com cut marks were evident on the children’s bodies.</p>

<p>“Some of them are tied. Some are even packed into card board boxes. The pictures suggest that the crime has been carried out by a large gang,” the site continue.</p>
<p>“The children must have been kidnapped first. Then, their organs were harvested. These stolen organs must have been sold in the black market,” it added.</p>
<p>Talking more on origins of organ trafficking, open source investigator George Webb has linked the organ harvesting activities to regions where the US government contractor DynCorp has been operating.</p>
<p>Moreover, these countries include Haiti, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan among others. DynCorp’s involvement in human trafficking in the Balkans has been well documented and the origins of organ harvesting also have roots in the region.</p>
<p>Also, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) has been accused of organ harvesting during the period of 1998-1999. Dick Marty published a 2010 report for the European Council on organ harvesting and trafficking in Kosovo and Albania.</p>
<p>Marty’s report specifically names Kosovo president Hashim Thaci, then leader of the KLA, as being involved in organ harvesting.</p>
<p>Here’s the overview of the European Council Report, as collated of the 2010 Wikileaks document describes the reports findings:</p>
<p>“In the wake of the armed conflict, before international forces had time to re-establish law and order there, “organs were removed from some prisoners at a clinic in Albanian territory, near Fushe-Kruje…” he added.</p>
<p>An alleged harvested children bodies found in Malaysia</p>
<p>“Those organs were then “shipped out of Albania and sold to private
overseas clinics as part of the international ‘black market’ of
organ-trafficking for transplantation.”</p>
<p>This was carried out by KLA leaders linked to organised crime, and “has
continued, albeit in other forms, until today…” he wrote.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Marty specifically named Thaci, one of the KLA leaders during the conflict with Serb security forces in 1998-1999, in his report.</p>
<p>As described by Marty, Thaci, was “the boss” of the Drenica Group, a “small but inestimably powerful group of KLA personalities” who took control of organised crime in the region from at least 1998.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the very recent death of Vitaly Churkin, Russia’s permanent Ambassador to the UN, who was a leading advocate for an investigation into the allegations of KLA involvement in organ harvesting, has raised suspicions of foul play.</p>
<p>Going back to the recent bodies discovery in Kuala Lumpur, Webb firmly believes that the 700 children in Malaysia are children originating from Syria and therefore give his dark theory more weight.</p>
<p>Organ harvesting’s citing has been discovered all around the globe mostly Europe, Asian and some Caribbean areas. But all theories will become theory, as the investigation continues truth will always on hide.</p>',

            I was curious as to the SanQua logo on the girls cardboard box. It refers to SanQua bottled water made in Malaysia for domestic use only, no exports. This led me to a rojakpot.net website describing hoaxes, including the story of the girl in the cardboard box.
           </p>
           <p>
            The photo of the dead girl  is described as very real but not part of any kidnapping/smuggling/organ harvesting activity. However the photo was used to warn the public about such crimes against children and to safeguard your children. The same message goes out using different but equally horrible photos. No info was provided as to who is behind warnings.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the dead  girl, she is a bonafide victim whose body was wrapped up in SanQua cardboard. Because of other garbage near her perhaps her remains were placed in a dump or garbage truck...which is speculation on my part. The website directs you to the real story of her death but that page is no longer active. I'll edit if I find more.

              you are welcome, I wish I could figure out how to copy and paste links, folks are just gonna have to trust that I do my homework. I give enough detail that anyone can google and find the link. In Jaharta, Putri is known as the "girl in a cardboard box".  How sad, she looks like she was found rather quickly and she looks like she was very pretty. Her parents must be crushed.

               There are two ways to do it. First, just select, copy, put your cursor where you want the link and paste. Second way is to select the url, copy, highlight the wording in the text of your comment that you want to turn into a hot link, click the third formatting button (looks like two chain links), and paste the url into the little box that opens up. If you can't see the formatting buttons, select "view desktop site" in your browser window (if on phone or tablet).
              </p>
              <p>
               Once in while, Voat disallows certain link/urls. When that happens, go to
               <a href="https://archive.is">
                https://archive.is
               </a>
               and paste the url there. Then copy the new url it gives you of the archived page and paste that in your Voat comment. You can also paste the link and then add some spaces in the middle so Voat doesn't recognize it.

            , I'm flairing this Debunked. No organ harvesting involved, or human trafficking. It did not happen in Malaysia or Thailand. This was a gas attack during the Syrian civil war:

             Photos are mixing ethnicities. The Indonesion girl was raped, murdered and packaged for a landfill, the culprit was an adult  neighbor who did weird things with local  children, believed to be a pedophile, see my comments below.  Before tossing out  the post maybe the group photo will be be identified. Our job is to separate  out the wheat from the chaff.

              The group photo is from a gas attack in Syria during their civil war. She the comment I left when I flaired it Debunked. You are correct about the girl being a murder victim, as well.

              I could be wrong, but, I have good reason for my theory.

             Analysis:
            </h2>
            <p>
             A disturbing image showing dead bodies of few children lying on ground is shared widely on social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp with different stories attached to it. Some purport to show that Tamil Nadu police have found the bodies of children in one truck container, saying they were kidnapped from different parts of country and that all their body parts were removed. Others suggested that Thailand police found dead bodies of hundreds of Malaysian children in a container vehicle, with their organs harvested. Although the picture showing dead bodies of children is real, and the messages warned people to take care of their children, the claim as such is not a fact.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Not a Case of Kidnapping and Organ Harvesting
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             The picture has been doing rounds on social media and other image sharing platforms and the stories warning people of children kidnapping and organ harvesting have been reported by some uncredible websites online. However, if the group of children were killed in such disturbing manner, the incident would have easily made into news and become popular online. There’s no such report in mainstream news outlets in Thailand, Malaysia or Tamil Nadu.

              Chemical Attack in Ghouta, Syria
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             The children seen in the picture are real and they are all dead, but the unfortunate incident is not any case of kidnapping and organ harvesting, it actually shows the aftermath of a chemical attack that occurred in Ghouta during the Syrian Civil War on 21 August 2013. As you can see in couple of other pictures, the bodies of children are intact and no signs of organ harvesting are visible. Two opposition-controlled areas in the suburbs around Damascus City (Syria) were struck by rockets containing the chemical nerve agent Sarin. The chemical attack was carried out also against civilians, including children, on a relatively large scale causing hundreds of deaths and mass casualties.
            </p>
            <p>
             ~
            </p>
            <p>
             The chemical attack in Ghouta took place during regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which was accused by Western powers and the Syrian opposition. Later in October 2013 Syria officially joined the United Nations Chemical Weapons Convention, destroying the stockpiles of chemical weapons gradually.
So the stories claiming the picture shows dead bodies of hundreds of children kidnapped and their organs removed are hoaxes.

             Be careful when fact checking news on Syria. The MSM keeps trying to use false flag attacks to drum up support for war.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't have time to look into this story, but if I did, I would start by looking into Eva Bartlett's and Vanessa Beeley's work - reporters who have been to Syria and spoken to Syrians. I might look at Caitlin Johnstone and Jimmy Dore, since they put some effort into fact checking the Syria story and cite Bartlett and Beeley as sources.

              This article claims that there was no chemical attack in 2013
             </a>
             . Some sources mention that workers who come to scenes after attacks do not dress as they should if chemicals were really used. As for the 2018 attack, I read somewhere that people died from asphyxiation from being trapped in a dust-filled tunnel, not from chemicals.

               I think you've got me confused with someone else. I haven't mentioned Q once here, and I only have one other post so you can verify this quickly.

                 :  does this forum really have to tolerate the terrible behavior like argociv here?  We all hate rules  and censorship but some folks go too far which can inhibit participation by a newcomer who is on the receiving end of such insults.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There is also the element of fairness here. It took me 30 minutes to find the source of the photo of the dead girl in the box and to make a series comments.  It only takes 10 seconds to tell a colleague to fuck off. And we are all colleagues for better or worse.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Anyone who is a shill and sifting thru our posts  will eventually  come to the realization that child trafficking is real (unless they are subhuman). Now when a shill is also a perpetrator of sex offenses, the more accurate reporting we do, the more that perp should start getting nervous that he'll be uncovered sooner or later.  Just saying.....

                  I agree with you, Pizzalawyer. Attacking other users especially with vitriol is not helpful on this subverse. Not sure what is going on here, as I am slogging through 103 notifications in the past 24 hours.

                    Good man. Also, thank you for providing your intelligent contributions on so many threads. That goes a long way toward refocusing conversation on useful topics when things devolve into drama.

                  The girl in the box is not what I questioned here.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It's the fake news being created by mixing it in with the photo of Syrians.

                 <p>
                  As for the person I'm being belligerent towards, it is not without reason - I keep track of a lot of things and when a 'newcomer' shows up trying to reply to me in what appears(to me) to be a suspicious manner, I bite back a little until I can be sure.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You can lob veiled threats at me all you like, sounds just like srayzie and her merry band, though - so no, you don't make me nervous at all because the accusations against me are baseless.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  PS: I've already contacted Task Force Argus about the slander I'm being subjected to.

                   relieved to see you defend yourself without vicious or vulgar language, its much more effective, dont you think? I lurked for a long time before climbing on board. I wanted to be sure this was a worthy forum.  Im sure I was not alone in this approach and if I was attacked on my first  few excursions, i would have gone away to spend time on Kardashian news.

                    Actually, no matter what I do here, srayzie, think- and Shizy continue to levy hysterical slander at me and organize mass-downvote brigading; it's only effective with people who are themselves, capable of maintaining composure.

             Read my replies, I covered all that...Look at the girl in the box....she has rigour mortis and her left foot is clearly broken...that is clearly an SE Asian girl, not Syrian..perhaps that image is from a one-off crime scene...Im not sure...also the images of large amounts of children does not show the grey-blue tint that was evidenced in the Syria chem attacks nor is there rigour mortis...obviously ALL these pictures are evidence of crimes against children.....where, what kind and who is what I am interested in

            I figured it was real. Why else would it have such a cult following? And at the same time trying to be debunked by labeling it a conspiracy theory.

            I’m on phone. Hashim Tacki PM of Kosovo is being investigated for arms &amp; drug trafficking plus organ harvesting. I did a post on it with a picture of him with Bill &amp; Hillary. There is a pic of him walking into Our White House with Joe Biden, who invited him. I kid you not. Turkey is heavily involved as well and Israel.

              I have seen that list a while ago.  It is a long list for sure.  That book may just rival the size of War and Peace.  We all know they have the power to pull it off, but I think the Bushes and others have also added to this list.  Including BO.

            RIP angels now in the arms of God. 
How can people be so cruel. There is a special place in hell awaiting them, maybe that why they don't want to die. They are both perpetrator, recipients of the organs and the eater of walnut sauce. This is win win for them. Thankfully people are waking up.

            I just realised theyre referencing George Webb which raises alarms with me. I wonder if these are Syrian victims of the chemical attacks from 2011ish? Except for the girl taped up in a box at the bottom of the article..wtf is that...also there is no discoloration as was the case with the chemical attack victims...

             The site you linked is a Fake News pusher. Look around at some of the articles they published in their Science category. Also, only first names for reporters. It's a disinfo site, pulling pics from old news stories and trying to pass them off as PG.

             Yes.. over a million  kids have been killed in Syria  in the past 7 years. It's the most horrific scene on the planet and the worst the world has seen since ww2. It's f'ing heartbreaking. Child trafficking  and sexual abuse are beyond rampant

             I think the story is bs especially with George Webbs name...he is psyop-ish but the kids all have bandages on their foreheads and the dead girl at the bottom is obviously real...i think "they" are covering these pictures in a BS story to take away from the obvious gruesomeness...

            Yeah right.  The images are far from graphic.  There's no blood.  The bodies are not the slightest bit mangled or decomposed.  They could easily be alive and posing for the photos.  The article doesn't even give any details as to how or where they were found.
           </p>
           <p>
            At worst, this is complete bullshit.  At best, it's extremely poor journalism.

             how is ES's comment getting upvoated? The mystery behind the horrible death of the Indonesian girl in the cardboard box has been solved by at least 3 commentators below. We need to have open minds. One purpose to posting is the opportunity to explore on your own, not just a quickie response to a post that may or may not be valid.

              Looks like a real girl, yes.  But how can you tell she's dead?  If she is, she must not have been dead very long.  Look at her complexion.  She hasn't lost any color, her cheeks and eyes are not at all sunken.

             <p>
              If I had to guess, I'd say this is disinfo meant to distract.

               the girl's feet are curled past the point of anything possible while alive..that is rigour mortis...read my other replies...the photos I think are real, the story is obvious nonsense...especially if George Webb is ACTUALLY involved...

                The bent ankles are not enough for me to say she's dead.  I can bend my ankles that far and I'm still alive.  But the link

                provided has convinced me that she really is dead in the photo.  It also pretty much proves the story is nonsense, as you said.

                I'd suggest deleting the post, but I don't know if anyone takes this sub seriously anymore anyway with all the fuckery that goes on in here.

               I can't find the source right now, but I came across this last year, it's a real girl, but she was raped and murdered by a neighbor or Uncle I think, it was a well publicized case, I'll try to find the source, but this is wrong, of that I'm sure

            Poor kids. Fuck these people. Just throwing this out there, if anyone can answer some of these it might help open the issue up a bit to even greater understanding. What kind of equipment would you need to keep the organs viable during and after transport. soak them in propylene glycol and freeze them for long term storage? Refrigerated shipping containers? Was (((any)))) military ships in the area? Also I find the amount of victims strange is demand that high? or is there a way too keep them long term?

             Demand is very high. There has been research here on ship containers but seems no longer people interested. Sad. Israel needs lot of organs. They had a law. People could not donate organs Religeos reasons. Law  changed but some still did not. They use a lot of organs of Palestinian children.

               Ok. Now scroll down to R Young saying Jenny was no longer friends with GW. Also see her screenshot from Chan. That’s the one I wanted you to see. It means to me that she made a mistake about George. He tricked her. He could be involved in her death or missing. Idk. Could be DS or CIA. Or combo. She dropped him soon as she found he was 
a fooler.

             i think keep them alive then take what you need then refrigerate the bodies to keep other organs fresh...The pix with large amounts of kids are puzzling because they show no sign of life OR decay...like they were killed medically and THEN their bodies were found...I wish I had the original pics to forensically analyze them for dates and locations etc...

              It does not work that way.  Science has developed a drug that gives an organ 3 additional days to be vilable .   Organs need oxygen —- blood flow.
             </p>
             <p>
              I find the photo peculiar.   Why are so many there?
Were they doing like a 60 day waste management schedule?  I didn’t take the liberty of a magnifying glass..... the kids looked intact.  What were they doing there???? The adenchrome comes from the back of the neck.  All you need is a needle... 
I didn’t see the date on this article  something is off

                There is no documented evidence that I could find of adrenochrome ever being extracted from a human pineal gland.  BUT, there is documented evidence on the correct surgical procedure for accessing the pineal gland when a person presents with a pineal gland tumor.  That approach is the  posterior cranium, the back of the head.  The gland is in the cranium, not in the neck.

                 Thank you! The pineal gland has long been referred to as the third eye, a concept that I do not think is nefarious at all.  And that fluoride calcifies the pineal gland, supposedly weakening  our psychic capabilities / spiritual connection.  So that lends something to the idea that they would want to mess with someone's pineal gland, if in fact there is a way to do that that either hurts the victim and/or provides  a benefit  to the perpetrator.  Mostly conjecture, and but important and relevant I believe. Thanks again

               The needle is correct and your questions and info are correct. The number of children is odd to me too. They have perfected the harvesting but good at faking pics too.
