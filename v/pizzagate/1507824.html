            Yesterday I researched ritualistic abuse in my own country, back in the early 90s when this was a hot issue. Most articles back then cited Berkeley sociologist Richard Ofshe. Look him up. He has always been posing as a clinical psychologist. He created a (fault-ridden and scientifically dubious) 'experiment' out of the Paul Ingram case, by 'implanting' 'false' memories in Ingram's mind, then claiming the original interrogators did the same.
           </p>
           <p>
            Richard Ofshe. He has been the go-to-guy for explaining away 'scientifically' the many instances of ritualistic abuse recorded in the late 80s/early 90s. Even in my little old country, where ritualistic child abuse likely has been rampant among elites for many centuries, yet had rarely been reported on until that period.
           </p>
           <p>
            They probably didn't have their total mind control system up and running back then, which is why there was a short window into its workings back then. A window that would be closed quickly and squarely by the likes of Ofshe and the FMSF.
           </p>

            Reality is, they perfected their methods, and we will never find another victim to testify. Nor any hard or actionable evidence. They are everywhere. LE, judiciary, intelligence. Everywhere. They know the game. In the rare event of dropped threads, they have the power to cover them up. Or let a patsy walk away with minimal sentencing. There will never, ever, be a smoking gun. Or even a credible whistleblower.
           </p>
           <p>
            Funny thing is, the brunt of their argument is carried by the statement that if there were such a widespread and insidious cult, it would have been exposed long ago. Well, no. Even Edward fucking Snowden's security clearance was shared by up to half a million people. Conspiracies, when carried out at the tip of the spear, are actually *easy *to maintain.
           </p>
           <p>
            Truth is, it's not that hard to hide a crime when all potential witnesses feel their lives and those of their loved ones threatened. In fact most crimes never see the light of day. As any LEO could tell you.

            This guy, Lanning, was eventually exposed as a disinformation. He is always sited by anyone denying satanic ritual abuse. He is nothing but a tool much like what MSM is doing right now regarding Pizzagate. The False Memory Syndrome Foundation are another  group that denounces Ritual abuse. Most connected to FMSF are involved in pedophilia and I think 2 founding members were charged.This is the best they can do is parade around these fucking losers that promoted the satanic panic B.S.Lanning's report was in 1992!! There are literally thousands of people that have come out  regarding the harsh reality of Ritual Abuse. Hundreds of blogs and websites devoted to exposing it.http://www.screamsfromchildhood.com/hoax_false_memory.html

             Why would I get a down vote on this?? Trying to clarify some things that maybe others aren't aware of?? Is it because I am speaking the unspeakable? That ritual abuse exists?? By the way, chances are, any children that have been abused around the pizzagate Washington DC investigation, they most likely have been subjected to some of this. Maybe not all, but some. Especially if they were very young as that is when the training begins

             Read down you'll see Kenneth Lanning's name and also that The False Memory Syndrome Foundation was a C.I.A. front. to debunk, ridicule, and defame victims of Satanic Ritual Abuse, pedophilic sexual abuse, and CIA cult mind control activities. The board members of FMSF reads like a Who’s Who of CIA contractors and “consultants”

            This is an FBI report from 1992. I did a search but I didn't see anything posted about this yet. I haven't read all the way through it but it looks like it should have some good information.
