            well... at the core of the problem is the cia. formed by edgar hoover in the fifties it is a corrupt paedophile organisation that has been working with british intelligence from the beginning to pull the wool over our eyes. it does experiments on people to further their capacity to control us. and they have been using the media to create the narrative of their choice. they are in cahoots with the bankers and the politicians to form the ..... yes ..... new...world....order. which is what the pope has been putting out there and i think that is why pell has been served up on a platter to australia over his child abuse to appease the masses so they trust his advice. its just horrible when you realise you've been manipulated all your life by sadist paedophile criminal lunatics who worship lucifer and only want us for our money. i am a slave. you are a slave. we are all slaves. freedom ? where ? my government tells me what to do. the same government that committed genocide on the australian aboriginal people and proceeded to steal rape and murder their children under the guise of caring for them. its all just a big lie and we are all just part of the matrix.

            Agree with EricK below as it is just a matter of time.  However, I think it is CRITICAL that we wake up enough people so that they are not traumatized or just shut down.  If you would have told me 2 years ago the world was ruled by lizard aliens and managed by ritualistic satanist who eat children...I would have laughed you out of the room...and I always have been a pretty awake and aware guy.  Narrative trains need to run their course..we got on an early one=pizzagate...others running..fall of NWO, 911 truth, UFO truth/disclosure, etc, etc..all trains led to the same station...

            It's just a matter of time, a strong tool for them is CNN and it's burning down to the ground. Next, people will start to wake up to the dark, bitter reality and demand some answers, and I underline answers. The Satanic Pedophiles are losing on every front. It's just a matter of time, I mean people are getting RedPilld and Mad every Day.

             Why don't you apply the same standard to the "evidence" Donald Trump paid "The Russians!(tm)" to hack Hillary and the DNC?
            </p>
            <p>
             It's odd isn't it? Both stories have about the same about of credibility but boy do you sure like to keep "The Russians did it!(tm)" charade going.
            </p>
            <p>
             You have ZERO evidence AND the former heads of the CIA and FBI and the former President of the United States have all said there was little to no evidence of Trump ever doing what he's been accused of.

            <p>
             Comet Ping Pong was dismissed by a 23 year old New York Times Consumer Electronics reporter but the former heads of the CIA, FBI and the United States of America can't get you to drop the Russian hacker story.

            <p>
             Why is that? It's weird, bizarre actually.
