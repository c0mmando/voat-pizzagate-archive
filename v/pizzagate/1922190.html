<p>That\'s pretty suggestive. It\'s obvious what was going on, but there\'s no documentation of Clinton\'s activities on the island, like witness reports or recordings or transcripts, that pin his activities down, like there were for Epstein when he got convicted of pedophilia in 2007.</p>
<p>But if we back up to the 1980s and 1990s, during Bill Clinton\'s governorship and presidency, a curious book was published in 1997 by an journalist from England, that has possibly the most exhaustive documentation ever compiled on Bill Clinton: including his activities with underage schoolgirls!</p>
<p>The story behind the book:</p>
<p>Cambridge-educated Ambrose Evans-Pritchard (gotta love those English names) built a career in journalism over the decades writing for <em>The Economist</em> and then <em>The Spectator</em> in the UK, then in 1991 he joined <em>The Telegraph</em>, and was assigned to Washington as a correspondent.</p>
<p>Evan-Pritchard is one of those journalists who likes to ask around and dig into documentation. Economics is his beat, and while in Washington he of course started digging into the financial scandals of the day, including Whitewater, the original Clinton scam. </p>
<p>He also did what few journalists in the day would do, which was to travel to Arkansas and try to get information on Whitewater right at the source. This may have begun as naivete, most American journalists were probably knowledgeable enough to know that going to Arkansas and digging around in the Clinton\'s dirty laundry could be hazardous to your health.</p>
<p>Ambrose was quickly filled in on that aspect of Arkansas investigative journalism, and realized that publicity was the way to stay safe. He published a series of articles about the financial scandals in <em>The Telegraph</em> that were blockbuster news in the UK, kept assiduously out of liberal MSM newspapers as one would expect, and quoted in conservative papers like <em>The Washington Times</em>.</p>
<p>While in Arkansas he also started unearthing explosive information, including coke use and underage girls. He actually took statements from witnesses who had been present at these &quot;coke &amp; kids&quot; parties. </p>
<p>There was no way to publish this even in <em>The Telegraph</em> but he kept researching an building his database, and then in 1997 he was recalled to London and has since moved up the ladder to become <em>The Telegraph</em>\'s International Business Editor:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/ambrose-evans-pritchard/">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/ambrose-evans-pritchard/</a></p>
<p>Anyways, once he was safely out of the United States, he published his information in the book: <em>The Secret Life of Bill Clinton: The Unreported Stories</em>, ISBN: 0895264080/978-0895264084. (For some reason voat won\'t let me include a link to the Amazon listing of this book, but even though it wasn\'t reprinted after 1997, if you do a search you\'ll be able to find copies on Ebay, Amazon, and the other online sites.)</p>
<p>Of course, it was kept assiduously out of the mainstream newspapers and book review sites, and it was never reprinted. Few people even know of its existence. But if you can get your hands on a copy, you\'ll find that, while it\'s a dense read, more like a textbook than a page-turner, it\'s a treasure trove of documentation. Evans-Pritchard was (is) an old-school investigative journalist, and he wanted to make sure he could back up everything he said. He names names, he records the circumstances of his interviews including the statements about underage girls, he lists references, identifies original documents, and it could save a lot of time for anyone who wants to get serious about studying Bill Clinton\'s hidden side.</p>',

            which reveals names of who and how CLINTON made his RISE. It also shows how the CIA was able to function outside of Law with the help of Billy Boy.  Which I imagine was the same playbook Obama used with F &amp; F. Also shows how well our Gov. plays "Pass THE Buck" on FOIA's

            Thank you --
           </p>
           <p>
            Imo, we have to begin to connect more of the dots which connect the CIA and the Clintons -
certainly to the drug and arms running in Mena, Ark where Bill Clinton as Government 
protected the project for the CIA.
           </p>
           <p>
            And to child sexual abuse and child trafficking where the CIA is deeply involved via MKULTRA.
           </p>
           <p>
            And while some may think that it is too nearly sympathetic to suggest that as children both
Bill and Hillary may have been subjects of the MKULTRA programming, I think that we have
to consider it.  Both families seem to have had involved with organized crime. 
And MKULTRA survivors have also show us that there has been a pattern of sexual abuse 
by fathers who then are benefitted by turning the child over to the CIA/MKULTRA program.
           </p>
           <p>
            As we look at Operation Mockingbird, Paperclip and Gladio we see preparations to move all
politics to the right, indeed by violent means when necessary.  It begins with the takeover of
our free press, moves 200,000 ex-Nazis into the US government by using them to found the
CIA, funneling them into the FBI and other government agencies.  And it establishes programs
to ensure that the right wing around the world (including the USA) will permanently hold power.
And, finally, bringing the fascism of the Fourth Reich to all of us.

            And by Roger Morris --
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Even Hillary Clinton was a Cold Warrior of sorts. Described in Morris's book as "a closet Contra supporter", she quietly aided Contra fund-raising in Little Rock. She also used her influence in US liberal circles to undercut the legitimacy of peace activists and pro-Sandinista church groups opposed to President Reagan's policies in Central America. 
The point is not that Bill and Hillary Clinton are Right-wingers in disguise - although Morris demolishes the pretence that they were progressive reformers in Arkansas. It is that they have no conviction, no ideology, no guiding purpose. Driven by raw ambition, they will make any compromise necessary to advance their interests.
            </p>
            <p>
             Student Bill Clinton 'spied' on Americans abroad for CIA
            </p>
            <p>
             Morris violates all the taboos. Impatient with the manicured myth that Bill Clinton was the apple-pie boy from Hope, Arkansas, he reveals the little-known fact that the President spent much of his childhood in Hot Springs, the capital of gambling, drug-smuggling and organised crime in the central United States, where his powerful uncle and mentor, Raymond Clinton, was a member of the Dixie mafia. 
It was not Mr Clinton's fault, of course, that he grew up in the culture of "the Mob". But it is central to understanding who Bill Clinton really is. It helps explain why his brother, Roger, ended up as a convicted drug dealer, and why Bill himself allegedly became a regular user of cocaine. (On a police surveillance videotape quoted from in the book, Roger can be heard saying to a supplier of cocaine: "Got to get some for my brother. He's got a nose like a vacuum cleaner.") 
For Morris, ensconced in his New Mexico mountain retreat, the American political system is now fatally corrupted. Democrats and Republicans noisily dispute how many angels can fit on the head of a pin. But both are indentured servants of the permanent government - "a bureaucracy so self-corrupted it is unfit for democracy" - and the interlocking interests of the lobby machine to be found on Washington's K Street.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now Dr Roger Morris, author of an astonishing new book called Partners in Power, claims that, in the late 1960s, Mr Clinton worked as a source for the Central Intelligence Agency. So, was the young Clinton a patriot or just an opportunist? He was certainly no dangerous radical. "No attack by his reactionary opponents would be more undeserved than the charge that young Bill Clinton was 'radical'," concludes Morris. 
According to the book, the bearded, dishevelled Rhodes scholar was recruited by the CIA while at Oxford - along with several other young Americans with political aspirations - to keep tabs on fellow students involved in protest activities against the Vietnam War. Morris says that the young Clinton indulged in some low-level spying in Norway in 1969, visiting the Oslo Peace Institute and submitting a CIA informant's report on American peace activists who had taken refuge in Scandinavia to avoid the draft. "An officer in the CIA station in Stockholm confirmed that," said Morris. 
The Washington Establishment would like to dismiss this troubling book as the work of a fevered conspiracy theorist. But Morris is no lightweight. He worked at the White House in both the Johnson and Nixon administrations, resigning from the National Security Council in 1970 in protest over the US invasion of Cambodia. He went on to become an acclaimed biographer of Richard Nixon.

            There's also this odd story by a former girlfriend of Bill Clinton's with a very odd 
description of her having met Hillary Clinton and her very odd condition . . .

             Thank you for that reminder. Yes, I had forgotten that it was well known back in the day, that Bill Clinton was a CIA asset while at Oxford University.
            </p>
            <p>
             And of course, the CIA even has a training manual on how to use sexual blackmail, including pedophilia, to get control of politicians and other useful dupes.

             Clinton was a very heavy coke user.  Saw it in the documentary The Clinton Chronicles.. His heart would have suffered for sure. 
I only had a couple of big nights on Charlie and never again.. My heart raced like crazy.
