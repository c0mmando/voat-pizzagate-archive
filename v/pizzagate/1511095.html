<h2><strong>#Pizzagate</strong></h2>
<p>If we will not forgive &amp; forget this needs consistency &amp; repetition, brand it into to common consciousness as it will always be the first name of this movement. To date there have been no alternative explanations offered for the Pizza code and more Pizza/CP references are found as the investigation continues. On a symbolic note: like Pizza, #Pizzagate is about a common widespread phenomena and the research into the entire Pizza value chain that make Pizza/child abuse possible. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Anything related #Pizzagate</em></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>#FakeNews?</strong></h2>
<p>People are curious after being warned by MSM and it’s still unclear as to who decides what is fake and why? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKFTQsgUVMg">RT questions integrity of third-party fact checkers</a>  Besides we don’t have proof we have questions. Questioning if Pizzagate is #FakeNews?: Triggers the public to find out what is fake; Forces (journalistic) participation in the research which could either helps us find answers or give insight as to who is avoiding/debunking without details; And questioning could not be censored as asking isn’t making claims or spreading rumours, it’s asking!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Anything proven or unproven. ...is this #FakeNews?</em></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>#CommonPedo</strong></h2>
<p>A name for the network of people involved in Child Abuse. Can be used to define and raise awareness about the size and presence of the Pedo network. It emphasizes both the: ‘normality’ of peadophillia, the brotherhood/secret society involved; and a wordplay on Come On Pedo! as a pledge to get perpetrators out of the closet.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>example of historical Pedo cases.. So much #CommonPedo everywhere</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>examples of cover ups. Who is protecting him? maybe #CommonPedo?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Another child abuser! Part of the #CommonPedo group</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>CommOnPedo! Stop denying, admit you’re a piece of shit!</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>#Children2Satan</strong></h2>
<p>Satanism endorses rape, torture and child abuse. A lot of people associate Satan with the evil in this world, or are not aware that this pure evil exists. Can be used to express anger and/or disbelief about the faith of children and questions the motive of child abuse</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Cults &amp; paedophilles a match made in hell #Children2Satan</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Who abuses our kids? #Children2Satan</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Lives are being destroyed and for what? Children2Satan?</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>#TheBigCoverUp</strong></h2>
<p>Expresses that cover ups for Pedo’s are part of a trend which happened before and is happening now. It’s also suggestive that things are covered up which could make people want to find out what is being covered up.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Another a Pedo gets off easy! #TheBigCoverUp</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Why isn’t this being investigated? #TheBigCoverUp</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Why can’t we talk about #PizzaGate, #TheBigCoverUp?</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>#CanTheyGetAwayWithThisAgain?</strong> <em>Wish I knew something shorter</em></h2>
<p>Expresses the need for attention to the subject NOW and stresses the fact that if we do not act now, they might be able to get away with this again. Use when defining signs of censorship, cover-ups and lack of (journalistic) investigation. Also expresses the lack justice in historical paedo cases with very few or low convictions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>No coverage on this by the MSM #CanTheyGetAwayWithThisAgain?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Another Pizzagate article censored #CanTheyGetAwayWithThisAgain?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Project Flicker 5000 names, 67 convictions #CanTheyGetAwayWithThisAgain?</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>#StillQuiet</strong></h2>
<p>Focusses on the many questions/links left unanswered/unexplained and the MSM blackout. Also could be use to emphasize that we are a non violent movement who do not enter Pizza shops with guns.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Megyn Kelly, why didn’t you ask …? …#StillQuiet</em></p>

            This meme focuses on the exposure of statism/humanism as an Illuminati/Luciferian construct. The purpose of the meme is disclose the nature of the underlying forces associated with commerce in the bodies and souls of men relating to the fall of Babylon (Rev 18:13). The meme shares the human trafficking elements and wider occult conspiracy themes of PizzaGate.

            This has me thinking more that pizzagate researchers have allowed themselves to get sidetracked by common intelligence agency tactics.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have branded pizzagate as "fake news" and even some very smart people working on this have fallen into the trap and try to "defend" pizzagate
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate IS NOT "News"
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate IS A CITIZENS INVESTIGATION OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.
           </p>
           <p>
            My thinking is it is critical to put it out everywhere to anyone that will listen.  This is a citizen investigation and NOT news.  This investigation IS newsworthy in some of the discoveries which have been found by private citizens that law enforcement and government agencies are willfully overlooking.

             Citizenship implies allegiance to the state, and it's the state which is the central operator in the global pedo network.

             <p>
              I am not a rebel against the U,S..  I am a defender of it.  Just like the citizens investigating pizzagate are loyal citizens of their countries fighring enemies of their state.
             </p>

              If you fall outside of that, the full weight of the state will be brought against you.  Remember that well because it is coming.

               You can't be both a loyal citizen to the state and part of a criminal investigate of that state, it's a conflict of interests. The paedo network is institutional, the failure of the UK and US goverment to address it should make that clear. Why else would Trump flip from "lock her up" to "we owe her a debt of gratitude"?
              </p>
              <p>
               Further, the state is in a process of collapse. The reason why is explained at the link.

If the current government has been hijacked by corrupt satanic pedophile shit scum, then they are enemies to my country whether they are in (and control) government or not.

                 The principles of the law of the land (aka the common law) include the privilege of making oath, which is the strongest expression of truth of in law. The law of the land belongs to the creator of the land, although it includes man-made laws it does not originate with man. Attempts to redefine the related language do not change this. The First Amendment, in conjunction with the assertion that the US Constitution is the law of the land, implies that bearing false witness against ones neighbour is lawful. In this case the devil  (the slanderer) is quite literally in the details. The tort of defamation considers only the harm to one's reputation, but the common law looks to the intent.

            I think some work needs to be done on branding the overall movement.
           </p>
           <p>
            Main case in point, I haven't bought a pizza since this whole story/investigation broke.  I finally did today.  And to be clear I am talking about literally pizza.  Cheese from cows, sauce from tomatoes and bread crust.  Knowing what I know now it's hard not to keep from it affecting you once in a while.
           </p>
           <p>
            Point is  pizzagate is a shock to the system many can't handle.  There needs to be other tags out there, some people have pizza night every week and I think they just don't want to have that last comfort in their mundane life destroyed.  I'm kind of a hardcore person so I would say  "sorry I ruined your comfort zone by pointing out the truth of innocent children getting raped murdered and possibly eaten, please go back and enjoy yout fucking pizza"  But that is not really good marketing is it?
           </p>
           <p>
            I think #SaveOurChildren is pretty good.  Who can be against that?  But I don't think it goes far enough to win.  Maybe for some here it is only about the children, human trafficking but for me it is about the global crime syndicate of which that is only a part of.

            Nobody speaks for all for us. We will not agree on everything, or even the basic strategies.

            This is a good thing. There is too much information to be contained in a single sub. You'd need a decent of subs but that doesn't really work. In reality this platform is just bad for research.

            There are tools to collaborate these types of investigations online, sort all the facts and sources, keep it legible, visualise it etc etc. But it seems whenever I mention these things I get down voted to bits as if I'm suggesting a migration or something. I'm getting fed up with the place and the mess it is becoming.

             What we are looking at here is a paradigm shift, there's not a lot of point in trying to organize the data until we understand how the pieces fit together in the wider context.
