<blockquote>
<p>INTRODUCTION<br />
In recent years, there has been widespread media attention given to the alleged “false
memory syndrome” (FMS), a term coined by the False Memory Syndrome Foundation
(FMSF) in America. The idea that a person could suddenly recall memories of being
sexually abused as a child has been presented as incredible and either evidence of the
suggestibility of women to other people’s ideas, bad therapy or even a deliberate
conspiracy between therapists and daughters to destroy previously happy families.1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something that stood out in particular is this part</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recent studies do not support the prevailing belief in the media and of FMS<br />
proponents that recovered memories of child sexual abuse “are fabricated by disturbed<br />
or vindictive adults or fostered by overzealous therapists”33 or that adults with<br />
recovered memories “<strong>are predominately highly educated females who have received<br />
psychotherapy as adults and who come from <em>well-educated, affluent families</em></strong>”34 who<br />
are highly suggestible to bad therapy or the influence of popular culture    
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reads like it is a CIA front for helping to track and cover up those who manage to get out of systematic sexual abuse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>well-educated, affluent families</strong></p>

<p>What are the goals of the FMS Foundation?</p>

             Do you have any reference to what that is? I am not aware of what that is right now.

             This is really weird to me because they set up a whole foundation for this and then they state that it is primarily for women from "well-educated, affluent families”. I read this and think, this is happening so much in these elite families that they set up a foundation for it, that is crazy!

             Even if this is not a front organization, it still reads to me like it would point to something related to victims of pizzagate.

              Bro throughout the 80s there were sra stories at daycares and now you read of the decade of satanic hysteria as some sociohidtoric phenomenon whereby a nation was duped by overzealous child psychologists who manipulated children to make false statements

               Not true. FMSF was funded by the CIA and they are always called in on pedophile cases to dismiss their claims. They are the bad guys

                I said you read of meaning even conservatives dismiss the whole thing casually, I havent  researched it much but I read the parents had to commission a surveyor who verified details of the tunnels like where u had to duck or turn
