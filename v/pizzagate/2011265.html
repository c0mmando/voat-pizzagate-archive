            <strong>
             KERRY CASSIDY/SCIENTOLOGY FRONT
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Click the link and read this whole article. The evidence is overwhelming, coming out of the latest Camelot interview with a Scientology "whistleblower".
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://nwocollapse.freehostia.com/article.php?ID=373">
             http://nwocollapse.freehostia.com/article.php?ID=373
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            For a while now, I have suspected Project Camelot to be a Scientology front. Why?
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              They will often put out 3 or 4-hour videos, in which almost nothing is actually said, and the content of the video can be summarised in 5 minutes. Yet, the guest will go on and on, leaving you in suspense, just watching the thing and wasting your time. This is much like the Scientology exercises in which you will sit and stare at a mirror for hours at a time.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Scientology has quite the association with Hollywood, as does Kerry Cassidy, co-creator of Project Camelot. She is a "failed" Hollywood producer who started Camelot as a way to "get back" at Hollywood with her own independent media outlet to reach people, in her own words. The logo for Camelot, the jaguar, is a spin-off of the MGM Lion, says Cassidy. I suspect that she is more a representative of Scientology, exploiting vulnerable conspiracy-tinted people. Indeed, her site is full of unsubstantiated claims about aliens, UFOs, free energy technology, a boy who claims to be from Mars. This is the kind of stuff you would see in a Hollywood movie, but it's presented as real.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Fans of the work are often desperate and urging to see the next released video. It is all they have in their lives, and so, they become dependent on Camelot, which does ask for donations and other financial support. In many ways, it is like the church of Scientology.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            You may look at these 3 points and think these are vague things to say, and on their own they are. However, on December 11, Camelot released its latest "whistleblower" interview, this time by a man under the pseudonym of Dane Tops, who is supposed to be exposing "black operations" within the Church of Scientology.
