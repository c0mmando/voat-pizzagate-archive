Has he sold others?  I don\'t trust this guy.  I hope LE has checked to see if he had others whose births were not recorded.  The Turpins had 13 children and I discovered another woman that was held in Cali 20 yrs ago by a man with 13 children as well.  I am wondering if these people somehow get or have these kids so they can profit by selling them off.  God This Is So Disgusting.   NOW Read This.  When Marks was arrested, authorities questioned his own parents, Davy and Dorothy Marks, who both said they hadn’t seen the child in four months. During their interviews, Mark’s mother allegedly phoned her grandson, Miller Marks, at his home, where the child was being held to warn him.  SO the grandmother calls her own grandson, to warn him since he is holding the girl.  WHAT?  The grandparents are OK with this.  Criminals Breeding Criminals. Ugh.</p>',
