Hotdogs and Pizza known to be pedo code for children to rape and sodomize. Subject: RE: Get ready for &quot;Chicago Hot Dog Friday&quot; <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/12/1223066_re-get-ready-for-chicago-hot-dog-friday-.html/">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/12/1223066_re-get-ready-for-chicago-hot-dog-friday-.html/</a>.</p>
<p>From the email: &quot;I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long ago, assume we are using the same channels?&quot;</p>
<p>Following this discovery Voat researchers discovered more background on Obama, known pre-election as a &quot;community organizer from Chicago&quot;, and was further linked to PG as he was also was pictured with &quot;friendship&quot; bracelets he shared with Joe Biden (also suspected to be a pedo), children sitting too comfortably his lap, the Alice and Wonderland themed halloween party, visits with James A on the White House logs. All of this discovery and more documented in <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a> history, archives, please search for reference/verification if this is new to you .</p>
<p>Now, intelligence tips from Q on <a href="https://8ch.net/cbts/res/">https://8ch.net/cbts/res/</a> 92197.html (broken link copy to address bar) brings Obama back to our attention with regard to to the future Obama Presidential Library in Chicago. First, before more on Obama, for those who don\'t know or doubt, a brief primer on Q Clearance Anon.</p>
<p>Q\'s (assumed to be Q Clearance military entity directly working with President Trump) stated purpose for intelligence drops is similar to our purpose here on <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a>: to inform researchers like us to discover and disclose (redpill) our friends and family of the inner workings of the elite to ease our loved ones reaction when the deep state are defeated and people find out the sickness that is at the core of the authority we once trusted. Q has acknowledged in his &quot;drops&quot; (see entire 8 chan CBTS thread catalogue) that the realization by the masses that a satanic cabal and all forms of corruption (drugs, trafficking, war, greed) would put 99% of Americans in the hospital. We understand this as we first felt this way when we learned of the Podesta emails, and viewed the JA and friends instragram pictures, and realized the deeply connected evil that was going on at the top of our government for ourselves. This is our joint mission to help others by reassuring our dear ones that God had this under His control, that people on the side of good have long known and have been fighting tirelessly for these things, and that through crowdsourcing, democracy is actually defeating evil on behalf of anyone still now suffering from SRA or other related abuses under the hands of others in this disgusting system, most especially vulnerable children.</p>
<p>The CBTS 8ch thread also plans to join with us here at Voat in the event that the thread at 8chan is under attack, and this notice is posted at the top of every new thread posted there, so we see that these boards really are the new form of discussion and connection on important issues, along with a sparse few media sources (Alex Jones, David Seaman, George Webb, Crowdsource the Truth etc etc) since the MSM has largely failed to bring the needed discourse and connection a free democracy should have from the 4th Estate (media) about important issues like corruption including Child Trafficking.</p>
<p>If we are passionate about the safety and security and freedoms of children or justice and good to win over evil, we must broaden our perspective not away from pizzgate, but view it through the lens of understanding, and thus defeating, the elite multi-faceted power structure needed to break this horrific evil. Q summarizes this easily with a picture that also has formed here on <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a>: a 3 sided pyramid of Saudi Arabia=main source of trafficking, Rothschilds=main source of funding, Soros=main source of fake news and propaganda. According to Q and other evidence in the news, Saudi Arabia has been neutralized, and we are somewhere in a 10 day struggle behind the scenes, to neutralize the Rothschilds and defeat Soros tactics. Refer to news about the realignment of the Saudi princes, the sealed 1000+ indictments, and &quot;Russiagate&quot; investigation starting to unravel reported in the MSM from Nov 2017 to present as basic evidence for this, though there is much much more. It is being reported that this corruption covers 1.2mm records that will be eventually disclosed to the public in some way, and this is our mission to keep others from harm and maintain peace through any ways we can help inform others of the truth. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/nov/15/ig-aims-finish-probe-comey-handling-clinton-spring/">https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/nov/15/ig-aims-finish-probe-comey-handling-clinton-spring/</a></p>
<p>With that background, my intent is to shine light on Obama and his library as Q is bringing it to our attention and the larger strategy to bring down the deep state cabal behind all of this is aided when we focus on making one realization at a time, and spreading awareness on each topic as we have done since the time of the election in 2016 when <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzgate">v/pizzgate</a> began. My concern with Obama\'s Presidential library is that is seems to have familiar patterns related to child trafficking, pedos, and other crime including enabling radicalization and the degeneration of Muslim beliefs about marriage of child brides leading to abuses . Looking at the articles below, could Obama be planning a new centralized hub of power to continue seeking more &quot;hotdogs and pizza delights&quot; in crime ridden Chicago, to possibly attract children with leisure activities, and provide a front for what he really seeks to do? This method would be similar to using ping pong games used at Comet Pizza and the basement of the Obama White House to attract children and then using the area, (like the Dupont Triangle complex in DC, the entire street CPP is on, and Pegasus Museum) to provide for the desires and appetites of politicians while under the premise of Presidential Library activities.</p>
<p>The articles below, among other unrelated details, speculate on the purpose of Obama\'s future library, questioning why the library seems to be constructed more for use for children to play than for what presidential libraries are actually for: a source of research and study of presidential service, access to records, and transparency. Obamas past connections with Clinton and her campaign chair Podesta, who both worked under Obama, are reason enough to consider what might be going on in these future plans for the sake of children, who are our future. Obama continues to be a controversial figure and elite middleman, along with other politicians, and we should give pause to reflect on his activities with others. Such activities may seek to threaten our free democracy by individual aspects of Obama and his cohort\'s strategy functioning to perpetuate child trafficking and pedophilia as a hidden foundational practice in the larger scheme of how illegitimate government influences play out on in the power struggle of good vs evil on national and international authority levels.</p>

<p>From Newsmax Article: Bolded by me where relevant</p>
<p>&quot;Once completed, the library will include <strong>a play garden for children, outdoor picnic space, basketball courts and a recording studio.</strong> It won\'t have all of the former president\'s documents, letters, and gifts he collected while in office, unlike most presidential libraries, which typically house the early drafts of speeches, legislation and correspondence that researchers and students can sift through.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the lack of personal materials, the library <strong>could still hold value</strong> for historians and researchers, according to the <strong>former head of construction and development for former President Bill Clinton\'s presidential library</strong>. Here\'s <strong>how it will be attractive: through the forums, workshops and programs they conduct</strong>,&quot; said James Rutherford, now dean of the William J. Clinton School of Public Service, to the Tribune. &quot;<strong>They can host conferences with administration officials</strong>, discussions on how Obama approached healthcare, <strong>how he developed the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) executive order</strong>. That\'s how the center will become a research institution.&quot; &quot;</p>
<p>Apparently this library won\'t house the usual records, it won\'t be under normal scrutiny or oversight, and according to the article title will be the &quot;Obama Library More for Children Than a Place for Scholars.&quot;!?!? What is this...are (((they))) serious? Please investigate.</p>',

            In sum: 1st half  =s Q's totes legit =s half the post. Really not much in the way of evidence for prescience, intent, reason to buy in to Q other than if you know you know. 2nd Half: Obama's library has a playground/park, the internet, and no hard copies (also I'm sure many records wont even make it to the soft, as far as the public's concern). All I'm saying is sometimes less is more, and also, with this Q thing, I mean, the only results I've seen so far is the failed run of a nut job judge from Alabama and the end of net neutrality. As my name is not Comcast or Cox, I'm not as impressed with his record as many seem to be here.

            I think you will really enjoy this. Some really good information in here. Being a time traveler means have access to The Family script. In other words if a person can see the future its not because they had a time machine its because they saw the future in advance by looking at the secret script of events to come. Remember the Trump time traveling stuff and Tesla? The book about Barron's adventures? Almost makes you think all this was planned along huh? Maybe it was bro, maybe so.

             As for the video, it was very interesting. Usually I don't pay attention to all that Simpson's stuff. I would find it much more damning if Trump actually
             <em>
              was
             </em>
             destroying the economic state of America, but it seems to be going well for you guys right now - unemployment at a new low for a long time, stock market setting record high. It's looking good. I'm wondering whether, if that part is inaccurate, if it was an attack on Trump rather than narrating the story.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for the rest of the "it didn't matter who won", again, very interesting. I do wonder, though, that if it doesn't matter, why are they still trying to impeach him and funding false sexual harassment claims? I guess time will tell what the outcome is on PG. Until then, I'll try and make sure that all of the Q stuff remains in CBTS unless it is objectively good for PG.

              Actually not true for the poor.  Plus more cuts for the poor on the agenda for next year.  Cutting safety nets, like healthcare for children, food subsistence, single mom's...supposedly to encourage ppl to work but you have to have jobs to work.  trump has increased H1B visas (foreign workers) and makes ample use of it at his properties.  The tax reform is a sweetheart deal for the rich, will screw the middle class and of course the poor.  All this while the military budget is increased to new heights.  Add to that the militarization of the police. deep cuts in school funding, affordable housing for the poor and cuts for the disabled.  trump is no different than previous potus...saying everything is great, numbers are down/it is all smoke and mirrors.  When you see the poverty around you, more hungry ppl standing on corners just asking for food (I see more now) it paints a different picture.  This country is declining, not advancing.

              Also not true, once someone has been unemployed for so long they are taken off the unemployment records/all the potus do it to make it seem like the numbers are going down but actually they are going up.

              This country has enough wealth to take care of the poor and disabled, make our education program one of the highest ranked instead of one of the lowest.  Instead the money is spent on the military industrial complex and wars of aggression.  Trump has increased troops on foreign lands.  The US is spending billions and trillions destroying lives and lands and dropping very expensive bombs might add.  Big pharma has a monopoly here/ppl can't even afford their medicines.  Vets were promised the best of care and yet liver flukes are killing viet nam vets and the VA is typically stalling.

              It is known where a lot of the babies and children are being trafficked, held for sacrifice.  All it would take is for some honest agents in any of the alphabet agencies to raid and free the children...but Q says we have to go slow/not freak ppl out.  Okay, sure, just let all those children who are FREAKING OUT IN CAGES carry the burden bc we don't want to freak out the main population.  Can you even imagine the horror those children and babies are going thru right now?  Waiting in cages, terrorized so their blood will have more adrenaline?

            Q clearance is Department of Energy (nuclear weapons) classification. I believe Q is a play on 9/11 where a Q classification would be required to see the info on the types of nukes used to vaporize the WTC site. 9/11 could have been the trigger for this soft coup group.

            Obama is such a devious creep.  He, and his minions are keeping”. ie. HIDING the records of all the Leaking that was done in to frame our President.  Judicial Watch submitted a FOIA request for release of the records, which we,as citizens , ARE ENTITLED TO.

            18 up votes on a thread about a library raided that is not open yet. That is an up vote brigade most likely.

            The message tells us that the public must be conditioned to accept the fact that there are pedos in the government so that it won't put 99% of the public in the hospital when they find out about it. In the meantime people are conditioned to the fact that pedos are in the government.
           </p>
           <p>
            This called normalizing the public to accept pedophilia and trust Freemasons.

             "Grounds for a house cleaning" oh fuck off, you do not own this sub and dictate the rules, its a community of people trying to bring awareness in to this issue, not your personal army of investigators. Its pretty clear that you have a bias against Trump and that makes you disregard posts/comments that show him in a positive light. And you seem to be okay with other anonymous sources that dont involve Trump. I've seen you attacking posts or comments about Trump time and time again without bringing anything new or concrete to the discussion which just proves my point, and I think I'm not the only one. Btw its not just about pedos, its about a worldwide satanic cult who are involved in cannibalism, mass murder, mind control, child sacrifices, organised crime and other shit that people couldnt even imagine in their worst fucking nightmares, done by people in our governments and probably every other element of our society thats supposed to work for the peoples benefit. Most of the normies will have a mental breakdown if and when this all comes to light.

              Could not be further from the truth. I would much rather have Trump than Hillary. I do not believe in Saviors. History says that politicians, all, in stealth accomplish the opposite of what they claim to achieve. If I set my expectations accordingly my downside risk is 100% covered because I expected them to screw us in stealth the whole time. If they should deliver anything at all above that mark it becomes a slow incremental benefit. If they should by some miracle actually deliver on their promises then it is a bonus. I do not calibrate my expectations and lifestyle in the HOPE that a politician will deliver. Cognitive dissonace kills insight. Blindly following a savior makes a follower blind. Smoking Hopium clouds judgment. I refuse to partake in any of these.

                This is a sub with rules that are not rules. Posts in which people attempt to tie sexual abuse to pizzagate, even though they might not be legit related to pizzagate, at least attempt to stay within the rules and on theme. These posts are often deleted.

                Its like I said earlier, If they would pull the pearls out of this Q stuff and bring it here instead of coming in here and saying "Q said" then maybe we would have something to work with. Right now its a rumor factory. It hurts our credibility and causes people to say "pizzagaters are crazy and unreliable." So yes I see it as a total loss for us. Not to mention that the Republicans are the AIPAC logistics and support team and we have to look no further than Jerusalem being given to Zionist kingpin Isreael and the people of Yemen being starved. This whole "storm" is causing some people be blinded and trust these Freemasons and Jesuits which is the opposite of all truth movement foundations. There is method in my thought process.

                Don't want anybody banned. Our mod is turning this sub into a bullshit and disinfo factory. People come here looking for legit info that is produced by a set of rules that are not rules. It is destructive to the sub and the truth movement.

                 But you do want to shut down posts or conversations by other people. Just because YOU think its disinfo or bullshit, doesnt make it so. Hell, you could apply that logic to most of the posts here. If we were to go on just evidence alone there wouldnt be but a handful posts here. And btw nice cherry picking on the Q's info there, didnt include things he clearly predicted such as the Saudi-Arabia arrests, Moores election results etc.

                  Not fascinated by it and not convinced he did either of these. These things were not difficult to see coming. Saudia Arabia has been a patsy for the U.S. banks since they were coerced into buying Treasuries in the 70's through a Rockefeller bank. Saudi has been used as a staging platform and logistics hub for Middle East destabilization of the Middle East so that the Middle East could be stripped of it's resources. Saudi was always slated to be the last in the chain to be compromised and dominated by the West as they became less useful. That time is now. Saudi is being forced to play a more dangerous role in the Middle East. They want Saudi to destabilize Yemen and Iran so that Iran's bank can be captured. Q totally and completely missed the mark on what is happening in Saudi anyway. Q defined the Saudi regime change as "the third leg of a global triangle" being knocked out for the first time in history. That one HUGE error tells me that Q is an amateur because nobody in the Trump administration is naive enough to believe that or is a disinfo agent.

                  No. Pizzagate is an elite unit of decentralized pedophile hunters not a political cheerleading club. There are hundreds of political based forums and subs. Cheerleading for Freemason Zionists is the opposite of pizzagate because those people are involved in child trafficking.

                  will become a source of pollution to the truth industry if it is allowed to stray from it's specialty. We are the largest crowd sourced, decentralized, unable to to be co-opted pedophile hunting group on the planet right now.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Nothing will be more destructive to pizzagate than teaching newcomers to trust Freemasonic Zionist child traffickers. The movement will morph into a political cheerleading club in 2018 if things do not change.

                 <p>
                  People need to cheer and support their favorite Freemason Zionists in subs for politics where there are other people that do not realize they are being duped by Freemason Zionists pretending to be fighting the deep state. Hell, they are the deep state.

                   What are you even talking about? Have you read all the Q posts? Because this post just proves to me you havent even read them besides the recent ones. "Pizzagate is an elite unit of decentralized pedophile hunters" no its not lol, what are you 12, or just delusional? How is this or Q posts political cheerleading? So youre saying you predicted the weekend that Saudi arrests were coming and the Moore election results in details? Quoting another Voater here who commented this to you:

                  <p>
                   1) Predicting the LORD's prayer would be changed by the Pope a week in advance
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   2) Predicting that Roy Moore would somehow drop a massive lead to then lose by an incredible margin when there was no evidence for that
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   3) Predicting the failed NY terrorist attack, including the nationality of the perpetrator.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Also, mentioning the white rabbit and then revealing a major lead with Heffner was very valuable to the investigation as a whole.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Explain those please.

After you read it watch this video and you can learn about the true meaning of Trump being a "time traveler" and why the book about Barron's great adventures was written. You will love this video, I guarantee it. Make sure you read the rest of the comment though because if you stick with me and ask me questions I will teach you some really cool stuff along the way in the coming months bro...

                    Most of us have known about Hefner for decades. Its cool that Q taught other people about the rabbit. That was good. The white rabbit is uqiquitous in Freemasonic lore and the rabbit is the rabbit burrow dweller that knows the where all the rabbit tunnels and rabbit holes are. If you follow the white rabbit he will lead you to a never ending list of Freemasonic related subjects and places.

                    This represents the Hegelian Dialectic. Duality. The Masonic checkerboard. Opposites. Two conflicting forces with Freemasonry controlling both sides. Playing protagonist and antoganist. In so doing they control the entire conflict and its followers. They fund both sides of every war and win by sinking both countries in debt.

                    Could not be further from the truth. I would much rather have Trump than Hillary. I do not believe in Saviors. History says that politicians, all, in stealth accomplish the opposite of what they claim to achieve. If I set my expectations accordingly my downside risk is 100% covered because I expected them to screw us in stealth the whole time.

                    If they should deliver anything at all above that mark it becomes a slow incremental benefit. If they should by some miracle actually deliver on their promises then it is a bonus. I do not calibrate my expectations and lifestyle in the HOPE that a politician will deliver. Cognitive dissonace kills insight. Blindly following a savior makes a follower blind. Smoking Hopium clouds judgment. I refuse to partake in any of these.

                    In so doing my expectation accuracy rate is well above 90% because politics is a con game of opposites. While some people are chasing carrots and sticks I carefully observe the man holding the stick. Most of the people that think I am a shill blindly follow Trump, which means I am on the right side of the expectations con game. If the herd agreed with me I would automatically at least consider reversing my expectations so that the herd did not agree with me.

                    Cool. Q still ain't my prophet. Should not be yours either. Freemasons plan in decades and centuries. Never know which tunnel you will ultimately get lead down. It won't be in your best intrest in the long run though. You can bet on that.

                     Thats not proof. And now youre just ignoring most of my points with the same copy-paste you've used several times in this thread. Again, prove it that Trump is a Mason. You cant, which just pretty much confirms your anti-Trump bias since you keep insisting that he is a Mason without proof or other context besides a few hand gestures. Those hand gestures prove nothing. You can lecture to me about Hegelian dialectic and freemasons duality beliefs all you want but that doesnt change the fact that you seem to have a big hate boner towards Trump and republicans in general. Anyone who takes a quick look at your submissions and comments can see that.

                       I watched it earlier and must have missed something because there wasnt any PROOF either. So wheres the proof? You seem to have a double standard when it comes to Trump because you dismiss Q anon as bullshit or controlled opposition but believe Trump is a freemason without any proof.

                        This is about matching patterns and to match patterns you have to be exposed to them first or the similarities cannot be noticed. What I can teach you cannot be taught in minutes. This is pattern matching and the subject material is strange.

                        I promise you that is not true. Years ago I was right where you are. I had nobody to teach me anything. If you get a calculator out and do a quick figure you will come up with with some incredible numbers.

                       <p>
                        For 15 years, 16 hours a day, I have been studying these exact subjects. I have a 114 gygabyte library of a lot of the things I have studied. 15 x 365 = 5475 days. 5475 days x 16 hours a day = 87, 600 hours.

                       <p>
                        I cannot teach you these types of things in two minutes because this subject is an "onion" and has layers. What I do now full time is teach. If you want to learn, and get light years ahead, learn cool stuff, I will teach you so that you don't have stumble around like most people and waste your time. Its up to you bro.

                         Right. So no proof. Gotcha. You're just a hypocrite then. Wow, do you have any idea how arrogant you sound right now? You have nothing to teach me, bro. Maybe someone should teach you about confirmation bias and modesty.

              Some anonymous dude told you a raid happened on a library.   The library is not built yet.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yet for some reason, you try to find a way to justify this claim?  Why?   Why are you holding on to a prior belief when evidence tells you it's false?
             </p>
             <p>
              Absolutely nothing in the link you give indicates the library is open.   All it indicates is that there's a plan for an Obama Presidential Library.  There no debate about that and everyone agrees it's happening.
             </p>
             <p>
              You also missed this part
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The early shipments are materials the National Archives is holding under a "courtesy storage" arrangement. Technically, the archives won't have legal custody of the material until 12:01 p.m. on Jan. 20 when the new president is sworn in.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              These documents are being held by the National Archives just as they should be.  What was going on in 2016 is the National Archives accepted storage of files early.   The files will then be sorted through by National Archives employees.  The building in your article is rented by the US government on behalf of the National Archives, not the Obama Library.  And your article is out of date, all those documents became under the possession of the National Archive upon Obama leaving office.  The archives own the document right now.
             </p>
             <p>
              First step.  Obama Administration documents moved to NARA under courtesy agreement.  Second step, these documents become NARA documents and the Archives have legal custody.

                Its like I said earlier, If they would pull the pearls out of this Q stuff and bring it here instead of coming in here and saying "Q said" then maybe we would have something to work with. Right now its a rumor factory.

                  The difference between me and you is that you see what you want to see, and I see what is. I don't have a savior hero model i'm willing to fall for like Trump or any other politician. Cognitive dissonance kills insight. Smoking Hopium feels great but it sux for judgement. Blind hero worship blinds the worshiper. You smoke your Hopium and then fuck off blind man, stay the fuck away from me if you are going to be a cognitive dissonance cry baby when someone does not worship your hero.

                 No, they're not, and that is frustrating. Yes, Q could be a complete hoax, or worse yet a psyop to distract. But then I consider that in order to bring all these people down, they would need to be arrested en masse in a huge operation or it could spin way out of control really fast. So that would take time to indict everyone with sealed indictments, and organize the sting with only a very few completely trusted actors. Very tricky indeed.

                 But as we move on, more and more are being awakened to the reality of these people. Is there an organized move going on against them? Time will tell. But it seems like something new is breaking that reveals the darkness every day now, which is encouraging.

            I'm sitting in a thread about a raided library that is a set of blueprints. I guess they raided the blueprints looking for hidden children. The mods pushed this whole larp on us from the beginning. The Golden Rule of the truth community is not to trust Freemasons in the government.

            </p>
            <p>
             1) Predicting the LORD's prayer would be changed by the Pope a week in advance
            </p>
            <p>
             2) Predicting that Roy Moore would somehow drop a massive lead to then lose by an incredible margin when there was no evidence for that
            </p>
            <p>
             3) Predicting the failed NY terrorist attack, including the nationality of the perpetrator.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, mentioning the white rabbit and then revealing a major lead with Heffner was very valuable to the investigation as a whole.

             Okay, so maybe we should move these sorts of posts to the CBTS subverse, and that's fine with me, but it's killing me to see you get this so wrong after many months of great posting - are you not wondering why all of the &lt; 1 month accounts are agreeing with you but all of the veterans disagree?

Then when  Q came I asked my couch what PG-related symbol a white rabbit could represent and it said "the most famous porn rag of all time you idiot."

                No such thing as racism has ever existed, it is a Jew fabrication.  I've heard that in the OLD SOUTH all whites understood blacks were less intelligent and it was considered POOR TASTE to even mention it.  That's the OPPOSITE of "hating someone for their skin color."

                I don't give a shit about their religion any more than the religion of Papuans.  It's the PREDATORY ACTIONS OF ETHNIC JEWS.  Do you understand usury is THEIR THING ALONE, SINCE FOREVER?  Would you try to make money off money, from the only people desperately poor enough to need a loan?  Me either

                  Public policy however demands looking at groups as a whole for their tendencies: stopping a young black man in a sports car isn't racist because they almost never make that kind of money and they steal a lot.

                  genuinely think they're doing good deeds.  They're wrong though and it affects us -- for example by forcibly populating white areas with crime-prone blacks everywhere whites flee to.  It's not our fault they are uberliberal or have a persecution complex.  Because of their actions they should GTFO.

                  Ideally we soberly recognize tendencies and work to alleviate them AND THE GROUPS SELF-POLICE.  You don't just invite a ton of Somali refugees, let em build communities, then when a member massacres a campus not expect even an apology from the "COMMUNITY." Every member needs to have the deterrent in mind that his whole family will be deported, his tribe shamed, his name cursed by the rest, etc.  Instead we apologize to the family like the Bangladeshi's JEW lawyer demanded.  You think a warlord culture is gonna respect that reaction?

              I don't fucking agree with mods pushing this on a sub of pedo hunters one bit. Who the fuck believes its good to normalize the public to the fact that pedos are in the government to keep the public from getting their feelings hurt? That has been the message the whole time.

               It isn't normailising it - it is just introducing it to them steadily enough so that they don't realise they are being fed the "conspiracy theory" that all their favourite fake news outlets warned them about. Look at the evidence I just provided you and see that it is essentially
               <em>
                impossible
               </em>
               for someone to accurately predict the future as often as this, and that they are pushing a man who is on the other side to these pedo elite freaks.

Just take a look at what is in front of you right now - I don't think it could be any clearer.

                I knew Trump was Mason long before he got elected. I'm proud to have Trump instead of HIllary, believe it or not. And honestly its not "Trump" that I don't trust, it is the Republican party full of Freemasons I do not trust. Trump is not in control of our government, Trump is controlled BY our government. Trump has less power than people might imagine. I'm much happier with Trump than HIllary.

                  Ok I will look at it. If it convinces me that a pedophile bust is being slow walked because it is necessary to keep from shocking the public I will be greatly surprised.

                It does not take a genius to recognize the fact that our government does not slowly condition us to the fact that there is a pedophile problem that needs to be handled. Anybody that believes our government would, or should, condition us to the fact that pedophiles exist before they arrest and jail the pedos needs to rinse out their common sense every now and then.
               </p>
               <p>
                The only time our government conditions us is when they feed us full of bullshit. If they actually arrest a government full of pedos we don't need our feelings protected for a year before it happens. I swear to God that one aspect of this whole thing is so creepy crazy that anybody that believes it needs their head examined.

                 Again with the misquoting/misinterpreting. I'm not talking about protecting the sanity/feelings of the public. If they realise that they're being sold PizzaGate straight away, they will switch right off and ignore us.

                  What do you not understand? We know our job. Our job is to redpill the public because our government refuses to bust pedophiles.

                  The message coming from the Q camp has been that the government is going slow so they don't shock the public when the pedos are finally arrested. If you take that seriously then I can't put much weight on your words either. This ain't rocket science.

                    If they would bring the pearls in here for us to investigate instead of coming in here saying "Q said" all this disinfo would not happen. I helped the Q gang yesterday by finding something related to the 7.8 million figure on the organ harvesting situation, so I'm not opposed to helping them find info on good leads. But posting everything "Q says" is probably not a good idea.

                   <p>
                    My main concern is that it is causing people to partner with (mentally speaking) with Freemasonic influences in our government because Q is supposed to be from the government. All truthers know that trusting Freemasons is not a happening thing to do.

                   So you're refusing to even
                   <em>
                    consider
                   </em>
                   it based on the fact that it is such an absurd idea? What, then, makes you better than the PizzaGate deniers? There is evidence behind what I'm saying and you won't even take a peek. Instead, you choose to preach what
                   <em>
                    you
                   </em>
                   deem the truth. How am I supposed to agree with you if you don't refute what I consider the damning evidence? It just won't happen.

                    Ivanka Trump was a 13-yo model under a known pedophile friend of Trump's and dated Nat Rothschild.  And you're calling someone else biased? GTFO

                     This sort of evidence is more like it. Unless you can prove that Trump pushed her into modelling like that, I'm not particularly concerned.

                     Also, I can't find any sources on the Ivanka dating a Rothschild thing apart from someone talking about a reddit post, and we both know how reliable reddit is. Link me something credible and then we'll talk about it.

                       Two very valuable links hidden amongst the rest of the shite. However, these seems to be anomalies, and I think they could be explained by

                        this hypothesis
                       </a>
                       , considering how much weight I put behind the other 4 points that I made - 5 if you include the other one I didn't copy over about the white rabbit, even though your response was trash.

                      <p>
                       I did you the courtesy of reading what you had to say, now read my own post and answer my questions and then we can be on the same level. Until then...

                      <p>
                       Also, I think you mean controlled opposition rather than gatekeeper. Gatekeeper is often used for people holding the gates of prison open for the pedo elite to walk into.

                         Phew, it's like you're trying to give me cancer just by looking at that. How about this to piss you off: The Holocaust wasn't a hoax - half of my ancestors on my father's side were killed in it (worked to death, I know there may not be evidence for gas chambers.) I'm literally only writing this to piss you off, but it's true nonetheless.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Countries that don't allow women's rights or cinema are some of the least developed in the world - there is direct correlation between womens rights and wellbeing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Also Q isn't a shill. It is impossible to predict the future as much as he has, and he is causing people to be red pilled at an alarming rate whilst also helping the investigation tenfold over and over.

                              The idea that this will be solved by arrests is unacceptable.  The Jewish elite and frankly the rest need to be physically removed from positions of power if not the North American landmass.  That will be on people's minds when shit is South Africa status bad.  The jew elite would prefer later rather than sooner because we still have gun rights and every year our numbers slip further (thanks to kike feminism). THEY STAGE WARS FOR LESS

                    If we are talking about our government dragging out a pedophile bust for a long period of time so that the public is not shocked by the information, then yes, I consider that an implausible theory, to say the least.

            The slower the reveal, the more children will be abused.  They are the helpless ones, and society needs to protect them from this evil.  We have already been much too slow.

             Where is the logic in this? It assumes that they know where kids are being held and just letting them sit there. It's much more likely that authorities would get the children out quietly; especially since they know the media is complicit.

              I mean, more children are being abused with each passing Satanic holiday.  Christmas Eve will soon be upon us, and I wonder how many will receive baby body parts as a gift.  That is all that I am saying.

              Maybe my comment was not clear.  I have received several negative responses.  The children are the helpless ones that need to be protected.  Do people think I meant the pedos?  LOL.  Come on...
             </p>
             <p>
              What I mean to say is that the Satanic/Luciferian pedos need to be taken down NOW.  If not, then more children will be screwed, ritually sacrificed, and cannibalized.

             Alex Jones is the perfect girl/boyfriend that does EVERYTHING right and is amazing.... but then every once in a while you catch them in a lie.  A stupid little lie that seems rather insignificant.  But then you can help but wonder "if they lied to me about something so small and stupid.... what else are they willing to lie to me about?"
            </p>
            <p>
             And for this I say... Alex,  I'm breaking up with you!

            The mod in the subverse is a joke. Where does it say in the rules that the mod can push any larp he chooses on the subverse? His ass needs to be fired.

            And I hate to break it to you, but all this "we must condition the public before we can bust the pedos (ourselves) in our government because we don't want to hurt your feelings when we arrest ourselves" is 100% undiluted industrial strength bullshit.

             Q has acknowledged in his "drops" (see entire 8 chan CBTS thread catalogue) that the realization by the masses that a satanic cabal and all forms of corruption (drugs, trafficking, war, greed) would put 99% of Americans in the hospital. We understand this as we first felt this way when we learned of the Podesta emails, and viewed the JA and friends instragram pictures, and realized the deeply connected evil that was going on at the top of our government for ourselves.

              I believe the Podestas are guilty child trafficking murderers. The only thing I agreed about was that all those people were not arrested. Other than that you are full of shit as usual.

               It's correct that you believed in many other nonsense conspiracies before the podesta emails, correct?   And that it's false that the podesta emails were "the first time you felt this way."

                Too funny. That is one of the reasons I keep saying that the Republicans probably cannot tear out this pedo ring. It is woven into D.C. culture. They send their children to prep school to be "prepared" by sodomy.

             Lol. I agree for the most part -- and there is a real danger that the slow-drip approach
             <em>
              weakens
             </em>
             the uninformed rather than strengthening them. It all becomes part of the "new normal" to which they give their implied, increasingly hopeless consent.
            </p>
            <p>
             My "for the most part" reservation is: given the unknown breadth of complicit and compromised people currently running the circus, it's difficult to imagine how to extract the criminals and still have anything like a functioning 'government.'
            </p>
            <p>
             NOT saying this is reason enough to not pull down the tents in order to protect the children. AM saying we need to be cognizant of the extent of the reset we're looking for.

              We are at about 2/10 right now.  If there is a massive scandal in the House as foretold, that will turn it up to 4.  Indictments of DOJ and FBI will make it 5.  And so on.  The storm is picking up speed.

              Your 99% may be a little conservative.  Look at the subscribers here vs the US population.  And PG transcends our borders pretty easily.  (Unless PG is strictly CPP-centric.  Which it isn't)

              Did you watch that video that explains the Cosmic Christ thing? You will like it. Its not rough like the last one. This guy is very religious and he does an outstanding job of explaining how the cabal co-opted Jesus.

                 Yeah.....think that shit head...I got an ar-15 loaded in my closet.  I was ready to riot this bitch last year.  But I have grown to understand that this is going to happen a different way.  We are only needed to put pressure on.  Wait a couple more weeks....then it will be time to strike.  Do you not understand the game yet?  The green frog?  The esoteric meaning behind the 25th of December?  These people have been planning to take down the Jew since the Korean War.  And they are going to do it in style because that is the damn plan.  Crying aint going to make them move any faster.

                  No why don't you explain the significance of Pepe and what kind of plan is 60 years in advance.  Christmas is Saturnalia banned by the original Americans now a (((capitalist))) scheme that lets companies operate on debt all year until enough bovine morons shop for Xmas.  Trump's kids are all married to Jews so are they getting gassed too or what

                    So Jesus died on the 21st &amp; was resurrected 3 days later , like the Egyptian star Sirrus rising 3 days after dipping below the hoizon on the 21st.Now isn't that  coincident.

             So John McCain and Hillary Clinton have ankle bracelet trackers  (As does Chelsea Clinton though, those photos are from years ago.)

             John Podesta is in Custody or Exile....I forget which.

             Tony Podesta is in Custody.

             The Obama Libary has been raided.
            </p>
            <p>
             I can figure out which of these is the stupidest claim.   This last one is right up there though.  ( I just remembered wasn't Obama in exile as well?)
            </p>
            <p>
             Let me walk you through why this is so stupid.
            </p>
            <p>
             First of all, you do realize that Obama was employed full time through Jan 19th of this year right?  At a job where when you leave you want to take a very long vacation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you think they planned, raised funds for and built his library all ready?
            </p>
            <p>
             This is the Obama library as of today.  This is the actual building.
            </p>

                Not so much.  You think the group behind this coup isnt aware of exactly what is the force behind everything?  Dude this is a avalanche racing down the mountain.  You can not slow the reveal after major arrest start happening....then the Normies will be forced to pay attention and millions are going to stumble onto what we have for the last year.  And they will figure it out soon enough.  I am confident that the vaccines, the lyme, the autism and the sperm count reductions will get the Pogrom started......it will take a while to build proper amounts of anger....but when it hits.   Look out.

                  It takes a lot of cognitive dissonance to overlook the fact that the Republican party is the AIPAC logistics and support team but some people find a way.

                 You're the one following the carrot instead of watching the man holding the stick. The Republican party is the AIPAC logistics and support team for the Zionist agenda which is marching forward at blinding speed. Look no further than Jerusalem being stripped from Palestine and Yemen being starved to death. How you can selectively miss these things is beyond me.

               Lame enough to up vote a thread about a library getting raided when a library is not even built and open for business. You comment on things you don't have a clue about. It is a habit of yours that I have noticed.

             What the white hats did was go to Hoffman Estates, which is a suburb of Chicago.  The documents were fast peddled out of WH when Hillary lost.  Remember Susan Rice and the unmasking debacle?  Judicial Watch used a FOIA to get those records and was told in possession of Barry’s new library.  You cannot get a copy for five yrs.  The problem is the library is not going to be finished until 2021.  I don’t think they have even broke ground.

             So POTUS gave orders to pick up these docs in Hoffman Estates. He has the right to get them by law. Only person with that authority to see.
            </p>
            <p>
             I figure about now they have read them and some indictments are a direct result of the same.

              This is completely untrue.

              The documents were delivered to the care of the National Archive EARLY.  And this was the plan way before Hillary or Trump had the nomination.   It had nothing to do with Judicial Watch.  The building was rented for the National Archive in February.  The National Archive is the legal owner of the documents.  The Obama Library falls under the National Archive.   The Archive already had some documents by May, 2016

               Technically, the National Archives doesn't take legal custody of Obama's documents until 12:01 p.m. Jan. 20, after the next commander in chief takes the oath.  But with an OK from the White House, the agency can begin shipping and organizing some materials well before that date, Laster said.......According to Laster, the agency already is providing "courtesy storage" for some of Obama's presidential papers
