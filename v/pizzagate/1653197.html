<p>A woman, who went by the online pseudonym &quot;Svali,&quot; describes growing up in a Satanic/Luciferian cult (I\'m ignorant on the theology) that &quot;trained&quot; each member from youth through the measured and repeated use of various sorts of trauma, including physical abuse to the point of near-death, rape, forced assault/murder, drugging, sensory deprivation, standard brainwashing, etc. She describes these practices in detail from a unique perspective: Her job was to administer this &quot;training&quot; of members. Her writing is totally consistent with the testimony/writing of others on the subject, including Cathy O\'Brien. </p>

<p>My primary motive to post this is that I\'ve seen so many people form hypotheses and make guesses about this child abuse we\'re hunting that are spot-on in the context of her writing.

This ought to be default, recommended reading for anyone interested in this thing we\'re calling &quot;pizzagate.&quot; If there was ever a time to bring Svali\'s work to mass awareness, it\'s now.</p>
