<p>This guy is a world class liar. I KNOW that personally. Slippery scumbag may you rot i n hell!!I am thrilled that he may be going down and I really question his pedo connections. 
&quot;Hahahaaha!! You little worm!! Of course you act so outraged!! Paul, hey you fuckhead, remember making up a lie about me, that I assaulted your niece at some party I did NOT want to go to but your sister begged me and then you spread the vicious lie!!?? Problem was, Kim was with me the whole time as was your sister\'s son Casey(well, a lot of the time he was with us).
All for what, to cover up the treatment for Due South being lifted from me? Huh, was that why or maybe because you and Lantos were involved with my ex wife Maybe both!
You pretty much destroyed my ability to find work after that innocuous lie.
So, I don\'t know if you raped this woman or not but I do know that you are a liar!!!!
Much of your side of this story sounds like one of your bad screenwriting efforts(not the good screenplays that others write and you take credit for). Lawyer asks for 9 million settlement money?? Come on, you aren\'t that important...anymore. 
And the bit about having a bad back, so you couldn\'t have assaulted her??? What??? That is almost an admission of guilt.
My Kim, here in your hometown, actually spend time visiting with you father who was dying, yet no funeral? No thank you from you?? I know lots about you buddy. Your ex wife lives here. Women have told me other things about you during Due South so is this accusation plausible? Yes!! But you being the bitch you are act so insulted! You had no problem trying to destroy my life. 
By the way, your daughter art is really good but her images are WAY too ritual abuse victim. The shattered glass, the naked covered in blood, that comes from somewhere.If nothing else I know you are a needle dick bug fucking liar. Hell your sister Kathy even wrote volumes bout how creepy and disgusting you were.Too bad she is dead now and her blog seems to have disappeared, at least what she wrote about you lying and thieving.
May you and a few others , rot in hell.</p>
<p>P.S. People, don\'t fall for the &quot;Scientology is trying to hurt me since I left the church&quot; BS. NO, see, I believe you used the Scientology goons as long as you could and then you had your chance with the CIA so you slid over there. The game,Call Of Duty is nothing but CIA recruiting. Now you probably work for them but they figured out you were worthless so ...hence, your head is in the guillotine&quot;</p>

            Also, for all the researchers out there, that Haggis really cut his teeth writing for TV shows that had mostly children in them.. Diff'rent Strokes,One Day At A Time,Facts Of Life, etc. His one daughter is a good artist but stuff   like her 'Through the Looking Glass'http://www.laurenhaggis.com/Oil.html#8, disturbing. None of this really menas anything other than what a dick and liar he was and can't put anything past him.His chrity in Haiti reeks of more of the same phony charity work and photo ops cause that is who he is, looking for the right image, the right photo op

            By the way, factfinder2 thank you for finding this. This is the archived blog his now deceased sister had written about him. I know I know, she was still in Scientology but there are some truths about him in there nonetheless.

            I guess you have to know him to understand his sociopath traits. He claims this lawsuit will hurt his chances to raise money for his charity....it is such bs in my opinion. Sappy sugar coated crap that he has been shilling his whole life. 
Oddly, the often-purple complaint also makes sure to note the blowback Haggis received when he left and criticized the Church of Scientology several years back as well as “Plaintiff’s extensive charitable efforts, which support thousands of children in impoverished communities.” Calling out a cultural environment of “public hanging” where “headlines pour down like rain every day with ‘explosive’ new claims and allegations of sexual misconduct and impropriety, particularly targeted at the Hollywood male ‘elite,’” the complaint goes on to say that “it is one thing to live in fear of losing one’s career, but quite another to bear the anxiety caused by the knowledge that Defendant’s threats could destroy Plaintiff’s ability to continue to effectively raise money for these children.”

            Paul Haggis has spoken out about the fraud of the Church of Scientology numerous times and publicly quit and rebuked the Church and its practices/hypocrisy.  Paul Haggis also included a story line about human trafficking in his Oscar award winning film "Crash".

            -- you might want to add the info from Factfinder2 to the main body of your post in case MF doesn't dig in far enough to see the evidence of underage involvemement.

             Just to be clear, Breest was not under age when the alleged Haggis rape took place.
            </p>
            <p>
             I only included the info about her as an interesting synchronicity with her connection to Child Mind Institute, which has been extensively discussed on Voat.  She was under age when hired by Hastert in 2002 for a very short run as a House page.
            </p>
            <p>
             I will note here and will also comment to the OP that Haggis has a very intense and long-term involvement, even pre earthquake, with helping children in Haiti.  That is just a point of information.  He may be doing God's work there, but any interaction with children in Haiti obviously needs to be scrutinized.

              Bud, I know Haggis and I seriously doubt he is doing any of it other than for a photo op. He was involved with the Budmans of Toronto and one of them was the godfather of my son. These people wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire. I understand when you don't know someone and you don't want to jump to conclusions but this isn't the case.My girlfriend was best friends with Joey

               Interesting information.  I do think there's much more to Haggis than meets the eye.  I'm putting up a separate post now his Haiti connections.
