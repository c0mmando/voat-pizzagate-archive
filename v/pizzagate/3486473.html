            Not going to comment on "frazzle-whatever" because I know nothing about it, really, and have never seen it.
           </p>
           <p>
            However -- it seems blatantly obvious that DeepState sources are pushing hard on the existence of 'DeepFakes' as a prep for when they do end up dropping --
            <strong>
             while also ignoring that similar computer technologies can look at DeepFakes "under the microscope" and detect the little glitches, blurs, whirs, and doo-dads that are the signiature of a faked video. Until we can simulate a reality, there really is no way to use CGI and NOT get these artifacts.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Obvious mental prep for blind-sheep followers that will balk at such material being submitted to a Grand Jury, because if it exists, it's never going to see the public domain. And why should it? Do you want to help glorify their actions and spread their reach, even under the pretense of absolute and unrelenting condemnation? Create a situation where Copycat SRA wannabies sprout up? Showing the videos publicly would be stomping on the victims' last moments, IMHO -- however the PUBLIC must be made aware that the videos are real and ensured (if true) that they
            <em>
             weren't
            </em>
            faked, have been vetted and verified by computer forensics experts with no political bias, the extent and frequency of the crimes committed, etc. The truth must be known, but a Satanist's high crimes must never be bandied about in a public atmosphere.... or they "win" their immortality through the notoriety such a public outing would bring.
           </p>
           <p>
            Could be a little off here, but I just don't see a public rollout happening.
           </p>
           <p>
            A) because there would be an overnight Revolution in the streets. (Most likely)
           </p>
           <p>
            B) because viewing such material outside a criminal prosecution would be, in fact, breaking the law. (Totally true. Just don't view it. Don't even peek it. Turn the BirdBox blinders on and you're along for the ride once the Show starts --
            <em>
             if
            </em>
            it starts.)
           </p>
           <p>
            C) because of the Notoriety/Immortality thing described above. (Least likely)

             Could you give me some references to this?- because I agree with you that once videos start dropping of them raping infants, they are going to use the 'muh deep fakes' execuse

            Been a few frazzle.rip threads on halfchan, anons still seem to have come up with nothing regarding the video. The very fact Erik Prince said he'd seen it confirms its existence for me.

            It was the Russians. It was MI6 and the totally fake (and stupid) Trump pee dossier. It was Comey. It was stupid Podesta. It was stupid Donna Brazile and CNN, who provided the secret questions for the debate but forgot to give me the secret answers. It was Chelsea and Merv who didn't crank out enough charming grandkids in time. (Did you know they charge me a fortune for photo ops with them? I wonder where she learned that — ha ha!).
           </p>
           <p>
            It was stupid Weiner and his 15 year-old bimbos. It was stupid Bill and his endless string of chubby bimbos. It was stupid Bill getting caught meeting with Loretta. It was Epstein and his 12 year old bimbos on the Lolita Express and Pedo Island. It was Comey and Prince Andy and whatever they were up to as furries or otherkin.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was Comet Ping Pong and their damn Instagram. It was the Founding Fathers (the muthas) who invented the Electoral College, It was my coven in the Chappaqua forest who messed up Latin and read the Bible forward, which put a blessing upon me and cancelled all I promised to His Majesty, King of the Bottomless Pit.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was rumors of FrazzleDrip. It was the Ukraine. Finally it was Orange Man Bad who failed to play his assigned role as the Republican wussie clown and didn't roll over and play dead. But it
            <strong>
             was not ME.

            They really say stupid shit. Stephen colbert said one time 'I thought there was gonna be pizza' in an anguished joking way. Immediately afterwards he said 'soylent green is people'... it was so out of place.. unless it was a call back, but it sounds like he's talking about occultist cannibalism, with the obvious pizza twist..

            Here's what I think Hillary is doing regarding the dark web comment and videos.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think she's prepping her followers with suggestive propaganda so that when the videos of her start spreading, they'll already be pre-programmed to believe the videos are faked using computer software. These deep state fuckers are well versed in the game of mind manipulating. People are so in the dark and that makes it very easy for them to convince people of just about anything they want. I've tested the power of suggestion myself in a few experiments. I stood in a grocery store near the milk isle pretending I'm talking on my phone. When someone was about to reach for some milk. I'd say, Into my phone. "No. I'm going to get milk somewhere else because their milk here is dated wrong. Every person over heard me and put the milk back. It's as easy as that. Just say it and most people act on it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hillary is an expert on mind fucking people.
           </p>
           <p>
            She is prepping for her big theatrical moment.

            So it's my understanding that the "right" people are in possession of the "raw" video. Why did NYPD officers vomit? Why are there so many now dead (by suicide) NYPD cops?

             Someone has it...this may be EXACTLY the kind of shit Q is referring too as far as breaking sheeple minds with too much info.  Trump won't be looked at as a hero if he were to put this video out, for example.  It won't come out until Hillary has absolutely nothing left to squeeze from her by the people who have it (likely Mossad via Epstein)

              If it's true that many of the electoral college members have high-ranking security clearance, then it's possible her elector from West Hollywood, Edward Buck does too. WHITE Ed Buck is the alleged, jailed torturer and murderer of poor BLACK men. Sort of a one-man West Hollywood branch of the KKK.

              I don't think so. Calling her voters a basket of deplorables was maybe not a good idea after all.

              Okay, I think I misunderstood what she was saying. She says no one has seen it, but they will. As in, the threat of people maybe seeing it. Not that we ever will. Like its being held over her head and out of voter's reach. It was a little unclear to me the angle she was taking.
