I would love to be wrong about this. But no one who sees all of the material believes it’s not happening. I believe Wikileaks revealed that John Podesta is involved with violent child abuse and pedophilia, along with many of his associates. Researchers believe they have uncovered not only coded emails, but actual videos  (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1776870">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1776870)connected</a>connected) to the recent claims about Wikileaks uncovering an elite peophile ring. So what is going on?

            I agree, and this is pretty much what I said myself yesterday in a group PM regarding the issue. I can't stand behind policing the sub, and I think enforcing the Voat User Agreement is the job of Voat ownership; we're mods, and our job is to enforce rules agreed on by our community.
           </p>
           <p>
            With that being said, while I will not support banning

            for violating the Voat User Agreement, I will support banning him for spamming if he keeps this copypaste vigilantism up. There's a difference between wanting to provide information for the citizen investigation, and aggressively pushing your own narrative.

             Just to make it crystal clear, since my main purpose here is archiving content, I will not have my comments removed, nor be banned, for providing archive/screenshot links to user deleted content?

            Using an archival bot account will not grant you special privileges in this sub, especially seeing how you use said bot account for slipping in your own normative opinions, essentially hijacking the unique visibility of your account and misusing community trust.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to ask you to refrain from using the bot for anything that's not the bot's business, and also from spamming the same information over and over again. If you can properly source it, post and discuss it once, and then move on. I do understand that you tried doing that and your submission was removed, however, it is my understanding that it was removed for insufficient sourcing as opposed to a violation of the Voat User Agreement. You received your warnings for violating the Voat User Agreement, this was, in my opinion, incorrect. You should have received the warnings for spamming.

             I don't pretend to understand the whole of this dispute, but Bot seems to provide a useful service for anyone who wants to deep mine a submission, providing related links - possibly the same as may be found from a search.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also the links are archived so "preserving history" although some folks might want bits to disappear.
            </p>
            <p>
             You might consider stepping back from what appears to be heavy handedness on a "free speech" site,  I myself frequently archive submission threads - usually to preserve any information there rather than particular comments that might later be deleted, but I have on one occasion that I recall done it to preserve someone's comment.  Comment deleted sets one wondering sometimes.

             That is fine, judging from the upvoats I received with those comments, if you gag me, then someone else will carry the torch. I can assure you this. Making sure that people are aware of the controversy behind an account that claims to be a 'researcher' is not spam. Feel free to link to this chain of comments each time I comment in this fashion, if it helps you sleep at night.

             In any case, my commentary under this account, aside from the dealings with psychanaut, are usually just me sharing a generic opinion to see how it resonates with the community. It usually resonates well so I continue to do it. I will continue to comment under any account I wish to use, including this one.

              Being cocky and not showing any sign of cooperation is not gonna get you very far. Rest assured, if you get banned, it will be because of repeated violation of subverse rules.

            If it's at that point, then they have you logged for being on this forum. By the way, I'd propose that sli.mg (and the other archive sites that the vast majority of researchers were using) were likely honeypots. Being in the open and putting everything out publicly is probably the best. If they want to get in your computer they'll get in it.

            Just to make it crystal clear, since my main purpose here is archiving content, I will not have my comments removed, nor be banned, for providing archive/screenshot links to user deleted content? Is this correct?

            Pro tip: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

            When a white guy agrees with you and offers you free advice garnered from a lifetime of fighting his fellow white man.......you might want to listen.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just a thought, no long term commitments or repetitive payments, I offer advice with nothing more than the heartfelt desire that the White Man is removed from power because if he doesn't leave he'll probably destroy all life on planet Earth.......but whatevs. Nothing ventured nothing gained. No skin off my back.

            I'm just an old guy with nothing to lose but an ever worsening case of Spinal Stenosis that just recently went into 2nd gear or as WebMD calls it:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.webmd.com/back-pain/guide/spinal-stenosis#1-3">
             Foot drop, the painful leg weakness causing you to “slap” your foot on the ground.
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It should go without saying I have neither the money nor the job security to have it surgically repaired which is only 50% effective anyway and with my luck surgery would probably leave me worse off. If I can just make it to the bathroom every morning I consider it a good day. So believe me it's no skin of my back that you insult me and refuse my advice. I've heard and dealt with much worse.

            So psychanaut keeps pushing MIT Media Lab articles by Kim Holleman, says things like 'fuck the executive summary' and then just posts copy pasta from the executive summary and pizzagate wiki.

             Going to need more clarification on this statement in the user agreement as anything a user deletes cannot be posted as a screenshot or an archived link to what they said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Example...if one of the mods/users wrote something like "yeah im a baby killing rapists whatcha gonna do about it?" then deleted the post any user who posted that message would be banned.

              Hi redditsuckz, the reason I left a detailed comment about the removal here in the thread where all can see, rather than just in the "Reason for Removal" box that shows up in the Removed Comments index, is for transparency and accountability.
             </p>
             <p>
              I will further elaborate to say that the comment that I removed was not only directly against the rules, it was very likely intended to censor Psychanaut. So one could argue this removal was an attempt to increase free speech.

              Going to need more clarification on what, exactly, happened here, and then what your argument is, because your example requires mods/users to be a really special kind of stupid that I doubt I'd see here.

               Psychanaut posted AMA telling everyone her identity while talking in the 3rd person(?) but the post was deleted by them and Pizzagatebot posted a screenshot of the deleted AMA then their comment was deleted and threatened with a ban ...you can see the comment in the removed comment section.

            "White race must be exterminated"
           </p>
           <p>
            After learning George H.W. Bush and the Clintons started the Crack epidemic to make money off of the suffering of poor black people I understand how you'd feel that way.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pro Tip: Saying you want to exterminate all white people kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind of allows people to dismiss anything that comes out of your mouth after that.
           </p>
           <p>
            The way to defeat white people is through non-violence and campaign finance reform so giant corporations can't run the show down in DC and invent God knows what like maybe Crack 2.0 to make even more money off the suffering of poor black people.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm on your side brother. I'm just saying since I'm a white man I kind of have a good idea about how to take the white man down.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just sayin'.
           </p>

            Jiminy Crickets you put the word Allah in your username then refer to Allah as God in your comment. Do you even know any Muslims? A Muslim would NEVER call Allah God. That's just about the most offensive thing you could say to a Muslim.
           </p>
           <p>
            A Muslim wouldn't accuse someone of being the Anti-Christ either. Islam believes the New Testament was perverted and anything it says about the Prophet Isa like how to define the Anti-Christ is disinformation.

            Just a thought. It's possible those in charge of censorship allow this video to stay up because they want to inflict trauma on all of us. It's traumatizing to hear and watch, and even more traumatizing to witness that absolutely nothing is being done about it. Meanwhile we're being told and shown that all of the agencies meant to protect us, as well as the sanctity of the law, have been deeply corrupted.

             Everyone should be critical of anyone who both claims to be a victim AND taking donations. We know that pizzagate is full of shills, so it is not unreasonable to be suspect.

             Haven't found anything about him being an actual photographer or videographer. In Seattle area, its common to find a legitimate photographers name somewhere like a portfolio or linkedin or something.

             I call them like I see them. It does stink and look at the clickbait title this no-name videographer made to try and get 50k from pizzagate community to  make a documentary for Becki because she had 'vetted him as a born again christian'. The guy didn't even have a portfolio to share, nor a breakdown of cost or any plans, NOTHING. Just putting hand out and asking for 50k -

              Another way to say this is that you think Becki Percy is lying about her experience as an SRA survivor, and you base this on her early Facebook posts about wanting to be famous when she grows up.

            I'm no fan of John Podesta. I even vaguely recall writing I couldn't decide who was more likely the Anti-Christ, John Podesta or George H.W. Bush. But where did you see smoking gun evidence he's a diddler in the Wikileaks emails?

            And while I'm at it why do you keep posting the same fucking WorldCorp videos over and over and over again? Someone who went to MIT is smarter than that. How about plowing a new field? Right now you've got DISINFO SHILL written in bold letters across your forehead.

             If those videos are real,  and I know from other posts that you don't believe they are, but if there is a chance, then it only makes sense to push for those of us still paying attention to report this video to the FBI until some action is taken. Yes, it takes a brilliant mind to become an MIT researcher, and her mind decided it isn't unreasonable to ask for an investigation based on the fact that there was a child crying out in agony. That alone was her gist. Now how in the world in that shilling? It's being a rational, intelligent and compassionate human being, IMO.

              Thank you V___Z. Really thank you. They have to be investigated in order to be either proven false or true. Never investigating them is not an option in my mind...eventually they will reach someone with either the right expertise or authority to do something about this.

             </p>
             <p>
              We've alerted the FBI several times. They are aware of this issue. I'm not sure why you think repeatedly alerting them to the same video is going to get different results. In fact if people keep alerting the FBI of the same video over and over and over again they'll eventually just tune us out.
             </p>
             <p>
              So actually my question is why do YOU think pestering the FBI is going to add credibility to your theory as opposed to damage it.
