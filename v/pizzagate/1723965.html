            Did you know there are people who consult with rich criminals before they get into jail to teach them how to survive prison and make it a country club atmosphere? I wouldn't be surprised if they pay off the judges to get them into easier prisons. I actually know a guy who does this. I found out he was consulting Michael Douglas and his son on how to make his sons experience less harmful in prison. He was flying to NY and Las Vegas to have dinner with them, and I guess, pull strings. He makes a fortune too. Another luxury regular people cannot afford. I was disgusted when I found out what he did for a living. It's kind of like that movie "Get Hard" with Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart, but on a white collar level.

            MY TRUE "encounter" with Jarred was on Valentines Day weekend 2011.  I take my ol' lady to Orlando for a weekend getaway (we're from nearby Cocoa Beach). I pull up to the Embassy Suites where we were booked. Parking was scarce, I dropped her off so she could check us in while I looked for a nearby parking space that was reasonably priced -- no easy task. Meantime, she checks us in and went to the "Courtyard Bar" for a complimentary adult beverage. Not to sound like a dousche' but my wife "cleans up" well -- blonde, was dressed up, skirt/heels the whole nine for Valentines. 20-25 minutes later I finally walk in a tad frustrated from taking so long to find parking. I finally find her at the bar with a guy yapping away to her along with his buddy. I'm not the jealous type, somewhat use to this scenario, like whenever I go use the head or leave her alone for a spell -- the vultures show up.  But, this time they continued to yap even after I arrived, only furthering my frustration!  They were apparently under the impression she was "available" but truth is my wife, a certified chef and just maybe certified crazy ;) could talk to a wall! I hardly took notice of who she was talking to, I just wanted my damn beer after a long, frustrating drive! Finally several minutes later when the opportunity finally arose after he took a breath from bragging, she whispers "that's Jared from Subway!" I peek over, sure as shit it's the formerly-fat Joo. I was eventually introduced though could give a rats ass -- I'm sure came off as such.
           </p>
           <p>
            Turns out they were in town for...I believe it was called The Jared Foundation? The "other" guy with Jared was his manager. They handed her his business card, said "call me, I'm in town for the weekend" and left not long after figuring out we were together (he apparently doesn't know what a wedding ring looks like?) He really came off as an arrogant, narcissistic dick and I just gave him a smirky stink-eye with a wink -- hardly worth getting my blood pressure boiling.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's pretty much it. You can imagine my "shock" when learning he was popped for being yet another Joo pedo. I'll have one tonight for my homies, and one for the inmate that gave Jarred the ol' one-two ;)

            This person also had pictures of CPP on his Flickr account.  He took it down, though.  He also had many upskirt pictures of Asian women.

            This is excellent research!  At lease there is a tie between Jared - Majestic Ape, Majestic Ape - Comet Ping Pong.  We know Jared is a convicted pedophile, and we know Majestic Ape now is connected to a known pedophile, and that what she/'it' said is REALLY referencing pedophilia, not just 'joking'.  Something needs to be done about this.......but what?

            Jared was being wiretapped for 10yrs and they had enough evidence after 4.  The lady who outed him to FBI has a vid on YT.  It made sick to have to continue phone calls with him talking about abuse.  It's like they did not want to take him down.  Or they were protecting certain people.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can hear him on one call saying the 9yr old boy he had was so delicious and disgusting things.

            personally, I think Jared was scapegoated.  It sounds like he was downloaded kiddy porn (which is sick) and had sex with 16-17 year old underage prostitutes (which is sick also),  but ...   meanwhile, jeffery epstein, who actually tough and pimped out underage girls, as young as 14  (24 victims at least) got minimum security 13 months and it was a spa experience (read about it)  he only had to spend 8 hours in lock up every night and the rest of the time he was free to go anywhere in the state and work.
           </p>
           <p>
            quite the contrast.

             Sorry to be that guy, but just because Epstein got away doesn't mean Fogel was scapegoated. IMO, Fogel got about what he deserved, and Epstein should have gotten much, much worse.

             The strange thing is that there wasn't just a 'collection' so to speak of child porn on his computer for himself, there was a MASSIVE amount as in terabytes of data. So much that he couldn't possibly even view it all. The question is why? Was he trading in a network to other sick fucks? So many questions and so little answers. But apparently yes the stuff he had was absolutely vile. DISCUSTING piece of shit.

              I think I read somewhere that he was known in college (in the earlier days of the Internet) for running a porn trading group. Don't know if he was known to trade CP back then, but knowing his current proclivities, he probably was. You know--vanilla for the normies and the "good stuff" for the inner circle, if you will. In my experience, there were so few real protections against that shit back then--I would find questionable material on BearShare and Kazaa on the regular. Something else I found weird--I clicked on a file once that was marked as an MP3, but it was actually a mislabeled JPEG. The photo was a teenage girl, nothing scandalous, standing in a back yard. It showed up in a search for Reel Big Fish Mp3's (shut up), and when I tried to open it, it wouldn't play. At some point--I don't remember why; maybe I had heard people rename photos to share on MP3 networks or something--I renamed it as a .jpg and saw the photo. Again, nothing scandalous, but I did get the only PM I ever got through a media sharing app--it said that they noticed I downloaded a file from them, and what did I think? What I thought was I should delete these programs. Which I did. But it's always bothered me--could it have been just a lonely chubby girl with a nice face looking to hook up through a file sharing app? Not likely. ICQ and AIM were already popular by then. I've always had the sneaking suspicion I was contacted by someone on her behalf--willing participant or not. As far as the volume of porn goes, I've had friends who developed an unhealthy relationship with (legal) porn. If you looked at their desks, you'd see three things, fairly universally--a big old bottle of hand lotion, moisture stains on the seat where his genitals would normally be (I know. Gross.), and spindles of CD-ROMs full of porn, which is just the overflow when they have too much porn on their machines. There's usually a folder on there with too much porn for one person to watch himself. One of them told me that he had "favorite girls", but his tastes changed kind of rapidly, so he would find EVERYTHING starring one actress, and when he gets tired of her, he goes to a new actress. But he always kept the old files as a backup. And this was a guy who was just collecting porn for himself. Maybe there's something about a collector'a mindset--you want to have the best, largest collection, and maybe if you're selling it, the crazier the collection, the more your legend grows. I don't know. I'm super high right now.

             I never thought that when I looked at her, either.  Just because she did not catch what he was up to does not make her complicit in any way or targeted as "strange".  I have my thoughts about the trans-genders, who there seem to be more and more of.  Some are truly trans-sexual and others like high profiles, may be cloned to make it more acceptable.  Just some thoughts.  Either way, we have no right to put anymore heartache on this woman and her family.  They are suffering enough.

            He is being protected.  He has a lot of money so he can bribe as well.  I am so glad this person had the courage to do what he did.  Although now he may be targeted by other pedos that are protecting Fogle.  These people should be put in with the hardest criminals.  Let him suffer just like his victims.

             Wasn't there another guy at his foundation who got arrested at the same time? How do these guys find each other? And why did Subway pick this guy and make him a multimillionaire? I mean, I get the weight-loss bit, but that's worth, what, a few K for the use of his likeness and story? But as a paid spokesman for years? I mean, they guy had the charisma of a flounder! Somebody at Subway had a reason to keep writing checks to this guy, IMO.

              I believe he may be involved with Sandusky, Penn State and a global ring.  That is just my guess.  This is how they are making the big money.  Check out The Wonderland Club (Operation Cathedral).  This may have been a replacement for that ring or just another one as well.
