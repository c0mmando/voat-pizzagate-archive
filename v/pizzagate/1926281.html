            To a certain extent, 
To keep it short, they do not live heaven on earth, 
they live 'pleasure' on earth in exchange for hell,
We the honest ones live a honest healthy life , and those of us who are truly loving will see the real heaven
Satan doesnt have heaven to offer 
PS im not religious , i just know god

            Just a heads up to red_red_wine. Thanks for making this post. It inspired me to write this:

           <p>
            Why? Because there's a very rocky road in this country regarding whether Homosexuality equates to Pedophilia. They should never be equated yet often they are and that's wrong.

            Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
           </p>
           <p>
            He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
           </p>
           <p>
            He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;
           </p>
           <p>
            His truth is marching on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
           </p>
           <p>
            Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!

            Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
           </p>

            His truth is marching on.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
           </p>
           <p>
            They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps:
           </p>
           <p>
            I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps,
           </p>
           <p>
            His day is marching on.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have read His fiery gospel writ in rows of burnished steel!
           </p>
           <p>
            "As ye deal with my condemners, so with you My grace shall deal!
           </p>
           <p>
            Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,"
           </p>
           <p>
            Since God is marching on.
           </p>
           <p>
            He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
           </p>
           <p>
            He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet!
           </p>
           <p>
            Our God is marching on.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,
           </p>
           <p>
            With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;
           </p>
           <p>
            As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free!
           </p>

            The major religions used to teach reincarnation -- what would be a better explanation of "eternal life."
           </p>
           <p>
            Used to think in terms of perhaps 100 lives -- but may be 1,000 lives or more?

            Meanwhile, some suggest that if you're male you will come back as female and vice versa.

            Cool story. I love spiritual dreams like that. Nothing like that scares me anymore after going through the DTs. That's one benefit of going to Hell and back. The normal world looks all the more beautiful.

            Rabbis are haters of Christ and the idea of an eternal afterlife. If you're an atheist or hater of Christ, that's the ultimate delusion "Judaism" wants you to accept. Then you may live as you list. No need to give an account. No consequences. Let us eat drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die. Until, whoops, surprise.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ever notice how atheists will go round and round w/ you? It's because they crave your validation, which eases their gnawing conscience. Homosexuals are the same way.

            Thanks. If I could add just one tiny thing. It's possible to enter the Kingdom of God while we are still here on Earth through the belief in Jesus Christ:
           </p>
           <p>
            "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." - John 3:16
           </p>
           <p>
            That eternal life begins as soon as you believe in Him. You join your brothers and sisters "in Christ" meaning you live IN the Kingdom of God.

            That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea. And great crowds gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat down. And the whole crowd stood on the beach. And he told them many things in parables, saying: “A sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them. Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil, ...

            I tell you this, brothers: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. Behold! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed.

            “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.

            And he said, “With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it? It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when sown on the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth, yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and puts out large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.”
