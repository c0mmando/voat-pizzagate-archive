<p>Working Theory:
-1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Judith\'s mother (accomplice). </p>
<p>Witness: Clare Torao</p>
<p>-2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge.</p>
<p>Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Michael Caine (note: the incident mentioned in the ‚ÄúBlame It On Rio‚Äù CDAN Blind with that underaged girl makes him a suspect in this incident), Joseph Sargent.</p>
<p>Witness: Lorraine Gary. </p>
<p>Accomplice: Adria Later, Judith‚Äôs mother</p>
<p>-The Murder:</p>
<p>Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. &quot;The most effective lies are based off a truth.&quot; The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who\'s character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants. </p>
<p>Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn\'t take (her heart was too strong). Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public\'s emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was beloved by the country as a whole). She would have been the type to talk when she got older, so I suspect getting rid of lose ends to cover pedowood\'s tracks had a part in the motive.</p>
<p>Accomplices: LA PD, the media, Ruth Hansen, Jack Dorsey.</p>
<p>Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a hysterical breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (25 year talent agent) warns Hollywood that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith‚Äôs fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the ‚Äúmurder suicide‚Äù by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.</p>
<p>The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match &quot;Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. Possibly for preparations. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the &quot;murder suicide&quot; angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith\'s was on top (which would make the &quot;murder suicide angle&quot; IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the murder suicide narrative. Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly something like a &quot;Ryuguu Gas Bomb&quot;. What this basically is is that it\'s an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source can be programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course in such a scenario, one is relying on the fire to destroy the evidence, which includes the set up. Note that an autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi. Given the progress rate of decomposistion assuming a hot summer (ie July), the claim of a death date of 7/25-7/26 (based on the lie told by Ruth Hansen) is wrong, for the smell would have been obvious at that time of death.</p>
<p>Murder Weapons: Pistol with silencer, gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.</p>
<p>Post Murder: 7/27/1988. Don Bluth possibly threatened in regards to Judith Barsi‚Äôs death? I suspect Spielberg found out about that attempted protective migration (which means Judith would have told if she got older) and had to wrap up some loose ends.</p>',

           Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a hysterical breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (25 year talent agent) warns Hollywood that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith‚Äôs fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the ‚Äúmurder suicide‚Äù by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.
          </p>
          <p>
           The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match "Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. Possibly for preparations. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the "murder suicide" angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith's was on top (which would make the "murder suicide angle" IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the murder suicide narrative. Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly something like a "Ryuguu Gas Bomb". What this basically is is that it's an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source can be programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course in such a scenario, one is relying on the fire to destroy the evidence, which includes the set up. Note that an autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi. Given the progress rate of decomposistion assuming a hot summer (ie July), the claim of a death date of 7/25-7/26 (based on the lie told by Ruth Hansen) is wrong, for the smell would have been obvious at that time of death.

           Post Murder: 7/27/1988. Don Bluth possibly threatened in regards to Judith Barsi‚Äôs death? I suspect Spielberg found out about that attempted protective migration (which means Judith would have told if she got older) and had to wrap up some loose ends.

            Darkknight, maybe it would be a good idea to crosspost this to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/magicmemes">
             v/magicmemes
            </a>
            with "Help Wanted" in the title? You should DM
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/Empress">
             @Empress
            </a>
            and ask her if that would be okay in that sub. She helped set up
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatememes">
             v/pizzagatememes
            </a>
            back in the day and might have some good advice about how to tap Voat's meme makers to help with exposing the pedos in Hollywood.

            You've done so much research...it really needs to get made into a spreadable format for the outside world. :-)

            These are the images that need to be converted into full memes. Just insert the text and hashtags into them and post the completed memes and we can really go to town in terms of public awareness.
