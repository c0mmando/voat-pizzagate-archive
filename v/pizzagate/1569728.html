I agree that it is probably not something that matters too much and it\'s probably better to leave a few links where people can get started. Here is the original submission with added links:</p>
<p>We have done an excellent job researching this and while we should continue to do so I believe it is now time to shift the primary focus from investigation to exposure. Here is what I propose:</p>
<p>Find 12 people that you have a relationship based on mutual trust and respect with. Copy this message and send it to them in a private message through your preferred medium. If you prefer you can adjust it to your liking or write your own version of it.</p>
<p>The global citizen investigation into a human/child trafficking and prostitution ring has reached a point where we need every honest person on the planet to pay attention. The monopoly media outlets and various „fact-checking“ sites claim it to be debunked nonsense. This is far from the truth, on the contrary the discoveries being made each day are increasingly alarming and incriminating.</p>
<p>Human/Child trafficking and prostitution is one of the most serious human rights issues we face. It is the third largest international crime industry behind only drugs and arms trafficking and reportedly generates around 32$ billion dollars in profits annually. Is the notion that some corrupt politicians are somehow involved with that and are taking their slice of that profit really so outrageous? Why are we being convinced to dismiss these stories with an angry condemnation of „fake news“ and „dangerous propaganda“?</p>
<p>If you investigate independently all angles of this topic I am sure you will find that the implications of the wikileaks e-mails and the ensuing discoveries made by researchers are very disturbing and have not been properly investigated by authorities, let alone „debunked“. Please investigate the following topics thoroughly:</p>
<p>Laura Silsby/Laura Gayler</p>
<p>Monica Petersen</p>
<p>Comet Ping Pong</p>
<p>Dyncorp</p>
<p>Pegasus Museum</p>
<p>James Alefantis</p>
<p>Sasha Lord</p>
<p>Majestic Ape/Heavy Breathing</p>
<p>The Tunnels aligning with J.A. properties</p>
<p>John Podesta and his e-mails released by wikileaks</p>
<p>Tony Podesta</p>
<p>„Pizza Slut“</p>
<p>Internation Republican Foundation</p>
<p>The Clinton Foundation</p>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein</p>
<p>An Open Secret (documentary)</p>
<p>The Franklin cover-up – A conspiracy of silence (documentary)</p>
<p>And now for the most important part. If you know as I do that there is something to this story and you want to help, this is a tactic that has proven enormously powerful in the past.</p>
<p>Chain-letters are an age old method that existed long before the internet. A person would write a letter and encourage the recipient to carry a message on to 10-15 other people and mailing them back who they sent it to. Letters like this would often travel far across the world and get millions of people involved. In many cases, disingenuous promises of becoming a part of a &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; were used to trick people and after the internet these type of letters are usually associated with spam.</p>
<p>This is a variation of this method as there is no need to trace where this goes. It just needs to go everywhere. Just like meme magic we can use spam magic to our advantage. You may call this &quot;spam&quot; and there are those who will insist on doing just that, but in this case there are no tricks involved. This is very real, very urgent and there is ample evidence to support that conclusion.</p>
<p>By choosing carefully 12 people we want to influence with this message and doing it on a personal level we are ensuring that the exposure is not only widespread but also intelligently targeted. The benefits of this method include:</p>
<p>Nr.1 The people receiving the message are more likely to be getting it from a person they trust and respect.</p>
<p>Nr.2 People do not need to post this material publicly. Many people are justifiably uncomfortable with the idea of exposing themselves to the kind of prejudice that the monopoly media is promoting and even putting their lives/careers in danger.</p>
<p>Nr.3 This happens really fast. Even if only half of those you reach out to respond and only half of them forward the message we are still adding three more people who will send this to 36 people. If half of those people respond and half of those continue the chain, the number reached from the efforts of one individiual will have reached a (9*12+3) 111 new people! Every single person who participates in this creates a new equation within this equation that will keep growing at the same rate. Imagine if we all start doing this how fast it can spread. Every person counts.</p>
<p>There is no reason to post this message publicly, in fact it is preferable to do it in private since it limits the ways that disinformation agents can push their propaganda to put people away. Printing the message out and sending it in an actual letter to people can also be effective. It is crucial that the arguments for the effectiveness of this method is included in the message you send people. The main goal is to get people to participate and they will only do that if they understand that they can actually make a huge difference with minimal effort.</p>
<p>I believe I am doing this to protect the most vulnerable among us and I do not seek to inflict harm against any person innocent of wrongdoings. I want everyone accused of involvement in these horrendous crimes to have a fair trial in an open court of law. I believe I have an ethical responsibility to spread this information to as many people as I can as quickly as I can, so that those who are guilty of these horrendous crimes will have to answer for them and face the consequences of their action.</p>
<p>You can start your investigation by checking out this link that have compiled most of the relevant information regarding this investigation:</p>
<p>voat.co/v/pizzagate/1497611</p>
<p>pizzagate.wiki/Main_Page</p>
<p>I also recommend watching the many videos and documentaries posted about this online. If you are receiving this message it means that the person who sent it to you has confidence in your ability to research this information without bias or cognitive dissonance. </p>
<p>I ask you to do this small thing that can have a huge collective impact. 12 people. Choose them carefully based on your own criteria of what you think can further the cause. Copy/paste this message or write your own version of it. The only thing that matters is that we get the word out about this and demonstrate how we can use the power of exponential growth to our advantage. By navigating that growth with precision through the correct channels of trust and respect we can take this investigation and it‘s exposure to a different level.</p>
