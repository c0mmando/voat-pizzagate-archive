<p>On another note, I have a personal theory and it goes like this.</p>
<p>Child abuse and sacrifice seems to go back as far as records go. We know about Moloch from early parts of the bible. I ask myself a question: </p>
<p>Why would the devil want child sacrifice and abuse? My theory is that the devil knows that we are all built with a natural affection for babies. It is built into our biology. When we care about babies, we care about what happens to them, the environment they grow up in, the people they interact and make friends with, and everything that may affect their lives. This is a care for the world, in general. We want babies to grow up and have a great life. This care adds to our own desires to make the world a better place. </p>
<p>The devil, on the other hand, wants people who don\'t care about anything. He wants them to do all kinds of evil, and the only way he can have servants like that, is for them to be stone-hearted. Uncaring about anything that is good or holy. Such men and women can infect, harm and destroy anything which it would please their master to destroy. It seems to be a fair explanation for why people don\'t even have children together, such as the Clinton\'s not being mother and father of Chelsea Clinton, and quite possibly the Obama\'s and their children. They don\'t want strong ties to this world, or it\'s betterment. They can\'t afford to, or they may find their natural affections growing, rather than being stifled. </p>
<p>Would be interested to hear any thoughts. Cheers.</p>',

            babies are pure and innocent. To do all that means you are capable and willing to do anything. So, the devil asks you to show you can do his bidding.

            ellen g white a mason buried under an obelisk, was the hit in the head prophetess, yes she claims to have "visions" while having fainting spells after her head injury, what prophetess forms a church on a failed prophecy? read the great disappointment and find out how william miller was the false prophet who's date she believed and would not back down when everyone wasn't raptured and it failed, she had another vision clearing all that up, now we all know to set a date is to break God's law, so who would join a masonic church who was founded on breaking Gods law and date setting and then when it failed refused to admit that failure and made up another lie to cover,
            <br/>
            just watch the videos offered on those youtube channels and you decide if you want to follow this crypto Jewess as she tries to get everyone to observe the Jewish Sabbath by saying Sunday worship is the mark of the beast , so ya mean Jews won't get the mark? what about Buddhist's?  what about muslims? so ya mean it was one of the 3 masonic created CULTS of America that only attack western Christianity?
            <br/>
            lol, morminism, jehovas witness and 7th day adventists all invented around the same time in America, do you want to observe veganism like a moonie? they demand you eat SOY with their cooked up eden diet, refusing the fact that we were booted out of eden and God Himself taught us how to skin and eat a cooked animal and wear its skins because we were now cursed and the ground is cursed and by the sweat of our brow do we eat our bread, they have their own bible that cuts out what they don't like and inserts ellen g whites plagiarism's into it, this woman who claimed to not be able to write or read well , plafgurized her books, read the White Lie by walter rea, if you can afford it because its being bought up like all books that really tell you the truth, last time i checked a used paperback on amazon was 45 bucks, so they are hiding the truth that way too, these scoundrels are basically masonic Satanists at the top and all you underlings are just PAYEES, so stfu if you don't want to be baptized in ellen g white and Jesus's name, you don't get a say about that, so be aware, they are a cult and wow are they loosing members, that's why the push to farm you out here, they think your stupid and don't know some of us are former CULT members and expose Adventism at every chance

            (1) Cremation of care means just what the words say. The rich f---- who go there are trained not to care about humanity. If you think about the people who go, it is chilling. (2) The dark forces or satanic ones lack the God spark so cannot create. They hate women and children for this reason, their creativity. Nazis also hate women and children......one reason they enjoy raping them.

            Yes I agree. Back when I was still in Hollywood and after my children had been threatened and stolen, every single acting agent told me to forget about my children and maybe I would work again. At the time I was absolutely horrified. How could they say this to me? Why were my children a part of my career and why would it be necessary to forget about them?? My partner up in Vancouver in our production company (he insisted we call it Lionsgate) told me to- " forget about your children or you are dead". How could all these people be so heartless I remember thinking. They are heartless and I hope they all rot in hell

             It seems to be a fair explanation for why people don't even have children together, such as the Clinton's not being mother and father of Chelsea Clinton, and quite possibly the Obama's and their children.

            Because he hates God and anything God loves. He especially hates that God, out of love for his fallen Creation, went deep undercover, took the lowly form of a mortal baby instead of a worldly king, and thus tricked Satan into instigating His death and consequent Resurrection. That, of course, completely thwarted Satan's victory over the world and snatched the souls of sinners which were his by right, since the infinite worth and goodness of God the Son more than paid all the debt to God the Father incurred by sin. The fact that Jesus fooled him by unexpectedly becoming a baby is a never-ending thorn in Satan's side and why he wants all babies dead. He also doesn't want any of them to grow up to be saints and further humiliate him.

            No, we are not. Some people have "cuteness aggression" to an extreme degree. I believe cuteness aggression is a sign of mental illness, but people without it still use their phrases like "I want to eat you up" or "I could just hug you to death".
           </p>
           <p>
            First thing is you got to stop assuming that people are born good like you were, and only corrupted later. Around 1 in 50 people is born evil. They take joy in the suffering of others. The happiness of others angers them. These people typically cascade corruption into the population as a whole. By the Pareto curve, we can estimate the most prolific 4% of rapists commit about 64% of the rapes - these are the kind of numbers we're looking at.
           </p>
           <p>
            You are so innocent about the nature of man, and you must release yourself from the good and evil dichotomy to understand more. Good people and evil people are the far ends of the bell curve. The center is selfishness that doesn't violate others.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The devil" is just one of the evil gods, usually depicted as a variant of Pan (renamed Faunus by Romans). Pan, the nature deity of fields forests and fertility, of pastures and shepherds and jam sessions (impromptu music).
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me say that again in case you missed it: the symbolism assigned to the Christian devil is one of nature's fertility, just one of many examples where unholy forces shaped the church's history.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the devil is either an evil god, or a servant of Yeevoh (YHVH, chooser of jews), who is certainly an evil god. Each god has its own appetites, even the good ones, and they all thrive on the energy released from a potent emotional experience. The exception is God Prime: He who has neither image nor name, whose laws cannot be broken, God of Truth and Nature, the Creator and God of Reality-as-It-is. He is something else entirely.
           </p>

            Moloch "eats" babies. He is fed by their agony more than their deaths... As I said, each god has its appetites and particular rituals. They must consume the spiritual byproduct of strong emotions or they will "die" (a powerless sleep that may last forever). And Moloch grants worldly favors in exchange for such sacrifice.

            Again your naivete is showing. The devil's servants have an appetite for The Sickness. Have you ever felt the thrill of cheating on someone you care about? Actually let's dial it back. Have you ever felt the thrill of risking being caught masturbating? Someone could walk in at any minute, ooh how perversely exciting. That feeling is The Sickness. It's the thrill of risking something important to you, usually for no good reason. That feeling becomes a fetish and addiction. No one identifies with their fetish without it. Like my girl likes to be tied up and blindfolded from time to time, but it's not
            <em>
             who she is
            </em>
            , and it's not the "wrongness" of it that turns her on.

            The devil's servants are servants of The Sickness in themselves. Getting away with naughty behavior, so to speak, is one of their favorite things. Just like any drug addict, they need more and more and stronger and more. Killing and eating children that you've just raped is The Sickest Thing that can be individually accomplished.

             Interesting and, for me anyway, thought provoking. It is important to also mention that a normal young child, one that is caring and good can be turned by way of extreme trauma torture called ritual abuse. That child, after years of the abuse, will grow up with all the characteristics of a psychopath yet this was induced. I  look at many of the Antifa brats and I seriously wonder how many of them are victims of SRA or Ritual abuse? Maybe 50%?? My ex wife was a victim and when she was cornered (one of her lies exposed) she became a hysterical violent maniac that was/is capable of anything, including killing, which I witnessed once when she attempted to drown an 8 week old kitten in front of my 2 small children. Her idea of humor was an old man crossing the street and getting run over and killed. Other people's pain turned her on. Honestly, I had(at the time) no reference for her behavior. Many many years later it all fits into place. She most likely still gets a thrill knowing that her lies about me and her network of people around her helped to completely destroy what was once a viable career. In hindsight I am grateful to be out of that industry. Most of you would never believe the 'good guy' actors and what they really are about. A good example is Robert Redford and his support for the film Cuties. Ask yourself why would he (the quintessential tree hugger) endorse a film like that and even give that film a director award??

              There's a very good chance your ex was possessed. I was listening to an exorcist today talking about how in his experience over 50% of the women who are possessed did nothing themselves that would could lead to it (such as necromancy, fortune-telling, etc). He said 80 to 90% of them were raped or victims of SRA.
