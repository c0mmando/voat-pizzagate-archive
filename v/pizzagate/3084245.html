<p>..Since then, the cost of the ground lease, paid to the owner of the land, Cooper Union, has skyrocketed, while the rents at the building haven’t kept up... Current tenants include Creative Arts Agency, co-working firm Spaces and law firm Moses &amp; Singer.</p>

<p>For Rosen, landing the Chrysler Building would be akin to adding the Kohinoor Diamond to an already formidable collection of gems.

<p>Well, fyi, the Chrysler Building has already been mentioned on the WebbWatch forum , <a href="https://voat.co/v/WebbWatch/2015509/9946470">here</a></p>
<p>Aby Rosen also owns the Gramercy Park Hotel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aby_Rosen">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aby_Rosen</a></p>
<p>The Italian restaurant Maialino is housed at the hotel <a href="http://www.gramercyparkhotel.com/dining/maialino">http://www.gramercyparkhotel.com/dining/maialino</a></p>
<p>Interestingly, there is a wikileaks email between Tony Podesta and brother John suggesting a meet up there, mentioned in this voat post:</p>

Maialino does NOT mean &quot;pig roast&quot; in Italian as Tony Podesta suggests. It means little pig or piglett, am I wrong? Something else off: Maialino\'s is NOT on 21st and Park Ave., it is on Lexington Ave.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In that correspondence between the Podesta brothers, Tony mentions that earlier in the day he is meeting with his Amgen client Ellen McCarthy and that the Italian dinner is planned for after their theatre visit.</p>
<p>Ellen McCarthy has now moved on to Polaris Industries : <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181012005471/en/Ellen-McCarthy-Joins-Polaris-Vice-President-Government">Ellen McCarthy Joins Polaris as Vice President of Government Affairs</a></p>

<p>..<strong>Amgen gave a crap ton of money to the Podesta group which seems pretty suspicious in and of itself. Anyway, they are a part of BioFlorida. BioFlorida had one member named RTI Surgical which was caught illegally selling Ukrainian organs, bone marrow, and tissue.</strong> My suspicion is it is a mixture of criminal and legitimate pharma groups hodgepodged together in order to appear more benign. Martin Shkreli (he is a piece of shit, I know) claimed that he was small time compared to the likes of Amgen.</p>
<p>I haven\'t looked into Amgen individually before but <strong>it seems they have been investing heavily into stem cells</strong>. Ukraine is also a major provider of stem cells and they have even caught hospitals killing and harvesting the bones of newborns in order to derive stem cells from the bone marrow. It is worth looking into if they are clean or not involved in trafficking body-parts.</p>

            Well, Obama was clearly eager to support Meyer's Shake Shack

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Shake Shack (NYSE: SHAK) is an American fast casual restaurant chain based in New York City. It started out as a hot dog cart inside Madison Square Park in 2001, and its popularity steadily grew. In 2004, it moved to a stand within the park, expanding its menu from New York-style hotdogs to one with hamburgers, hotdogs, fries and its namesake milkshakes. The company advertises it uses natural, hormone and antibiotic free Angus beef
            </p>
            <p>
             Since its opening, Shake Shack has grown to be the largest part of the USHG's portfolio. Its average store revenue of US$4 million is more than twice that of McDonald's average store revenue within the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
             In July 2011, it was announced that Shake Shack had reached a deal with the MTA to open a location in the lower level of Grand Central Terminal.[20] This project was delayed because the tenant occupying the space Shake Shack was to take over, Mexican eatery Zócalo, refused to vacate after the expiration of their lease and filed suit, arguing that the "bidding process (for retail space in Grand Central) is corrupted."[21] The suit was dismissed and Zócalo appealed. In October 2012 Zócalo filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[22] In early May 2013, Zócalo vacated the space, and the new outlet opened for business on October 5, 2013.
            </p>
            <p>
             By August 2014, Shake Shack outlets had begun operating in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Washington, D.C., Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Texas.[25] That month, reports surfaced that the company was preparing to go public with an IPO and was discussing an underwriting with a number of investment banks, including J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.

             Last night, President Obama attended a Hillary Clinton fundraiser at the Gramercy home of NYC’s favorite restaurateur, Danny Meyer. 65 people were at the event. Most guests paid $25,000 to attend, while the chairmen donated $250,000. No word yet on what the food spread was like at the fundraiser. Two and a half years ago, President Obama had a meal with Michelle and some of their friends at Meyer’s Italian restaurant, Maialino. President Obama is staying in NYC today and tomorrow to participate in meetings and events at the United Nations.

It opened late last month as a kid sister to the much-admired Redbury hotels in Hollywood and South Beach, and it imported some of the smudged-eyeliner glamour of those destinations.

            <p>
             Matthew Russell Rolston (born 1 March 1955) is an American artist, photographer, director and creative director. Rolston is known for his signature lighting techniques[1] and detailed approach to art direction and design and has been repeatedly identified throughout his career with the revival and modern expression of Hollywood glamour.[
            </p>
            <p>
             Rolston also conceives, writes and directs film projects, having directed over 100 music videos and 200 television commercials in his career, including collaborations with artists as diverse as Madonna, Janet Jackson, Beyoncé Knowles, Miley Cyrus and Marilyn Manson, as well as numerous advertising campaigns - both print and television - for clients such as L’Oreal, Revlon, Estée Lauder, Clairol, Levi's, Pantene, Elizabeth Arden, Gap and Polo Ralph Lauren, among others.
            </p>
            <p>
             As Rolston began to redefine the scope of his career, he expanded his practice into the fields of creative direction and branding, developing innovative projects in the area of experiential design, including hospitality projects, product design and new media ventures. Rolston’s first hospitality brand creation, developed for Los Angeles-based hotel and restaurant owner Sam Nazarian’s company
             <strong>
              sbe Entertainment
             </strong>
             , opened in 2010. Called The Redbury, Rolston was deeply involved in every aspect of the project, from the naming to the logo, from design concepts to marketing strategies.

              Sofitel Hotels &amp; Resorts is a chain of luxury hotels based in Paris, France, and owned by AccorHotels since 1980. Founded in 1964 in France, Sofitel quickly developed worldwide to reach more than 200 properties. In 2008, Sofitel became a brand of luxury hotels only, downsized its property count to 89, and created new brands.

              The first Sofitel in Colombia opened in 1995,[5] and the first Sofitel in Japan opened in 1996.[6] In 1997, the group announced the opening of the Sofitel New York Hotel, a $90 million investment on West 44th Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas (next to the

              The New York Yacht Club is a private social club and yacht club based in New York City and Newport, Rhode Island.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 1845, the club's first clubhouse was established — a modest, Gothic-revival building in Hoboken, New Jersey, on land donated by Commodore John Cox Stevens. After outgrowing its cramped quarters, the club moved to several other locations, including Staten Island, Glen Cove, New York and Mystic, Connecticut.
             </p>
             <p>
              Its primary clubhouse is a six-storied Beaux-Arts landmark with a nautical-themed limestone facade, located at 37 West 44th Street in midtown Manhattan. Opened in 1901, the clubhouse was designed by Warren and Wetmore (1898), architects of the exterior of Grand Central Terminal [and the Helmsey Building].

             When the New York Central Railroad’s chief engineer William Wilgus came up with the concept of Grand Central Terminal, there were most likely a few people out there that felt he was completely nuts. Despite the fact that at the time the NYC was one of the mightiest railroads in not only the United States, but the world, the price tag for the project was incredibly high.
             <strong>
              Without the concept of “air rights” it is likely that the project would never have moved forward.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Covering the Terminal’s tracks and allowing buildings to be constructed in the “air” above turned out to be a very sound investment. The railroad owned significant amounts of highly profitable, prime New York real estate, and the neighborhood surrounding Grand Central and built on that land became known as
             <strong>
              Terminal City. The Biltmore Hotel, Commodore Hotel, and the Yale Club were all parts of this city within a city.
             </strong>
             But it was the New York Central Building, finished in 1929, that was the crowning achievement of Terminal City, and an appropriate companion for Grand Central Terminal.
            </p>
            <p>
             ... High above street level are the faces of American Bison, situated above stylized compasses, representative of how the railroads essentially built this country – or at least how it contributed to the migration of people to the west. Sharing a similar concept,
             <strong>
              a face resembling the Greek god of nature and the wild, Pan, appears towards the very top of the building.
             </strong>
             Eagles, representative of the United States, can be found above some of the doors to the building, and** lions, a symbol of power can be found in the tunnel that carries Park Avenue through the building.**

             Spaces CEO Martijn Roordink On How The Dutch Coworking Company Will Double Its U.S. Footprint Next Year

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Between WeWork becoming the largest private office tenant in Manhattan, D.C. and London, Knotel’s leasing binge this year and Convene’s foray into designing and building flexible workspaces for landlords, you would be forgiven for thinking the coworking landscape is close to capacity. Not so, says Spaces co-founder and CEO Martijn Roordink. He founded his flexible workspace company in Amsterdam in 2008 and sold it to Dutch giant Regus — which has since changed its name to IWG — in 2014. In recent weeks, it has announced a slew of new leases in New York City, and it is readying a major expansion in 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
             Last month, Spaces inked a deal for 110K SF at the Chrysler Building, the company’s biggest location in the city. It is also taking nearly 100K SF at 787 11th Ave. and 62K SF at 175 Pearl St. in Dumbo. As of this week, it will begin opening up the 11th, 12th and penthouse levels at the 110K SF location at Brookfield’s the Lofts building in the Manhattan West megaproject.
            </p>
            <p>
             The firm already has locations at the
             <strong>
              Helmsley Building at 230 Park Ave.
             </strong>
             and at the Falchi Building in Long Island City. At the beginning of the year, Spaces announced it was expanding to Staten Island.
