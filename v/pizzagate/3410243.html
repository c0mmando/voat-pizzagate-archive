<p>Tracy Twyman Quote: What you need to understand is that, in the OTO’s structure, they “officially” kind of skip over the 10th degree. The ninth degree is, according to several sources, dedicated to vaginal sex magick mysteries, including the consumption of menstrual blood. The eleventh degree is about “Crossing the Abyss,” as I mentioned. These are sex rituals involving sodomy, killing your own “personality” to make room for the rebirth of your “Holy Guardian Angel” (allegedly your higher self), and then landing safely on the other side of the Abyss, if you’re lucky. It is implied that not every person who goes through this ritual comes out sane or fully functioning.</p>
<p>Watch the movie. Find Tracys analysis of it. Gemini Killer is 11, twins, these are the pillars of creation which they seek to destroy through their abominations.</p>',

               I saw that. I have not bothered with this one's submission history, other than to remember she's useless as teets on a boar and posts disinfo. But i would really like to know how many deleted posts is enough, is it 2 or 3? Do they have to be warned?

                Typically, when we notice a pattern of repeated disregard of the submission rules (i.e. they've had the rules explained to them several times in a brief period) we delete two and issue a ban warning and ban after the third deleted post. If it's a sporadic thing -- like a rule-breaking submission once or twice every few months, and/or doesn't seem like they're doing it on purpose, I tend to play it more by ear. I am not fond of banning people who aren't clearly here to fuck with us. So if it's an intermittent contributor with no obvious ill intent, I don't pounce on them with a ban even if they've had two posts deleted a few months before.

                 I think she did it twice in two weeks, which means the second time she did it on purpose, imo.

                 Between that and the disinfo, it makes me feel like she is a shill for the LDS/FLDS.

                  Possibly. Sometimes people have a couple drinks and get on the board and do things like this, though, too. Pizzagate is difficult. Sometimes people act out.

                      I haven't banned anyone since Donkey impersonated LDT3. I'm confused. You asked me why I haven't banned this user. Now you think too many people have been banned? Do you want people banned, or not?  :-/

                       Yeah, that's what i thought. Never gonna answer as to why you are so unfair, and insist on protecting a rouge powermod and her army of alts. Putt doesn't protect her anymore, and neither should you.

              You know, I did a SearchVoat to see if I'd given a ban warning and did not find one. I am too busy IRL to dig for evidence of a pattern worthy of a ban at the moment. If you want to hit me with a list of links demonstrating this is more than an occasional slip up, I will proceed with a ban.

            The first Exorcist movie is pizzagate. I was watching a "theory" video about The Exorcist a few weeks ago and the narrator said the hidden meaning is that the movie director raped the girl early on in the movie and that's what sent her mad.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I watched the movie again because I didn't remember that part, and I thought the theory was plausible. Then as I watched the rest of The Exorcist it kinda dawned on me that all the people that were alone with her abused her. Then I thought further about what the movie was subliminaly saying.
           </p>
           <p>
            The men who spend time alone with her work for the police, medical profession, the church and the movie industry. The Exorcist is about getting men in these professions involved in child rape and the demon is the blackmailer/s.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us; but he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. His attack is psychological, Damien. And powerful."
