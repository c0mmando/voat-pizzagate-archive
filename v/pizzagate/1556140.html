So try 3 in getting some eyes at the Detroit Car Week</p>
<hr />
<p>In 2013 m.live published an article that sources Heresa L. Flores who runs Stop Our Adolescents from Prostitution. The article is full of links to how and why human and child trafficking is happening around carweek. <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2013/01/detroit_auto_show_draws_pimps.html">http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2013/01/detroit_auto_show_draws_pimps.html</a> - <a href="http://archive.is/0EvEq">http://archive.is/0EvEq</a></p>
<p>&quot;I think it\'s actually epidemic&quot; said Flores. &quot;Probably one of the worst cities. I talk to a lot of survivors on a daily basis and everybody has been trafficked through Detroit at one point.&quot;</p>
<p>Flores\'s organisation would deliver folder to 200 motels and hotels accross the area: &quot;&quot;A lot of times the motel owners or the staff will recognize somebody who\'s on that poster,&quot;</p>
<p>Flores herself being a victim of trafficking: &quot;On one occasion Flores said she was kidnapped and taken to an &quot;inner-city Detroit nasty, dirty motel where two dozen men were waiting. She was &quot;sold the the highest bidder&quot; and &quot;drugged, beaten and sexually molested to point of unconsciousness.&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>in 2016 FOX2Detroit also published an article about the rise in trafficking surrounding Detroit Carweek citing Mel Baggett which is from an organization called All Worthy of Love or AWOL <a href="http://www.fox2detroit.com/news/local-news/70731052-story">http://www.fox2detroit.com/news/local-news/70731052-story</a> - <a href="http://archive.is/albO1">http://archive.is/albO1</a></p>
<p>&quot;A majority of the victims come from the foster care system - and the predators know right where to find them.&quot; How is this possible without anyone noticing?</p>
<p>&quot;Experts say they prey on girls ages 11 to 14 years old. Once the victims are groomed the traffickers are looking for opportunity. Large events like the auto show for example provide plenty of room for criminal activity.&quot;</p>
<p>The Detroit Free Press in 2016 claims Michigan experienced a 16% increase in human trafficking cases according to POLARIS data <a href="http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2016/01/28/michigan-human-trafficking-cases/79453648/">http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2016/01/28/michigan-human-trafficking-cases/79453648/</a> - <a href="http://archive.is/VrcAX">http://archive.is/VrcAX</a></p>

<hr />
<p>At no point anyone could or should ever state that: Anyone who attends the carweek is suspected of child abuse.</p>
<p>I think the main link here is SOAP &amp; AWOL &amp; Chicago Police and the reports that the Carweek is a proven hub for sex trafficking. Where are all the victims and related arrests? Also curious to see if someone could background check SOAP &amp; AWOL see if they are involved or possibly hindered in their efforts. </p>
<p>Finally I\'m curious to see if there are anyone could dig up more people or organisation linked with PG attending or otherwise involved in Carweek. But remember just because they are involved does not prove they are guilty. However seeing that Carweek is happening now it could be interesting to keep a close eye and see if anything odd will occur...</p>',

            Same phenomenon also happens around the Superbowl each year, no matter where it is.  However, there is an active media pushback to discredit the idea, including Snopes calling saying there is "no data" supporting the idea - enough to make me think it is worse than we imagine.

              just google suberbowl and sex trafficking and you get a host of articles, half of which seem to try to discredit it, I noticed snopes was on the list so went with that.  I don't buy the discrediting, or it is a sort of half truth - based on the idea there are a lot more busts leading up to the superbowl because the city attempts to clean up for it.

            I don't have a link handy to post, but dailymail had actually posted it first. China invested a great deal of money to purchase riverfront properties. Promised that it'd produce jobs. Detroit is a great target for pedobears because there's just so many youth with nothing to do, but get into trouble. The ones who aren't in trouble are probably guarded well by momma bears. Their MO is preying on disadvantaged youth, quite the steady supply of that there after it was hit by the carfentinyl epi.

              the news of China "investing" into the USA, and it's feature was a ton of riverfront property in Detroit (at the time it was welcome (and is if it passes the smell test), Detroit needs work, but not if it's bad), I do believe they included docks and all for shipping. I'm going to scrounge up the article if I can. I read it via their app and didnt have a way to save stories there.
             </p>
             <p>
              Edited to add- This is another article that talks of China's wish to invest in the city, and that's good. I've just become a bit jaded, especially anything involving shipping waters.

             <blockquote>
             </blockquote>
             <pre><code>"We're going to see another 100 Chinese companies investing in Detroit over the next five years."

The association hosted a real estate meeting last month at the Madison Building in Detroit with a delegation from several provinces in China.
</code></pre>
             <p>
              ** Stevanovich said a group of Chinese government officials and investors is particularly interested in a riverfront development concept. The idea would be to create a marina, resort and yacht building development in metro Detroit. Ten delegates from Hainan and Nantong provinces, Chinese business leaders and Miami-based yacht builder Paracas Yachts have been in contact about the potential project, Stevanovich said.**
             </p>
             <pre><code>**The group is hoping to create the marina on the Detroit riverfront or along the 34 miles of waterfront on Lake St. Clair in Macomb County**&gt;

               So this case is interesting in light of my experience. I live in Michigan and know a few Chinese girls who were trafficked, by boat, to Chicago. They were rescued and placed in homes here in West Michigan.
              </p>
              <p>
               There have also been warnings in my mom circles regarding creepy men driving by and talking to kids, trying to pick them up. We've even had problems at our mall. There seems to be a lot of action here.

            I like you post, if you have been getting things deleted on here maybe read the rules thread and make sure your following them. I think all of the major events, like the olympics and Super Bowl are highly suspect for this stuff so it seems likely you're on to something here...

             Also I want to point out it is my opinion that the mods not "decide" if something is relevant just make sure the poster has made it clear why they think it is relevant. It offends me greatly every single time something is deleted on here. I agree we need rules, but what we do not need is mod opinions censoring the content.

              well I can somewhat understand there reasoning, probably my lack of proper grammar, they read the deleted post as
             </p>
             <p>
              joe biden &gt; creepy + carweek &gt; traficking = JB attending carweek to have sxx
             </p>
             <p>
              while I was not making that allegation, I was just trying to state
joe biden &gt; creepy + carweek &gt; creepy = could there be a link?
             </p>
             <p>
              They have the right to delete it as they think it's an unsourced claim, I thought they misunderstood my post, but it's up to me to make that clear...
             </p>
             <p>
              However sometimes you can spot interesting links that need further research to be turned into a accepted post here
