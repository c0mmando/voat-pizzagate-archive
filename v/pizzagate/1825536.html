            Another wasted opportunity.   Pedophilia mentioned on MSM (ish) and you don't flood comments section?  Perfect opportunity to invite people here.. I know I did.  I potentially red-pilled thousands. .. or at least piqued a lot of curiousities.  Wtf?  Read comments and you can probably pick me out.  Where the f was everyone?   And yes, TPTB know who I am now and I don't care. I'd give my life to put an end to this. (But I'm healthy and non-suicidal.)

            It’s difficult to sum up of what the Frankfurt School of Germany was. Most of following comes from Satan’s Secret Agents: The Frankfurt School and Their Evil Agenda. The Frankfurt School were mostly Germany Jewish scholars, who developed highly provocative and original perspectives on contemporary society and culture, drawing on Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, and Weber. The Frankfurt School plotted among themselves to corrupt and disrupt culture and society’s very core principles without an invading army. When Hitler and Nazis came to power, the Institute was closed and its members, by various routes,
            <strong>
             fled to the U.S.and ended up deeply imbedded at major academic universities across the country such as Columbia, Princeton, Brandeis, Stanford and California at Berkeley.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically, the Frankfurt School believed that as long as an individual had the belief — or even the hope of belief — that his divine gift of reason could solve the problems facing society, then that society would never reach the state of hopelessness and alienation that they considered necessary to provoke a socialist revolution. Their task, therefore, was as swiftly as possible to undermine the “Judaeo-Christian legacy.”
           </p>
           <p>
            FRANKFURT SCHOOL: RIDING THE GOAT
           </p>
           <p>
            “One of the main ideas of the Frankfurt School was to exploit Freud’s idea of “PANSEXUALISM”: the search for indiscriminate sexual pleasure, the promotion of “unisex”, the blurring of distinctions between the sexes, the overthrowing of traditional relationships between men and women, and, finally, the undermining of heterosexuality at the expense of homosexuality — as, for example, in the idea of “same-sex marriage” and the adoption of children by homosexual couples.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Under the growing influence of Christianity around the first century AD, the pagan Sun Cults of Mithras were essentially outlawed and driven underground. Powerful forces of the secret pagan sun cults like the Frankfurt School have been committed to effecting an erosion and destruction of Christianity and its influence, from within. As they erode Christianity, the underground and outlawed Sun Cults of Mithras are arising dropping their veils of secular disguise to become the explicit and open worship of the Cybele, Mithra, and Satan-Baal-Lucifer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Powerful institutions, academic universities, oligarchies, and now the U.S. government is bent upon eradicating the kind of institutional forms of society which Christianity and true human nature demand and require of the divine. The persistent erosion of society’s core Christian values open people of weak character and constitution to be recruited, and victims including children to be kidnapped, ritually abused, brainwashed and mind controlled to act as a force for EVIL, a form of evil like the ancient Phrygian Cult of Cybele-Dionysus.
           </p>
           <p>
            The spread of explicit Satanism, through aid and conspiracy of agencies such as Adorno’s Frankfurt School and Tavistock Institute, and their dogmas of “the authoritarian personality” creates clouds of a dark age, and phase of large scale mass organizing and indoctrination in the U.S. Adorno and his Frankfurt School mentor, Arnold Schoenberg, have been identified as these types of clandestine Pan-sexual  SATANISTS, and Kabbalahist Jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to THE SATANIC THEOLOGY BEHIND CULTURAL MARXISM, these type of Kabbalistic Jews believe that God was shattered by the act of Creation, and that His attributes lay as “holy sparks” embedded in Creation which must be picked up in order for Him to be restored to oneness (known as the act of tikkun). The Kabbalahists therefore believes that the Jewish Messiah will never arrive and thus Mankind will never be liberated until God is restored to oneness. The way to do this, according to the Kabbalahists, is to engage in acts of holiness and meditation in order to retrieve the sparks of God.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the year 1666, a cabbalist and occultist named Sabbatai Zevi declared himself the Jewish Messiah. Upon his messiahship, he turned the Torah around by declaring that all sins were now considered “holy” and that the only way to “repair” God was to engage in acts of depravity. He lost several followers after the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire forced him to convert to Islam, however, several Jews still followed him. 100 years later, Jacob Frank declared himself to be the reincarnation of Sabbatai Zevi and took those ideas to an even more extreme level.
           </p>
           <p>
            In order for God to be fully repaired and for the Messianic Era to arrive, mankind must destroy all of its traditional moral values and go beyond good and evil. The Frankists, as they were called, engaged in every horrible thing you could imagine: black magic, wife-swapping, sex orgies, homosexuality, incest, pedophilia, and promoted a form of proto-feminism and proto-communism. Every one of these disgusting acts was considered to be a “holy tikkun” (restoration) of God if done with holy intent. They were entirely apocalyptic who despised the world of creation, seeking to bring about its early end and to bring forth a Messianic utopia.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Sabbatean and Frankist heresies established a stronghold in Frankfurt, Germany. These Frankists were known to be affiliated with the Freemasonic lodges that existed around the city. One such Freemason was a man by the name of Franz Joseph Molitor. He was a known Satanist and alchemist who took a strong interest in the Kabbalah, even going so far as to synthesize Kabbalah with a perverted form of “Christianity.” This is what lead him to picking up Sabbatean-Frankist ideology. In order to promote his sick and twisted views, he wrote a four-volume set of books promoting a bastardized understanding of “Judaism” written from a cabbalist and Sabbatean perspective. Both Adorno and Schoenberg were secret Frankfurt and Tavistock “Satanic-Kabbalistic Music  Masters”.
           </p>
           <p>
            The CIA MK-ULTRA program was also interested in profiling personalities- work that the Frankfurt School had been concentrating on for the US Government since the final years of the war. In the late 1930’s, the Tavistock Institute developed a symbiotic relationship with the Frankfurt Institute for Social Research. Their collaboration led them to analyze the culture of a population from a neo-Freudian standpoint. Nazism just happened to be one of its patients on the psychiatric couch.[30] Both Tavistock and the Frankfurt School paid close attention to Nazi propaganda techniques, which they willingly incorporated into their research. The aim of the project, as stated in (Theodore) Adorno’s “Introduction to the Sociology of Music, ” … was to “program a mass culture as a form of extensive social control that would steadily degrade its consumers.”[31]
           </p>
           <p>
            “MK-ULTRA teams tried to map out the beliefs and insecurities of certain ethnic groups, like Blacks; and social groups, like lower-class inner-city residents; and religious groups like Evangelical Christians. They were building a database of how to manipulate ethnic politics and special interest groups.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The Tavistock and Frankfurter “inner circle” of thinkers, social scientists, and philosophers, etc., were also recruited into the CIA and Tom Dowd belonged to a very select group that had all the necessary security clearances to be exposed and recruited to assist the secret and classified type of work that the Frankfurters were doing secretly through CIA MK ULTRA/MONARCH, and the US government to clandestinely mass manipulate and control the minds of the masses through the arts for a New World Order.

            I KNEW there had to be some real dirt on these BAMN bastards especially considering their so openly Marxist. I've never seen one example from any marxist ideologist that isn't as transparent and shallow as a ghost and every since marxist communism was invented by the international bankers it has been NOTHING but a convenient hiding place for members of the satanic cult. The bolshevik revolution and the elimination of the czars and millions of christian lives later the scourge is still spreading from the eastern block in an orchestrated takeover. Communism has only been being implemented in the world because they have found out it is the form of slavery that works best for them because they can eliminate any opposition at will. Fuck these trotskyite prostitutes and pedophiles straight to fucking hell.

            This article and thread cannot be Upvoated enough.  This is a VERY PROMINENT DEVELOPMENT and,  along with a few other key points about these organizations,  like Antifa and Bamn,  along with the silsby,  hijazi,  COMET PIZZA episodes...
           </p>
           <p>
            HIGHLY ILLUSTRATES THE ENTIRE MODUS OPERANDI OF THE CULT,  A CULTURAL MARXIST TAKEOVER OF THE YOUTH TO SLOWLY INCULCATE THEM INTO FAR LEFT LIBERAL IDEOLOGIES,  BRAINWASHING AND TERRORISM.
           </p>
           <p>
            THE PEDOPHILIA ANGLE ONLY REINFORCES EVERY CONSPIRACY THEORY WE'VE EVER HEARD ABOUT HOW THEY NEED TO GET THEIR HANDS ON THE  CHILDREN YOUNG TO USE THEM AS CURRENCY,  SEX SLAVES,  MANCHURIAN CANDIDATES AND RITUAL VICTIMS.
           </p>
           <p>
            THIS IS JUST ANOTHER VICTORY THAT INDICATES SOMETHING HUGE LURKING IN THE UNDERBELLY OF COMET PING PONG AND PIZZA,  OUR CAPITOL,  AND THE WORLD.

            I was hoping someone would post this. I don't have the link at hand but a few years ago on FB a guy who escaped the cult of BAMN (which I'd never even heard of until recently) and he described behavior that very much appears to be human trafficking in that they are luring kids from Michigan to California to indoctrinate them into this insanity. He said they specifically target gay black youths from either troubled homes. The two leaders of this org and the speakers listed in this article for NAMBLA need to be more heavily researched for who they have political ties to.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit to add: George Webb has some tie ins with Michigan and the rat lines.

            You know what's funny (not funny at all actually) is you could show this descriptive piece to the lunatics on the left and THEY STILL WON'T GET IT. It will be derided as fake news click bait Trumpanzee propaganda. I've never been ashamed to be left handed until recently

             I'm not trying to state my personal views on lifestyle choices here, just an observation of the tactics of the pedo-normalization poeple: Any movement that seeks to normalize sexuality that society (at least at that time) deems abnormal, pedos jump on board. When "gay rights" started to get big through the 70s, to today, you started to notice pedos infesting their movements. So much so that a lot of people started to associate gays with pedos and the gays started to get uncomfortable.  Now you're seeing the same thing all over again. It's no surprise at this point.

              Great observation +10. I've associated pedos leaning towards being homos but I admit it could be false.

            Violent Communism is the perfect platform for molesters to tear down the system that that they see as their enemy. I really believe that the defending multi genders carp is really being used as a ploy to get child molestation legalized. They came so close under Obama. Now they don't have any other options but violent threats to keep pushing their evil.

              WOWZA! That's some story ... thanks for the link. It's amazing that these organizations use brainwashing methodology to achieve their goals. Turning a child against their family is a HUGE deal. The org .. gang, really ... becomes your family ... pseudo famil. Psychologically, it's a big deal in what this gang has in your life. If you have a family and are a member of a gang, it's one thing, but when this gang IS your family, you're easier to control and it takes on a whole 'nother flavor. Horrible that this is allowed to go on. And I love that the police believed them. No they did not! They were WORKING for them ... are working for them. They know exactly what's going on, but they were given their marching orders.

                I'm sure. There should be statistics as to how many times this happens, but I doubt they're kept. It probably only counts as the child running away voluntarily and returning home.

                    I'm getting my comments confused here ... :) What I tried to do was address how statistics of missing children were kept. In other words, if a group deceive a child and held them by either peer pressure or intimidation, and the child escaped and came home, it would be recorded as the child "voluntarily" running way and "voluntarily" coming home when that's not really the case. That's all.

                      Yes, and that makes it hard to track. If they tracked it, you'd have stats saying that (THE NAME OF THE ORGANIZATION) manipulated/coerced underage children (THIS MANY TIMES) to leave home and that the child escaped after being held for (THIS NUMBER OF YEARS).

                 It is kinda scary. Day after this stuff comes out of antifa trafficking runaways, we find out they are connected with pedos. Deep connections.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The good news is this is a huge break: we now have a documented connection between a lot of politicians and pedos thanks to their public antifa support.
                </p>
                <p>
                 things are making a lot of sense now. The berkly mayor supports antifa through bamn, and Berkeley has a human trafficking issues, we even know that they mayor has pull over the police. Things are making sense now.

                  And the other HUGE connection is that it's another college involved with pedophilia. Penn State and now Berkeley.

                   Pedos use indoctrinated "sex positive" kids to traffic vulnerable kids, vulnerable kids get taken to places where they can not get out, and are manipulated into protesting. The protests are a cover for the sexual abuse. If they get caught, then they can claim that the sex abuse charges are made up as a means to silence political dissent.

                   Clever bastards. This would have worked in the pre internet era. They will get away with it too if those meddling autists don't work fast enough.

                   A good place to start, is with state newspapers in Pennsylvania. This is a conservative state, and if we can spread this around that a liberal group tied to pedophilia has connections with the state flagship school, this will force an in state criminal investigation. Something that will be very hard to cover up.

                    Well, Penn State and Sandusky were covered up for years, so something is going on. And in a conservative state, it's surprising, but not impossible.

                     Pre internet coverups where very easy. there was a monopoly on information, and a limited amount of time to get it all. the only way to get it was either by buying a newspaper, magazine, or watching the news.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Now an anonymous message board mobilizes information and people far faster than anything in the past. There is also a level of involvement that was not seen before.
