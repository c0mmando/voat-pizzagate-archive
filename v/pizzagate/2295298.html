<p>These posts are relevant to pizzagate because they discuss Marina Abramovic, who was a central figure in that scandal. </p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;Gurdjieff\'s methods are linked to many aspects of ritual abuse - including topics I\'ve previously written about - for example Findhorn and Esalen. I wrote about those campuses specifically in relation to the ongoing investigation of RA Anon\'s experience.</p>
<p>Gurdjieff is directly linked to Marina Abramovic, as well as Bartlesville. His \'Fourth Way\' is intimately tied to the development of Abramovic\'s \'Method\' and her \'spirit cooking\' via Abramovic\'s repeated description of Gurdjieff as her spiritual &quot;father.&quot; The common denominator between Abramovic\'s Method and Gurdjieff\'s Fourth Way is the use of the body, body movement, and physical experience as a medium for &quot;spiritual development&quot; /mental and emotional change and altered states.</p>
<p>Gurdjieff\'s \'Fourth Way\' can accurately be described as a literal predecessor to Abramovic\'s sprit cooking and ritualistic, bloody practices. Many individuals tied to Gurdjieff (Idries Sha, John G Bennet) are also linked to Tavistock and intelligence agencies in both the UK and the US.</p>
<p>Images of Gurdjieff\'s &quot;movements&quot; are depicted below. They are important because Gurdjieff\'s use of the body as a medium of experience here is intimately comparable with Abramovic\'s use of the body as medium.</p>
<p>Abramovic directly described this in press interviews, which mirror Gurdjieff\'s work almost exactly.</p>
<p>Gurdjieff\'s Fourth Way was primarily designed to shock his followers out of their normal state of consciousness which he likened to sleep. This is identical to the description of Abramovic\'s Method. What this illustrates is the process of intentionally inducing traumatic shock in viewers in order to take advantage of the impressionable, vulnerable state it creates.</p>
<p>The concept of body-as-medium is a critical aspect of ritual abuse. The mind is not accessed directly. Instead, the deeper subconscious is targeted. This bodily experience ultimately controls the formation of the mind without conscious knowledge of the individual affected, especially in childhood.</p>
<p>As Skinner described in terms of operant conditioning, the strongest control is gained when the deeper subconscious is accessed. This emotional experience lives in the body and it is in the body that memory can be imprinted. Any PTSD survivor will understand the physical aspect of being triggered. It is not a purely mental or even emotional experience, but a physical one. Even those who have experienced a bad break up will understand the physical aspect of strong emotions.</p>
<p>Through the body, the strongest aspect of imprinting takes place, and it is through the body that an experience of non-thinking can occur. This connection to non-thinking or the deep subconscious is not particularly negative. Horse riding, surfing, running, meditation and other practices can similarly bring one to this state, but ritual abuse uses this tool for a traumatic purpose.</p>
<p>The physical experience during these types of activities is also related to ancient practices of shamanism and trance. This is why the dancing at Findhorn(which tied to Svetlana Bakushina) is such a critical topic. This is the point to look for when researching ritual abuse: Dance, massage, and \'bodywork\' - like the practices of massage and \'Watsu\' at Harbin, Esalen, and The Haven. Again the concept of bodywork is not in itself negative, but is used at the heart of ritual abuse.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Additional methods of accessing the self via physicality include sensory deprivation through blindfolding, which is seen in Abramovic\'s work through her institute. Blindfolding performed by Abramovic and her cohorts like Hermann Nitsch are extremely important because these acts are directly comparable to the sensory deprivation documented to have occurred during the officially confirmed MKULTRA experiments performed by the monstrous Ewen Cameron, and even under associates of Esalen such as John Lilly.Sensory deprivation is not in and of itself a harmful technique. It does allow access to a deep meditative state through the body, just as dance and other types of physical ritual/activities do. However, it also becomes an extremely powerful tool for mind control, because it allows programming to take place at the deepest level of a person\'s being. Sensory deprivation is the most basic example of programming the mind/self via the experience of the body.</p>
<p>John C. Lilly developed flotation tanks. Lilly\'s involvement with the MKULTRA program is debated, but he was definitely active at locations including Esalen, NIMH, and others.</p>
<p>Lilly\'s experiments with drugs like Ketamine during sensory deprivation were the basis for the film &quot;Altered States.&quot; Rolling Stone also references Lilly as an important influence on the TV show \'Stranger Things,\' which depicts a fictionalized and idealized version of the MKULTRA program.</p>
<p>Some press has explicitly noted that the sensory deprivation shown in Stranger Things is &quot;not far off from reality.&quot;</p>
<p>Lilly also knew Oscar Ichazo, the Chilean who created the mystical school Arica - which is also apparently based to some extent on Gurdjieff\'s Fourth Way teachings, describing human beings as controlled by automatic/mechanistic behavior patterns.</p>
<p>Jesuit priests eventually adopted Ichazo\'s version of the Enneagram for use in Christian spirituality. The use of Enneagrams by Oscar Ichazo forms an additional bridge between the esoteric \'left hand path\' teachings of Gurdjieff and a military-tied scientist studying brain activity and sensory deprivation in MKULTRA style projects. Such connections provide an example of the influence occultists have had not only on the study of the human mind but also the techniques which are used to fragment it.</p>
<p>Ichazo\'s Arica school is known as a variation of the Human Potential Movement. I have previously hypothesized was a euphemism for the study of mind control through the induction of multiple personality disorder and dissociation. This is particularly interesting because it links a possible MKULTRA group in California with the variety of ancient indigenous practices that I discuss in previous articles. These traditions center on techniques of inducing altered bodily states that result in possession - an ancient description of multiple personality disorder or extreme dissociation. Ichazo also &quot;insisted on secrecy.&quot;</p>
<p>Ichazo\'s acolyte Claudio Naranjo was also a member of Gestalt groups centered in the Human Potential movement. Naranjo apparently became an &quot;apprentice of Fritz Perls and part of the early Gestalt Therapy community, where he began conducting workshops at Esalen Institute as a visiting associate. He eventually became one of Perls\' three successors, along with Jack Downing and Robert Hall.&quot; He is described as a &quot;a key figure at Esalen.&quot;</p>
<p>Further, Naranjo was &quot;a consultant for the Education Policy Research Center, created by Willis Harman at Stanford Research Institute.&quot; The Stanford Research Institute is notorious for its involvement in MKULTRA type programs, much like its British cousin, the Tavistock Institute.</p>
<p>Willis Harman: &quot; taught for several years at the University of Florida before joining the Stanford faculty in 1952.[2] He eventually left Stanford to become a senior social scientist at SRI International where he initiated a futures research program, exploring the national and global future. In this capacity he worked on long-term strategic planning and policy analysis for an assortment of corporations, government agencies, and international organizations.[4] He then served as president of the Institute of Noetic Sciences from 1975 until his death in 1997.&quot;</p>
<p>The Institute of Noetic Sciences researches parapsychology, most likely in tandem with government interest in the subject as described by MKULTRA nad ritual abuse survivors. The group was co-founded by Astronaut Edgar Mitchell. The Institute\'s studies in parapsychology include interest in yoga and other bodily methods of accessing the subconscious/ alleged psychic abilities.</p>
<p>&quot;The Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) is an American non-profit parapsychological[1] research institute. It was co-founded in 1973 by former astronaut Edgar Mitchell,[2][3][4] along with investor Paul N. Temple,[5][dead link] and others interested in purported paranormal phenomena,[1] in order to encourage and conduct research on noetic theory and human potentials.[6][7]&quot;</p>
<p>The institute conducts research on such topics such as spontaneous remission,[8][9] meditation,[8] consciousness, alternative healing practices, consciousness-based healthcare, spirituality, human potential, psychic abilities, psychokinesis[9] and survival of consciousness after bodily death.[10][11] &quot;</p>

           <p>
            I highly recommend reading OP's post on Marina Abramovic's travels to Brazil and how her work was inspired by shamanic practices she got to know there:

            really well researched and i am familiar with Esalen which appeared for years as this 'good' New Age mind enhancer kind of place.I have alway wondered about the connections between the occult and say, what went on at the Mother of darkness castle and say, good old American-Canadian KMULTRA programming.  We all know about Michael Aqiuno  and his OTO in conjunction with military programs but i wonder about the EVILS of say a luciferian sacrifice and then the traumatizing of children for what these sickos consider the greater good, i.e. making a mind control slave. One more thing, much is written about American -Canadian programs but about say France. The original film, La Femme Nikita was really just a wink wink, nudge nudge alluding to programming (albeit leaving out the fact that Nikita was not brought into section as a teenager but much more likely as a very young child). She was considered a delinquent so the film tried to justify that it was okay to program her?? Anyway, thoughts on the programs in say France. Any information?

            Excuse the extra reply, but, just wanted to thank you for posting this thread, 9217.

            The information in your main post and in the comments, is
            <strong>
             incredibly valuable
            </strong>
            in the grand scheme of pizzagate and global corruption - especially with regards to mass-hysteria, trauma-facilitated complacency/memory-loss and the generational survival of superstition/triggers, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have a feeling something even bigger is coming down the line, which will tie directly in to what's being discussed here.

            But we already know this. What you don't know is that it's for remote control which is why people claim to feel possessed, watching themselves do things. It's not always an alter or split, it's actual possession and control through waking sleep.

            we need to start talking about time "zones" and "states" of mind.

              The US govt. issued lone assassin phenomenon.....Programmed to Kill by Dave McGowan goes into a couple of stages of this govt. program, how they are chosen and how the killings are staged..by more than one person...but only one is given the distinction of being the killer. Govt. looks for violent tendencies , mental illness and an abusive family life...guess it cuts down on their training period.i.e.G bush Jr. , as governor of Texas only pardoned one person. A sadistic serial killer. ..probably a family favorite.

               McGowan’s books are filled with shocking facts and important information that is relevant. He has another writing, a blog series that details the laurel canyon Hollywood stsanism/murder/drugs culture. Both are essential reading for anyone here on p-gate goat, IMO.

            Yes! It all relates together. Their is a psychological state that abusers are trying to reach in their victims. In anthropology they call it liminality.

           <p>
            re mk ultra they are supposedly looking for a specific type of person that has the necessary intelligence and personality to 'dissociate'. People that can dissociate can be molded by programmers into having split personalities that can be activated by things like imagery, smell, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            So imagine you have a systematic process for esentially creating slaves that might go something along these lines:
1. abuse children to see if they have the ability to 'dissociate'
2. program children that can dissociate via ritualized abuse to do what 'they' want. Wipe their memories with drugs.
3. release them into society and support their career rise, trigger split personality when triggered
4. damage control and reprogramming when they fall apart psychologically

             While Liminality is a
             <strong>
              very
             </strong>
             interesting topic and in many ways relevant - there's no direct correlation between it and sexual abuse/mind control.
            </p>
            <p>
             The dissociative state you speak of, however, is definitely something sought by abusers and those who seek to enslave - indeed, many a systematic approach exists for such corruption. I'd go into more detail but I'm heading to bed soon.

              appreciate the reply. I guess what I was suggessting is that liminal states in combination with what the west would call sexual abuse have often been used to heighten the liminality. Here are some docs:

              <em>
               I'm sure there are other examples, but the above was from a brief search
              </em>
             </p>
             <p>
              The idea is that sexual abuse may serve a psychological function, and not just be about the pedo being a pedo. Is there a network doing this?

               I know the example re: Papua New Guinea is random, but some of those cultures also practice ritual cannibalism.

                Then of course you have the incans who apparently drugged the people sacrificed before they sacrificed them.

               <p>
                The incan case is interesting because they had a separate language that they used only for rituals, and a form of it is still spoken today in Bolivia and Peru as Quechua. There was Aymara, which is also still spoken in parts of Bolivia and Peru. Aymara was the common language and Quechua was the ceremonial language. Then Quechua spread out to the masses and became spoken by them. Imagine that, having a whole separate language just for performing rituals. They really perfected their ability to get ppl into liminal states.

In every case, the 42 children, mostly males aged around six, were suffering from serious cavities, abscesses or bone infections that would have been painful enough to make them cry continually. Tlaloc required the tears of the young so their tears would wet the earth. As a result, if children did not cry, the priests would sometimes tear off the children's nails before the ritual sacrifice.[7]"

                 I see ^^ that as somehow related to the possible extraction of Adrenochrome in modern cults/organized child abuse rings - if what Hunter Thompson described is actually a thing, and I don't know if it is or not, but Thompson was accused of involvement in the Franklin Scandal by Paul Bonnaci and Ted Gunderson also thought he was involved in snuff/etc.

                   Wouldn't necessarily use the word demon myself, but, essentially yes - it's all the same depravity/delusion/corruption, unfortunately so often attributed to other deities/archetypes over time.

                  I've heard that families with a long line of abuse would have the highest likelihood of being able to 'dissociate' , so they would be the best candidates for mind control experiements and whathaveya.

                   I'll admit, I was unsure about you at first(given the recent submissions from you), but, you do seem to know what you're talking about. Thanks for sharing the Liminality and Epigenetics links - with both put into the context of ritualistic sexual abuse and mind control, it becomes possible to explain how triggers, split personalities and deceptive falsehoods, can be programmed into the victim(s).

            The Enneagram thing has been specifically called out by the Catholic Church as something not to engage in.  If anybody is still promoting that, they’re going against church teaching.  I know it was something that crept in for a while, but it’s not allowed.  In fact, Catholicism categorically rejects anything that can even be thought of as New Age.
           </p>

            There some good reading on it here:

           <p>
            Not saying abuses don’t happen.  It’s not church doctrine.

             Absolutely, and I thought it was interesting that specifically Jesuits were involved in that instance, but wasn't intending to make any larger statement about the Catholic church.
