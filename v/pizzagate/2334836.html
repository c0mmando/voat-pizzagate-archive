            This is a norm now in countries like Germany and France with rape gangs from the Middle East and North Africa. Yet the media acts as if they're suffering children when they are mostly men in their 20s. Eastern Europe excluding Russia has much more sense regarding this issue.

            I have relatives in Germany.  Don't really keep in touch.  I was born in Austria where suspects are also involved.  Shame Shame Shame  :(  I cannot even express my Shame.  Here is what Must Stop:  None of the suspects' names have been released under Germany's strict privacy laws.  SCREW THEIR PRIVACY LAWS.

            What is with this apologist shite worldwide with these offenders? Why ask IF THEY CAN LEARN NOT TO OFFEND...Fuuuuck if you are doing this and profiting off of this WITH YOUR OWN CHILD...Logic tells me the answer is an astounding hell no. There should be a final SOULlution to the pedo problem and it shouldnt include asking questions about recovery. Geeezuss!! We dont ask if killers will stop murdering and at least those victims dont have to live through seeing their perp WALK FREE  because of dumb shite like "he was suffering with cancer so he offended" WTF...sorry I am seriously chapped!!

             Usually child rapists don't stop committing their horrible crimes. And even so, who cares whether they will repeat or not? If they hurt a child, they pay the price. Despite years of jew indoctrination the fact remains that, no, the point of punishment for serious crimes is not to rehabilitate a criminal (who even wants to give a pedo a second chance, wtf), but inflict a severe penalty and render justice. It is state sponsored revenge on behalf of the victim. If the state doesn't punish, vigilantes will eventually take matters into their own hands and a "state" ceases to be a functional state at all (which is of course their very goal). And anyway, from a purely practical reason, pests need to be coolly exterminated lest they cause more damage.

            These people lack something that makes them human. There is no cure for that. Life isn't an option for a kid that abused like that, they have stolen their life. These people need to be locked up for life &amp; pay their way through work in prison. Make them do data entry 16 hours a day for rest of their life.

             I wish someone could expose my abusers. The law isn’t doing such a great job.. I’ve reported and reported. I know they believe me.. or they wouldn’t take their time to drive 4 hours to talk to me... I have an email from the Philadelphia district attorneys office asking for any and all information and???

            <p>
             I spoke with my RA psychologist yesterday. I told her about what you are doing here. She believes all this will be exposed as the public is sick of coverups. I just hope I live to see it
            </p>
            <p>
             Thank you all for trying!!

              I'm so sorry that happened to you. You were innocent and blameless and deserved to loved in an innocent way. You can bring your understanding to help others now because of it.  It will come out more and more, there are a lot of people working on it. &lt;3

            Disgusting! They need to be put in front of a firing squad.  I have been to Germany a few times when my husband worked there and am not surprised at all that this goes on.  I was shocked at the depravity on display in some shops, felt dirty just walking past them, porn seems normal there and especially their tv is disgusting.  At least we have the 'watershed' (which is supposed to be anything adult themed after 9pm-thought its slipping these days) anyway, I was watching a program about some country detective (was in German so could not understand what was being said) when there is NO warning they are going to a commercial break and a nude man comes riding a bike through a path in a field.  I was, whats the heck has this got to do with the detective program I was watching? I didn't realise it was an advert as it blended in with the country/field theme of the programme.  Only when the writing for some product came up did I realise it was not part of the programme! - The Germans are far to open and liberal for my taste, goodness knows what the children grow up in.  It's a shame no wonder the world is a mess.

             Yes, KILL ALL PEDOS ! Fucking liberals want to preach 'rehab' that DOESN'T WORK! Death..that works! Science will prove us right; Pedophiles are a race - with unique DNA from us. Logic would suggest that you cannot 'rehab' DNA out of the human cells! Liberals want the state to take care of them, but as we already know the state is working hand and hand with the Pedophiles.Making $$$ off the rape and torture of kids. If you kill the pedophile you solve most of the problem. You have sex offender registry at your disposal,use it! Find the Pedo, Hunt the Pedo,Kill the Pedo.

              Hell, any "Dangan Ronpa Style" punishment would fit. Just has to fit the criteria of "irony based on the person in question + shit tons of black comedy".

               I am with you.  Any most horrid punishment we can come up with is still too good for these perverted scums.  I am usually not in favor of capitol punishment but with pedos nothing is too heinous!

             A GERMAN TAMARA LUZZATTO
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            German authorities have uncovered a pedophile ring that involved a mother selling her nine-year-old son to men over the internet. One of the suspects includes a member of Germany's armed forces.
           </p>
           <p>
            German police on Thursday released harrowing details of a pedophile ring that saw a 47-year-old mother and her partner repeatedly sexually abuse her son and make him available for rape in exchange for money.
Authorities arrested the mother and her 37-year-old partner, a previously convicted pedophile, back in September in the city of Freiburg in southwestern Germany, where most of the acts are also reported to have taken place over two years.

Six suspects who also allegedly abused the boy have also been taken into custody, among them a German soldier based with the Franco-German brigade in Alsace. A Swiss and a Spanish national, both residing in Austria, were also detained, as was a German man who had previously spoken of his urge to carry out violent acts on children. He was caught with a pair of handcuffs in his backpack.
None of the suspects' names have been released under Germany's strict privacy laws.
           </p>
           <p>
            Police stunned
"I don't remember a comparable case of this dimension in [the state of] Baden-Württemberg," said State Criminal Police spokesman Horst Haug.
Authorities were made aware of the pedophile ring in September 2017 through an anonymous tip-off. Five days later, the mother and her partner were detained and the child was taken into state custody.
           </p>
           <p>
            During the investigation, however, police discovered that the two had also abused and raped the boy themselves.
Police declined to say on Thursday what the other suspects had told them or whether they had even confessed to the crimes. "They are providing some information," said Attorney General Michael Mächt, without going into further detail.

Given the scope of the investigation, police wanted to avoid drawing obvious comparisons between this and a previous case from 2001 that took place Saarland. That incident saw a boy known as Pascal held in the back room of a bar, where he was abused by various perpetrators. The suspects were acquitted, however, after they were found to be mentally unstable due to alcohol abuse.
The boy, meanwhile, has been missing since 2001 and is presumed to have been murdered.
