<em>•	You took out of context and used this quote to cement the BASELESS suggestion that the march is a False Flag Operation.  Would love to hear the justification of that one.  Fake News.</em></p>
<p><strong>From what I can tell, Mr. Gallant is a decent guy who simply couldn\'t sit on his hands anymore. I am not trying to throw shade on his character</strong>. </p>
<p>*•	You’re not trying to throw shade, that’s true.  You’re trying to wholly discredit.<br />
•	And not only wholly discredit, but discredit with prejudice.
•	“Armed resistance” – “false flag” – “rain down mayhem”. * </p>
<p><strong>I DO wish to remind people of the big picture:</strong></p>
<p><em>•	Please do… and many thanks.... because we dumb monkeys forget that shit only a daily basis…. So please, strike us with awe as you play Captain Obvious with your bullet-point reminders:</em></p>
<p>**    The Clinton Cabal and Soros-funded Antifa have a history of manipulating rallies in order to incite violence**</p>
<p><em>•	Let us all know when you have the document supporting the fact that any of this known treachery has targeted a Pizzagate or march on CPP event. 
•	Underscore that fear-factor…. Bring it all home… convince us.</em></p>
<p>**    The Comet Ping Pong shooter was likely a false flag,** </p>
<p><em>•	No scenario is more likely</em>.</p>
<p><strong>and we are again in &quot;flag weather&quot; according to supposed insiders</strong></p>
<p><em>•	Bring it all full circle for us…. That hard-hitting closing statement you want us all to buy into… roll it out…</em></p>
<p>**    That incident has been used to debunk and suppress the pizzagate investigation ever since**</p>
<p><em>•	There it is… and boy, what a doozey… 
•	“Used to debunk” – When has pizzagate ever been debunked?<br />
•	“and suppress” – Has it been suppressed more since the fake shooting?  Because it looks like it backfired and the movement to expose pizzagate is stronger than ever.<br />
•	So, why would you be pushing a narrative that results in Debunked and Supressed?  What could you gain from doing that?</em>  
</p>
<p>**    The violence-loving deep state operatives who we believe started and maintain the trafficking rings are skilled manipulators capable of LARPing on made up sites, any of the sites we use as sources, or fooling the investigators who run them.**</p>
<p><em>•	Is this about Titus Frost saying he gave CPP child porn to the DC cops? 
•	Oh wait, this is you saying the deep state is smarter than we the People, so smart that they’re going to create a fake, low-publicity, non-tech savvy, fully grass-roots operation to conduct a major false flag operation that will lead to Pizzagate being suppressed or debunked…. Ok.
•	Except – you’re wrong.  That’s why they’re the ones whose necks are on the line, and we the People are the ones exposing them.  Our deep state is deeper than their deep state, and every sincere Pizzagate truther knows that; so, what’s your excuse?</em></p>
<p>**Then there was this language, also in the permit:</p>
<pre><code>I, Erik Gallant of Jackson MI, aided by a handful of dedicated others, have been the hub of this movement of concerned citizens from all over the U.S. and abroad who have pitched in their efforts to make this demonstration a reality, working hard day and night pushing our campaign on various online platforms**
</code></pre>

<p><em>•	All factual.  Erik organized a small group of folks from the US and abroad, who got together and made this march happen.  What’s the problem?</em>
 **
Given the emphasis on himself, his requests for money, his cool looking but dangerous imagery and melodramatic organization name (superheroes like the Justice LeagueJPG?)** </p>
<p><em>•	“Emphasis on himself”… it’s a statement from him, regarding himself…. So yeah, it’s going to have to mention him and explain his relationship to the permit and event.
•	Along with… “a handful of others” across the US and abroad… who have been working (mostly independently of voat) to spread Pizzagate truth and awareness, and who organized support enough among others, to move forward with the demonstration… There’s nothing wrong with it and it isn’t self-glorifying anywhere except your imagination.
•	“Dangerous imagery” and “melodramatic organization name”…. (mod-narrative version scary music plays in the background and conjures up fears of conflict and censure)
•	and of course, “Money” (since no demonstration should ever need money for anything.  If the port-a-potty budget runs dry, then so be it – right?)</em></p>
<p><strong>I am not confident Mr. Gallant would necessarily recognize if he were being manipulated.</strong></p>
<p><em>•	Because no dumb monkey could possibly be as smart or lucky as someone like you, could he?
•	I received a similar eloquent response in the “possible false flag” discussion.<br />
•	Too bad we little chimps aren’t up the “newspaper of record” eugenic, elite mental threshold of the great and powerful Modz</em>.  
</p>
<p><strong>Imagine the effect of turning this rally into a Berkeley-type riot.</strong> </p>
<p><em>•	Sounds like one of your …dreams now that I’ve read the narrative propaganda</em>.</p>
<p><strong>It would not only impact March 18, it would likely completely shut down the originally planned rally on March 25. Were we to advertise it here, we might subject Voat and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a> to increased vulnerability to censorship through legal action.</strong></p>
<p>*•	So… we arrive back at the original, simple answer of Legal Risk, now all snug and sufficiently swaddled in Fear… with the fake narrative cherry on top:  that this dangerous, melodramatic, confrontational, frustrated mob of protestors – who can’t control themselves in public, and can’t tell troublemakers from friends – is going to singlehandedly be the cause of traitorous evils galore, involving everything from the 2nd march getting cancelled, up to and including the entire sub getting shut down, all the way to another media-fest slander scandal involving guns and an explosive false flag – ultimately permanently destroying any credibility the Pizzagate investigation currently has.  
</p>
<p>•	To the united in the Pizzagate truth movement, friends… Beware the attempts to promote a narrative of any kind.  The only narrative needed is the truth.*</p>',

            can't upvoat this enough! on one hand i'm extraordinarily frustrated by the people on here (mods, etc) who are trying to push a narrative and guide us by our little hands bc they somehow know far more than us little people could ever hope to understand. i fear that their tactics work on voaters rather than just be annoying noise that we need to learn to ignore and work around. on the other hand, i'm glad for it bc it makes it quite obvious who the shills are. i.e. the people to ignore now and in the future. not just the user names, either, since many have different accounts, but their message, their tactic, and their attitude. once you learn their MO, they are easy to spot. and a major red flag is anyone or anything who tries to muzzle the truth of the situation, regardless of whatever lame excuse they come up with.
           </p>
           <p>
            as far as protests are concerned, i really hope that those of us truly concerned about the situation don't believe that we need some complicated, iron-clad, multi-tiered presentation to prove the legitimacy of our presence. protests are about awareness. one sign among a group of silent protesters seen in front of hundreds of people walking past will, quite obviously, make more people aware than...nothing. even 5 people who get tuned into the problem is worth it. bc those 5 people know people. and they will tell those people. and those people will tell their friends and groups. and on and on and on. it's the same concept that makes the MLMs work. the shills know it and so do TPTB that employ them. which is why they want us silenced. which is why they make countless excuses for why we shouldn't protest. bc at this point, public displays are the only thing they can't censor. so they are trying to prevent them before they start.

            In case you wasn't aware, pizzagaters are somewhat sceptical of everything and given the recent false flags (gunman and shill protest of CPP) it was a smart move not to automatically back every random protest.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want to help the movement, keep investigating rather then getting caught up in metadiscussions about  hurt feelings

               the mods were horrible to those nice people who organized that march.... and to add insult to injury have a host of misleading and false info in the sticky... you could research pizzagate until the end of time because the rabbit hole is that deep... but if we all don't stick together instead of spreading lies, fear and division, then the amazing window to see justice done will eventually close.

                I don't support it I understand it. Not to mention supporting the rally can put voat in legal hot water. Voat is just the medium for the pizzagate investigation, Reddit was the previous one &amp; none are perfect.

                 no one should "put up" with false information, misleading suggestions and pushing a narrative of violence... if the mods just put a disclaimer up like normal people, it wouldn't be an issue... and i'm sure if you were the person they singled out to attack when you decided to help spread the word, that you would appreciate an apology... pizzagaters are decent people and there's no reason not to treat each other with that decency.

                <p>
                 i'm not going to sit by and watch falsehoods be spread around without calling them out and i should hope the same for all of us.

             it wasn't.. they were both planned with no knowledge of the other, by two different organizers... when they discovered each other, the folks in the first demonstration had already finalized all their plans and both agreed trying to get everyone to either one of the events wasn't feasible, so they just went on with both.

             it really wasn't... the idea of a march was out there in the community and someone was bound to act on as soon as the weather broke decent enough to be outdoors that long in DC.

            Answer this.  What the fuck is the use of a protest when the average, dumb-downed  American -in--the street has no f'ing clue about any of this?   Subversion is needed to get info to MSM.  Break into  CNN, ABC, NBC, FOX, BBC, and  CBS , say at 10 pm ET on a Wednesday  night, coast-to-coast, with one or two excellent orators with  graphics, whatever it takes to get the f'ing word out.  I don't know how in the hell to do it, but you better believe there are people on our side out there who do know.  Print a newspaper and drop off a bundle at every mini-mart across the country.  We need to get it together.

             if there are large enough peaceful numbers at the WH it will also beg a response from the Head Troll in Charge... his "1st member" dude confirmed the administration is aware of pizzagate in his AMA (across the pond).... they can't ignore the cry of the people and that cry has to start somewhere in public..
            </p>
            <p>
             hopefully the small incident with the organizer for the other march will help cement the reminder that it all needs to be peaceful and productive.

             is one of the volunteers for the March 18th event (the guy Echo Truths is interviewing in the first video).. he's an attorney.. and a nice guy.. it's good to have a nice guy attorney on the side of pizzagate to help approach the atrocities from a legal perspective.

             I like your thinking!  How awesome would that be if the good guys could hack into the networks and blast this out to the public from every single news station. I like your mini mart idea too.  Wondering if we could all pool our money to take out full-page ads in major newspapers across the country ? Something tells me that TPTB would not allow it.  We do need to get it together.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also just wondering… do radio talk shows have this subject blocked?  I have to believe a lot of people have tried to call In.

              I agree completely, but you will have assholes present who will ruin your message.   This topic is so huge, indescribably huge, in 1000 lifetimes could one ever imagine such a thing?  This is why the message delivered  and its presentation should be handled with care and kid gloves.  The old saying will always remain true - One bad apple can spoil the bunch.

              It appears that independent programs are already discussing PG but perhaps more exposure is needed.

            I think the protesters should be apologizing to everyone concerned with PG and human trafficking. You made us all look crazy, violent, and dangerous. Neil got into a physical altercation with someone on camera, and made a big huge scene. He also was using his three large dobermans to intimidate people and chase people down the street. Not only that, but you KNEW that you would have resistance from the public in the area, yet you still decided to scream, yell, and call people names, and arguing with people instead of talking to them. You were also told that it was a terrible idea to protest at Comet, but you STILL DID IT. It is shocking to actually see that you believe this accomplished ANYTHING positive.
           </p>
           <p>
            You did nothing to further the movement. You did not help children. You did not wake anyone up. You did not represent the movement well. You did not get any positive publicity. You did not make us look SANE.

              You made us all look crazy, violent, and dangerous. Neil got into a physical altercation with someone on camera, and made a big huge scene. He also was using his three large dobermans to intimidate people and chase people down the street. Not only that, but you KNEW that you would have resistance from the public in the area, yet you still decided to scream, yell, and call people names, and arguing with people instead of talking to them.

             That was Neil Wolfe, who has nothing to do with the March 18th event.  He is the organizer of the March 25th event.  The organizers of the March 18th event (of which I am not one) and everyone who showed up to stand with them, conducted themselves with decency and peacefulness, handling out pamphlets and explaining the cause.  And they deserve an apology.

             Neil wasn't initially involved with this march and it's obvious nothing would have occurred other than peaceful sharing on information, had Neil not "made a huge scene" (apparently it was incited when someone grabbed his phone).

             Your entire complaint is about Neil Wolfe, who has nothing to do with this post.  Why don't you create a post about Neil Wolfe and spread the fear and loathing narrative in that.

              Neil Wolfe was just the guy that stole the car.

              You can try to explain it away all you like, it still reflects poorly on proponents of PG, which is one of the major reasons that this was a terrible idea. Did you go into Comet Ping Pong and fire an AR-15? No? Do people associate you with someone that went into Comet Ping Pong and fired an AR-15 if you talk about PG? Yes?

              Weird how that works. Why don't you create a thread showing how many people got red pilled after this event, or get a nice list of all of the positive press attention that this protest attracted.

               the organizers of the march today deserve an apology and the sticky should come down.
              </p>
              <p>
               why do you want a sticky that is associating "protest" with "false flag" in any way at all...?  that's not smart planning... do you think if something does, God-forbid, happen, that MSM would be fair about it when mentioning voat... or would they latch on to the fact that a "false flag was the hot topic" there?  why don't you "imagine" that scenario and consider what something that is truly concerning actually looks like.

            Dude, they (we) aren't wrong. Send postcards to everyone. Redpill others and get them to send postcards to everyone. Disorganized public protest makes us look crazy and helps nothing and no one. It actually hurts.

              I just think we need more clear evidence and an organized message. I watched the videos and read the threads. There may have been a few that were enlightened, but I'm afraid it looks too fringe. It's scary to people.

                No, I'm just being honest. It freaks people out. Without concrete evidence, it sounds really weird.

                Don't get me wrong, I know pizza/pedo-gate exists on a powerful and systemic level. It's also nothing new. It's incredibly insidious. A few folks with signs aren't going to change anything. They will just be labeled "fringe".

                 i'm sorry, but it only freaks out people who are afraid to take a decent stand for the truth... we all spread the word where we can day to day but the troll in the WH and the world at large need to see our peaceful solidarity and commitment to getting and investigation and justice.  it has to start somewhere.

                 We should focus on what we do have concrete evidence of: Podesta is using KNOWN pedophile code in copious emails that he has admitted are real emails, and HE HAS NOT EXPLAINED THIS
                </p>
                <p>
                 Secondly we know from FOIA that the DC Police straight up lied about having conducted an investigation into this, and the head of the DC PD is buddies with Alefantis, and protected a child rapist in the past.

                 There are things we know that we should be shoving in their faces and mentioning at every interview, but unfortunately I didn't see some of these obvious red flags and discrepancies mentioned.
