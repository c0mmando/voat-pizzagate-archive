            Just saw this video where they say that in this pop video is the infamous '#killroom'. I do not see it personally, however, it makes me sad, as seeing the girls in these type of cages/metal partitions makes it more realistic in my mind.  I generally try not to think deeper into whats beyond what I see, but this is a disturbing reality.  :'(  - (I agree with Ryan that the real problems are under Pegasus Museum, but then that imo, no hard proof....YET!)

              You dumb shit, the Vatican has influence all over the world. It’s called the Catholic church. The Vatican, London, and DC are all similar in one way. I’ll let you figure that one out on your own.

            I dont believe PGGear frankly.  Maybe they wanted to lure someone there or set up a FF.  I like how NOBODY has investigated it further, if its such a huge dangerous lead.

            You are falsely attributing your post number one to the DDoS attack. The attack was related to the recent discovery of hidden messages in bitcoin blockchain sent from addresses linked to Julian Assange and Wikileaks. The rumor is that it is a dead mans trigger and that you have to decrypt the message and combine it to get the password for one of Julian's insurance files. Apparently it is not the first time it was discovered, last October or December there was a group of people that were working on breaking the password and they stopped replying. Same with next two groups who tried it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I started going through that rabbit hole after the DDoS calmed down (both 4chan and voat was attacked, same like last year when this story broke) and i got threat via pms. Some rumors were that if u type the password, it triggers three letter agency viruses that block you from using your pc and possibly fill it with illegal stuff. The rumor was started by one of the groups investigating it, they were looking for ways to enter the password while avoiding triggering the virus.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many of the threads were scrubbed from 4chan, some are locally saved (there is a
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             /r/conspiracy
            </a>
            thread and i believe my old account still has it linked on
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/conspiracy">
             /v/conspiracy
            </a>
            ).
           </p>
           <p>
            Not saying your story is false, i respect your community and i know that u guys take your time to check your stories.

            Zip of scrubbed 4chan talks, those are older talks that do not exist on archives anymore, completely scrubbed from the internet, i got it from the reddit thread OP above. I suspect it is very important, i have seen only a couple of pages and didnt find anything really useful other then the same stuff that has been posted on /pol/ the same time and the end stage process is missing because they moved to another site that got hacked and database wiped.
           </p>
           <p>
            For anyone finding this very interesting, i was threatened for talking about this previously and i dont recommend anyone trying to break this as it may put u in an unwanted situation. I will not share the link for this file after it expires, i do not want to put myself in any trouble.

                Too much effort to sell a lie, a DDoS on 4chan and voat has to be financed, scrubbing of threads (the threads are not on archive anymore) is too much trouble over a hoax. They like when we bite on hoaxes, even encourage it through shilling. The amount of shills that day, both on 4chan and on voat, was astonishing, never have i seen that much shilling in the past year. I dont understand how those people sleep at night, i would be depressed as fuck.

                 Wiping 4 chan can be done by a few nerds. It's not difficult to push old content off by spamming posts.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Ddos is not difficult nor expensive. It could also be done by nerds larping, or in case its disinfo, it would only take the smallest fraction of their budget to ddos 4chan and voat. Though it feels more like larping to me. If it was disinfo there would actually be some sketchy evidence, not just 'some guy found evidence and went dark'.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This larping should not be used to distract from actual evidence or it will look like disinfo.

             Tavistock developed the CIA
            </p>
            <p>
             The CIA engineered the 1960s via drugs. Tavistock engineered The Beatles. The Beatles promoted Crowley The Movement promoted promiscuity, liberalism and ended in the darkness of The Manson Murders.
            </p>
            <p>
             Timothy Leary wrote "How to wash brains" with Robert Anton Wilson. Timothy Leary is suspected to be CIA and spent time in the same prison as Manson prior to any of the alleged murders.

             The Beatles went to India with Mia Farrow (B- blood), who played the role of Rosemary, in Rosemary's Baby about the birth of the antichrist.

            <p>
             The film was directed to Roman Polanski, his wife is Sharon Tate, who was murdered by the Manson family.
            </p>
            <p>
             Rosemary's Baby was filmed in The Dakota Building, where John Lennon was shot.
            </p>
            <p>
             Henry Kissinger's favourite film is "Chinatown", directed by Roman Polanski.
             <strong>
              It features someone wit the same Mark Of Cain that Madeleine McCann displayed in her photos.
             </strong>
            </p>

                        Yes I get that part. Crowley &amp; Tavistock created the Beatles pushed into the US to wash the brains. Crowley was also part of Adolph H. as well. The long term goal was this mass confusion and loss of moral clarity right?

                     I come from the line of The Sun King.  As passed down from the oracle of Delphi.
The coming apocalypse concerns the nature of matter and man's willingness to give up his humanness for trinkets of materialism and entertainment.  In this, he sacrifices his divinity...  Literally in the hardening of the third eye.

                     Cleopatra called herself ISIS and so her son was the image of Horus to her.  He escaped to India, where Thomas was found learning of Lucifer and the origin of the royal lineage.

                      I wish you could say more. I understand the story of Isis &amp; Horus. Also what you are referring to as the third eye which I believe is the Pineal Gland. This is what was mimicked in trauma induced mind control at Tavistock.

                       <p>
                        But the eye usually means the same…esoteric knowledge that man so desires. This eye represents the passing  into a spiritual world than man has no business entering. It is forbidden because it will deceive and oppress.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        In Genesis 3:5-7  For God doth know..then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as Gods…knowing Good and Evil….And the eyes of them both opened.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The Hebrew word for eyes is not plural but singular so what the serpent said was that their eye would be broadened by knowledge.  Scripture here is not talking about the physical organ but the eye of the soul.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        So for today…opening yourself up or opening your third eye is the same.  It is opening a gate between two worlds.  Meditation is a sure way of accomplishing this opening up of yourself especially through Contemplative prayer.  This is simply meditation masked with Christian terminology. The fear that accompanies entrance into deep meditative levels is there for a reason…it is a warning from God

              Would just comment that it's much more likely that Sharon Tate murders were a false flag operation carried out by military.  Charles Manson was also a very unlikely hippie at age 35 and spent most of his life in prison.   Much more likely is the possibility that he was used.

              Will try to find a link -- Mae Brussel wrote a fantastic and very complete article on this "event" but I'm still unable to locate again, but I do have a link to a less complete explanation of it which I will post.
Others, as well, have written on the likelihood of the Tate murders being a "false flag" operation.
             </p>
             <p>
              At the time there was a growing youth movement which was anti-war and anti-MIC . . .
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Indeed, in 1972, when the details began to come out about a break-in at Democratic Party headquarters in the Watergate Hotel, Mae immediately recognized personnel and modus operandi from nine years of assassination research, while the mainstream press continued to refer to Watergate as a "caper" and "a third-rate burglary." And so it came to pass that while Rabbi Magnin was entertaining Richard Nixon at his home in Los Angeles, his daughter Mae was revealing the President's role in an incredible conspiracy. Meanwhile, she also perceived an assassination plot, not merely against specific individuals, but against the entire counterculture that was burgeoning at the time.
    "I realized that in this country we had a revolution--of housing, food, hair style, clothing, cosmetics, transportation, value systems, religion--it was an economic revolution, affecting the cosmetics industry, canned foods, the use of land; people were delivering their own babies, recycling old clothes, withdrawing from spectator sports. They were breaking the barriers where white and black could rap in 1967. This was the year of the Beatles, the summer of Sergeant Pepper, the Monterey Pop Festival, Haight-Ashbury, make your own candle and turn off the electricity, turn on with your friends and laugh--that's what life was all about."

               ARMY    The Army began their chemical testing of LSD, the youth drug, in 1956, the same year they were planning Politica and Camelot in Cambridge, Mass.
    Contracts for testing LSD and chemical agents continued through 1975.
    January 21, 1969, the army reported "the LSD tests are rewarding. It is recommended that the actual application of LSD be utilized in real situations on an experimental basis."
    Acid was distributed, surreptitiously, to large masses of the population. It was the chemical that was to link Helter Skelter and Gimme Shelter with blood and gore.

               FACT  4    There is more to the creation of the Manson Family, and their direction than has yet been exposed.
    There is more to the making of the movie Gimme Shelter than has been explained.
    This saga has inter-connecting links to all the beautiful people Robert Hall was associated with.
    The Manson Family and the Hell's Angels were instruments by which enemy forces could attack and discredit hippies and critical American youth who had dropped out of the establishment.
    The violence came down from Neo-Nazi racists, adorned with Swastikas both in L.A. and in the Bay Area at Altamont.
    The blame was placed on persons not even associated with the causes of death at all.
    When it was all over, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones were the icing on this cake, this presentation, to rub musicians into a racist, neo-nazi plot.
    By rearranging the facts, cutting here and there, distorting evidence, neighbors and family feared their own youth wandering through the communities.
    Charles Manson made the cover of Life, with those wide eyes, like Rasputin.
    Charles Watson didn't make the cover. Why not? He participated in all the killings. Manson wasn't inside the house. Because Manson played a guitar and made records. Watson didn't.
    Charles Watson was too busy taking care of matters, at the lawyer's office prior to the killings, or with officials of the Young Republicans.
    What were Watson's protections in Texas, where he remained until his separate trial prevented him from being psychologically linked to all the deaths he actually committed?
    "Pigs" was written in Sharon Tate's house in blood. Was this to make blacks become targets and suspects for stalking white territory?
    Credit cards of the La Bianca family were purposely deposited in the black ghetto after their massacre. The intention was to stir racial fears and hatred.
    Who wrote the first article, "Did Hate Kill Tate?", blaming the Black Panthers for the murders? Army intelligence agent Ed Butler, Lee Harvey Oswald's old pal from New Orleans. They made a record together so that Oswald could pass himself off as a Marxist. Another deception.
    Glasses were left on the floor of Sharon Tate's home the day of the murder. They were never identified.
    Who moved all the bodies after the killers left and before the police arrived?
    The Spahn ranch wasn't a hippie commune. It bordered the Krupp ranch, and has now been combined and incorporated to make a German Bavarian beer garden. Howard Hughes knew George Spahn. He went to this ranch daily while making The Outlaw.

                <p>
                 I can see obfuscation in the claim that it is the right-wing controlling history and reality, because I believe it is just one side of the same thing.  Right hand, left hand - both parts of the same body with one mind controlling them.  Of course a mind can be schizoid so it can seem like there are two personalities with their own characteristics but in essence it is one and the same.

                <p>
                 Got to say that if our democratic political systems were people then they would have probably been committed in mental institutions a long time ago.

                 <p>
                  However, BOTH parties have been owned and controlled by the right wing for decades now.
Koch Bros. and other large corporations own the Democratic Party as well and that has been 
true since the days of the DLC (Democratic Leadership Council) and they were represented on
the DLC's Executive Board.  Bill Clinton was specifically recruited by the Koch Bros.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Koch Bros. Family is the John Birch Society and have worked for more than 100 years to try to overturn democracy in the US.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The McCarthy Era was about removing liberals from office and we haven't had a liberal
in the White House since JFK.

                 <p>
                  A small group of wealthy people have been running our country since the earliest days --
Re-read the Constitution and you will see that the document you were taught to honor and
esteem was one where the Founders actually created an Elite Patriarchy, endowed them 
with land grants and gave the immense influence and control over the "people's" government,
the nation's wealth and natural resources.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The Founders also saved and protected the system of Slavery for Elites/wealthy even down to
the "Runaway Slave Act" which guaranteed the Civil War which further profited the wealthy by
dividing the population of the nation into two camps of hatred which still echo today.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Certainly agree with you that the people controlling our government, MIC, NSA and other government
agencies are insane -- and we should point that out more frequently -- !!

                   these rightwing benefactors are the Koch brothers. But the Kochs have been working both sides of the fence. As Bill Berkowitz writes, the Koch brothers have also been funding the Democratic Leadership Council.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   According to SourceWatch, a project of the Center for Media &amp; Democracy, the brothers are "leading contributors to the Koch family foundations, which supports a network of Conservative organizations and think tanks, including Citizens for a Sound Economy, the Manhattan Institute the Heartland Institute, and the Democratic Leadership Council."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Charles Koch co-founded the Cato Institute in 1977, while David helped launch Citizens for a Sound Economy [now FreedomWorks] in 1986.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                   "Freeing Democrats from being, well, Democrats has been the Democratic Leadership Council's mission since its founding 16 years ago by Al Gore, Chuck Robb, and a handful of other conservative, mostly southern Dems as a rump faction of disaffected elected officials and party activists. Producing and directing the DLC is Al From, its founder and CEO, who's been the leader, visionary, and energizing force behind the New Democrat movement since Day One." --Robert Dreyfuss, The American Prospect, April 23, 2001.

                   Funding
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   An August, 2000 Newsweek story on Joe Liebermn, The Soul And The Steel[1] reveals that some of the early funding came from ARCO, Chevron, Merck, Du Pont, Microsoft, Philip Morris and Koch Industries:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   His selection may also complicate Gore's efforts to depict Bush as a patsy for big business. Since 1995 Lieberman has chaired the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the centrist think tank that eschews liberal dogma and promotes market-oriented approaches to policy. Like many similar groups, the DLC (of which Gore is a founding member) has never disclosed its funding sources. But last week, in response to requests from NEWSWEEK, it turned over a list of top donors. If Gore still hopes to score populist points by bashing Big Oil and pharmaceutical companies that oppose his plan to add a prescription-drug entitlement to Medicare, he may have some explaining to do. Among the DLC's biggest benefactors last year (contributions of between $50,000 and $100,000) were ARCO, Chevron and the drug giant Merck. Other big underwriters include Du Pont, Microsoft and Philip Morris (which has kicked in $500,000 since Lieberman became DLC chairman). There is no evidence that the DLC has trimmed policies to accommodate its patrons, but some contributors say the money has helped ensure an open door to Lieberman. "We've been able to have a dialogue with the senator and his staff," said Jay Rosser, spokesman for another DLC benefactor, Koch Industries, an oil-pipeline firm that is also a big GOP donor.

                    Hi Konran --
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The Koch Bros. are much more dangerous than your "recent times" accounts for.  They were at least indirectly involved in the JFK assassination* -- and which not only took our president but our "people's" government.  From that time, our government has been in the hands of murderers and essentially insane or "soulless" people.  LBJ exemplifies those involved at highest levels but he had long been involved with those like himself -- criminal, murderous and insane.  The latter by his own definition.
See:  LBJ:  Mastermind of the JFK Assassination by Phillip Nelson
See:  Blood, Money, Power by Barr McClellan
See:  The Men Who Killed Kennedy/The Guilty Men on YouTube
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F-LY1HblmE">

                   </p>
                   <p>
                    But the Koch Bros. have always been involved with control of the nation's natural resources.
The Oil Industry (Clint Murchinson, prominently) had high motivation for the JFK assassination.
JFK was concerned for the environment and was going to overturn the Oil Depletion Allowance.

                   <p>
                    You are comparing this with the "Satanic globalist child-murdering f's and their plan over centurie." . . .
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Certainly, I don't think anyone has suggested that the Koch Bros. are involved in human trafficking, but they are supporting both parties and their candidates and thus are at the least INDIRECTLY involved because of who they support.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    (And, I would interject here again that there is no "Satan" and no "Devil" and no "Hell" which are simply the creations of organized patriarchal religions of the one-all male god.  That does NOT mean that these boogey-men haven't been used to frighten the public into obedience and as a means of Mind Control  Of course they have.  Nor does it mean that there isn't real violence used in the rituals to frighten their victims.
The Old World Religions which existed thousands and thousands of years before had NO Satan, No Devil, No Hell and were based in Nature.  The demons created by male-supremacist religions come from the minds and paranoia of males and are strictly their inventions -- fear used for the purpose of Mind Control.)
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Nothing could be clearer than that our economies are created by citizens, but that they are manipulated and controlled by our Banks, Financial Institutions (and by our corrupt government and government officials) to benefit the wealthy.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    As for religion, you can't ignore the Old Testament/Hebrew which was written to cement patriarchy.
You also have to consider that both the Old Testament and the New Testament are the underpinning for Elite Patriarchy and male-supremacy.  The New Testament actually at times shows a Jesus in conflict with these changes where the history up to that time had followed matriarchal lines -- i.e., Joseph's family history was actually Mary's.  And, most of these religions are manipulated regularly, as needed, for the benefit of Elites.
"Manifest Destiny" and "Man's Dominion Over Nature" having given license for exploitation of Nature by Elites.
Not only Nature and all animal-life, but even discrimination and murder based in myths of "inferiority" of women, native Americans, Jews, Homosexuals, Africans/People of Color.
See:  Papal Edicts Calling for the "enslavement or murder" of Native Americans here and Africans enslaved here.

                    And your paragraph before last repeats what I am saying to you ... Elite Patriarchy invented organized patriarchal religion and it is Elite Patriarchy which gives us these Elite male organizations where MALE heads of religions are involved (Knights of Malta) and where Elites males are involved with CFR, Skull and Bones, and Bilderberg, and among Elite MALES heading up our military ... where if you're familiar with Kay Griggs you also know that sexual abuse/violence is used at top levels, even NATO.

                    World violence begins with male violence against women - basically thought to have begun with a famine in an area behind Turkey.  But we are the ONLY species on the planet where the male population is involved in DEADLY violence and oppression of females.  You will note that for the most part, even combat between males among other species is never to the death.  It is believed that this oppression began about 50,000 years ago and turned the world upside down.

Pedophiles are actually thought to have no sexual orientation.  However heterosexual males who prefer sexual relations with females will sexually abuse a child if a female isn't available to them.  Even right-wing women's groups agree that it is males who are our sexual abusers of children.  If you want more info on this, let me know.

                    What can we do?  ONLY non-violent activity can be considered.
There are many ways to act but the underlining motivation has to be to STOP cooperating with Elites and Capitalism.  And there are many ways to do this.

                     But if you look at the posters at tea party rallies, and the birthers, and the right wing’s code words (urban, un-American, different, elitist) it all sounds a lot like what they did to Kennedy from 1962-1963. Jews, African Americans, Hispanics, women, the poor, the LGBT community, liberals, unions, socialists, communists, pacifists, Democrats. Looks fairly similar to the laundry list the Nazis had used to fill their camps, doesn’t it? It’s a disturbing legacy of hate, bigotry and incitement, and the Koch family uses their money to make sure they can continue in this legacy. Make no mistake, the Koch family has been doing this for three generations-they’re not going anywhere."

                     The male dominion that we live in can be shown to have led to our current state where all things nefarious happen.  However, recently I feel we are losing our way with the trans-gender agenda and the female aspect of society is being watered down.  This cannot be blamed on the Koch brothers, and neither can they be blamed solely for the current political environment.  That was all I was trying to infer.

                      Thank you for the very honest response re transgenderism .....
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      But, aside from some religious beliefs I'm not familiar with, I don't see how this becomes a personal 
concern for anyone except the family involved.  Can you explain?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      As for "the female aspect of society being watered down" .... I'm also not quite sure that I fully
understand that, either.  Please fill me in.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Unfortunately, right wing beliefs do extend to what some right-wingers consider "moral" issues
which they would like to control.  For example, when the Vatican seeks to control its members
and their "sexuality" they have often been in a position to impose those values not only on their
members, but on all of society.
One example of that was birth control which was denied to citizens of the US until the late 1960's.
Another issue would be female equality and the ERA which they campaigned against (secretly, I believe)
by funding the anti-ERA movement with tax-exempt dollars.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The Koch Bros. are part of the right wing and are certainly involved in seeking control 
over all of society, including on issues which touch our personal lives.
And that includes female equality.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      There is an organization I've been aware of for like 20 years which is the Business Round
Table and they generally like to keep their 200-300 members' list confidential, but I do recall
having the list and prominent on that list was AT&amp;T and Hallmark Cards. Well, most of the 
AT&amp;T employees at that time were females and who buys most of the birthday and holiday
cards for the family but females?  I doubt that even today most citizens know how many 
corporations are working against their interests in fairly secret ways.

                       Anyway, taking your questions individually - transgenderism and the current socio-political need to legislate the idea into society is a slippery slope in my opinion.  It strikes me that we have a portion of the younger generation who are playing imagination games and they are making everyone play their game.  What used to occur with children between the ages of 4 - 10 (pre-pubescent) in imagination play was that they decided to be a doctor or cowboy or teacher or girl/boy.  It's fantasy play and an essential part of forming ourselves into better humans as well as helping to define what we are.  Now with the millenials having grown up with computer/console games prevalent during those formative years, there has been a delay in reaching that stage of imagination play.  This is where we are now in regards to some young and vocal transgender people who are pushing for legal redress to hurt feelings - this I feel is unhealthy as there seems to be an inherent need to force the world to join in with their game.  Instead of learning to deal with their hurt feelings the activist transgenders are forcing society at large to join their game due to politically correct shaming.  Take the C16 amendment in Canada that legislates the misuse of pronouns when addressing a transgender person is to be seen as a hate crime with a maximum fine of C$250,000.  This is pure fascism and goes against my idea of freedom of speech.

                      <p>
                       The female aspect of society has been watered down since ancient times, but more so in modern history.  There has been a time where the feminine aspects of our personalities were made to seem negative - emotional empathy, intuition, the mothering aspect of caring for others, etc.  In historical studies most of the sources used to teach are drawn from male commentators and philosophical writers.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Feminism in its current form does nothing but create more inequality and pushes unjustifiable claims such as Fathers Day being a patriarchal holiday that should be renamed Special Person day due to the emotional impact on children who don't have a father in their lives.  This is nonsense and moves further away from the original ideology of fighting for equality.  Now don't get me wrong, I don't believe in any kind of equality being attainable (we are all different) - however, I do believe in equal opportunities, and I will fight for them as much as anyone.  For me with all the group identity politics around at the moment we are losing sight of the prize more and more.

                       I think the Koch Bros. are culpable for many of the things you have mentioned and I'm sure they will be influencing what they can as much as they can.  And yet I cannot ignore the fact that there are plenty more nefarious actors in the world who are part and parcel of maintaining and furthering their control over society.  In fact looking at corporate capitalism and those who are most successful within this ideological system one can argue that they should actually be diagnosed as psychopaths.  Capitalism is the physical manifestation of the psychopathic need to dominate and destroy competition for a selfish goal.  Apparently there is one psychopath in every hundred and so though the Koch Bros. might be influencing things more than others (as you see it) there will be plenty more who are doing the same and even more.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Citizens need to wake up to this fact first.  Then maybe we can start changing the system so that people like the Kochs and businesses like Bayer, Monsanto, BAE, Facebook, Google or whoever cannot influence things as much as they do.

                        In order to deal with the issue of sexual abuse of children, there has to be trust in believing what the children are telling us.  Too often that's been a problem -- in a male-dominated society it was very easy for males to suggest that it was the child who was lying about sexual abuse by a father ... which is the most common situation.
                       </p>

                        If you don't trust what children say, how can you support the reality of their sexual abuse?

                        It's also confusing that you would think that transgenderism is about some kind of "game playing" ... 
Do you really think this is fun for the child or the parents, the family?

                       <p>
                        And aren't the things you're saying about transgenderism the same things that were said about homosexuals?

                        I'm very glad to see that you support "equal opportunities" .... but, you know, I'm totally unaware of the Canadian law or the issue of "Father's Day" -- so I don't really see them as real feminist issues but rather something that the right wing pulls up to distract the public.

                        Re Koch Bros. -- they are corporate capitalism -- and their family are founding members of the John Birch Society.
The family has been involved in trying to overturn democracy for more than 100 years.  Their business is also fossil fuels which have created Global Warming.  Given the disasters we are seeing right now with storms in Texas and now headed toward Florida, with earthquake in Mexico, there is a push for legislation to get "off of fossil fuels" ...
and also to make the oil industry pay for the damages we are seeing right now.
                        <br/>
                        The Oil industry -- chiefly ExxonMobil allied with other oil companies -- ran Global Warming denials for more than 50 years at a cost of $50 billion.  Our scientists have known about GW since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution ...
and the model was shown to the public back in the late 1950's.  All of this could have been prevented.

                         I do trust children when it comes to child abuse.  As long as there are no leading questions then we can normally assume that the child is telling the truth.  I do not class the sexual or physical abuse claims of children as 'game playing'.  I was actually talking about the teens and pre-adults that we see in the trans-activist videos prevalent on Youtube when I stated the 'game-playing' analysis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         It is funny you mention homosexuals because it has been proven statistically that around 80% of those 'trans-genders' who do not have hormone therapy or any surgery actually establish that they are simply homosexual when they reach young adulthood.  The confusion of these peoples' early years can be made more confusing with all these new gender categories that were created by Tumblr users and are now being championed by numerous 'liberal' governments of PC dominated societies (such as the UK, Canada and Australia).

                         I am neither right-wing nor left so I don't believe I am coming at this from any ideological standpoint - it is simply my opinion and belief based upon what I have seen in recent times.  Maybe I am wrong and most of what I have talked about is just minor distractions.  However, when an organisation like the Tavistock Institute (now called The Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust) is prescribing hormone treatments to children as young as 12 and guidance for transitioning to children as young as 4 then I seriously question the motives behind this new movement.

                          Since I'm not aware of the specific "trans-activist" videos you're watching on YouTube, there is 
no way to estimate the source of your opinion that it is "game playing."

                          A human being whose brain tells them that they are female while their genitalia is male will
NOT eventually or simply reach the conclusion that they are homosexual.
                          <br/>
                          What you're reading is confusing you ... especially if you think that "new gender categories
that were created by Tumblr users" ... whatever that is.

                            I did take the time to watch both of the videos -- and I found both very interesting

                            The Professor -- Jordan Peterson/Clinical Psychologist at University of Toronto -- is showing his personal disrespect for the students by refusing to acknowledge the transgender status of the students he is teaching at the University by not using the "pronoun" they prefer showing disrespect for the student.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Peterson has also received at least two warnings from the University Administration that he is to follow University policy on this issue which he has not been doing.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Peterson is claiming a "violation of his free speech rights" -- however, as a teacher at the University who should be offering good example to all of the students in human respect, he is doing just the opposite . . .

                            That is ... also notice that he uses the "perjorative" . . . "Social Justice Warrior"

                            The bottom line is respect for the individual student at the University in showing them the courtesy of using the "pronoun" they prefer as trans.

                             What's wrong with simple 'justice'?  Like normal, straightforward justice.  No adjective needed surely...it's like 'Political Justice', 'Criminal Justice', 'Court Justice', 'Police Justice', 'Gang Justice', or 'Ideological Justice', etc.  (&lt;---Add your own favourite noun or adjective to play the 'My Justice' game)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             The problem with modifiers and 'Justice' is that it normally means one group then has to make the rules for that particular type of justice.  How can that ever be truly balanced or just?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             So what is social justice?  Is it the ability to vote?  To work?  To own a house?  To be able to drink clean water?  To be free?  Is it Communism?  Socialism?  Liberalism?  Cultural Marxism?  Libertarianism?  Anarchism?  Feminism?  Transgenderism Pronoun Recognition? - or what, and who is it that really decides?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             I agree that certain words are hateful and normally contain a history of intolerance and subjugation, they can hurt feelings and sometimes deeply, but they are only words.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             I wonder what happened to the idea behind the rhyme that "Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never hurt me"?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             And then to the point in question in your comment - why should anyone be allowed to force anyone else to
                             <em>
                              say
                             </em>
                             anything?  That sounds like what old terrorist kidnap victims were forced to do on television when telling us their terrorists' demands.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             Whatever, I don't mind what any adult does with their life as long as it doesn't hurt them, or is with consenting adults, and I believe that means I'm allowed to expect the same back.  I think demanding other people do as you say for whatever reason (including social respect) is the kind of thing that leads to a dangerous slippery slope.  I have gay and lesbian and bisexual friends and they don't give a shit about pronouns - we use each others names, and what is more important to us is what's inside each of us and how we are with one another - and that has never included any bullshit pronoun crap.

                              Otherwise, you are denying that AA's have been denied voting rights. 
That we are all denied fair elections because of the corruption of our Electoral System.
That we have more AA's and people of color locked up in our shiny new privatized prison system than any other nation.  and that there is a continuing denial of work to AA's, and decent standards of education where we see a return to segregated schools and the underfunding of AA's schools.
And what about owning a home ... how many reports have we seen over decades which show that banks do not lend in the same way to AA's and people of color.

                              And what's the usual "reasoning" behind these things except for the teachings of male-supremacist religions?

                              Actually, I think when compared with the system of Slavery on this land, with the Genocide, with a few hundred years of Segregation ... with Segregated schools, our Prison system, with AA's being brutalized and shot on their own streets pretty much every week, I think you are ignoring a great deal of reality and involved in a bit of "game-playing" yourself in this statement ...
                             </p>

                               Whatever, I don't mind what any adult does with their life as long as it doesn't hurt them, or is with consenting adults, and I believe that means I'm allowed to expect the same back. I think demanding other people do as you say for whatever reason (including social respect) is the kind of thing that leads to a dangerous slippery slope. I have gay and lesbian and bisexual friends and they don't give a shit about pronouns - we use each others names, and what is more important to us is what's inside each of us and how we are with one another - and that has never included any bullshit pronoun crap.&gt;

                              And what was the lady at the marriage license bureau doing except "demanding that other people do as she said" ... because her "god" demanded it.   When might you expect to be effected by something like that?  Probably never.

                              And nice that you have gay and lesbian and bisexual friends ... but hard to believe that NONE of them have ever been bothered in any way by the social mores that have long existed against them.

                              The public has spoken on human rights for homosexuals a long time before the Supreme Court did ... that's why they finally moved to pass same-sex marriage.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              Agree that what is important is what is inside each of us and "how we are with one another."

                              And I presume by that you mean HOW we treat one another.
Isn't that the truest test of who a person is?
