<blockquote>
<p>Introduction by Michael A. Aquino Lt. Colonel, Military Intelligence, USAR-Ret November 2003 </p>
<p>In the later 1970s, Psychological Operations (PSYOP) doctrine in the U.S. Army had </p>
<p>yet to emerge from the disappointment and frustration of the Vietnam War. Thus it was that in 1980 Colonel Paul Vallely 1 , Commander of the 7th PSYOP Group, asked me, as his Headquarters PSYOP Research &amp; Analysis (FA) Team Leader, to draft a paper that would encourage some futurethought within the PSYOP community. I prepared an initial draft, which Colonel Vallely reviewed and annotated, which resulted in revised drafts and critiques until he was satisfied, and the result of that was this Colonel Vallely sent copies of it to various governmental offices, agencies, commands, and publications involved or interested in PSYOP. He intended it not as an article for publication, but simply as a &quot;talking paper&quot; to stimulate dialogue. In this it was quite successful, judging by the extensive and lively letters he received concerning it over the next several months. That should have been the end of MindWar: a minor &quot;staff study&quot; which had done its modest job. </p>
<p>With the arising of the Internet in the 1980s, however, MindWar received an entirely </p>
<p>unexpected - and somewhat comic - resurrection. ...</p>
<p>Within the U.S. military, PSYOP has habitually been relegated to a back-seat as a </p>
<p>&quot;force multiplier&quot;. The principal strategic decisions are made in consideration of traditional </p>
<p>political and military interests and goals. Only then is PSYOP invited to the table, to help </p>
<p>achieve already-agreed-upon missions more efficiently. </p>
<p>MindWar reverses this sequence. Psychological means for achieving victory - </p>
<p>essentially through convincing the enemy that he really wants to bring his national policies </p>
<p>into harmony with ours - are fashioned in support of basic political goals. The use of </p>
<p>&quot;ordinary&quot; military force (bombs, bullets, etc.) is regarded as a &quot;last resort&quot; in </p>
<p>circumstances wherein MindWar by itself fails.</p>
<hr />
<p>-Page 3 Mindwar 1980 - </p>
<p>The advantage of Mind War is that it conducts wars in nonlethal, noninjurious, and </p>
<p>nondestructive ways. Essentially you overwhelm your enemy with argument. You seize </p>
<p>control of all of the means by which his government and populace process information to </p>
<p>make up their minds, and you adjust it so that those minds are made up as you desire. </p>
<p>Everyone is happy, no one gets hurt or killed, and nothing is destroyed.  
</p>
<hr />
<p>Page 4 MindWar (1980)</p>
<p>Psychotronic research is in its infancy, but the U.S. Army already possesses an </p>
<p>operational weapons systems designed to do what LTC Alexander would like ESP to do - </p>
<p>except that this weapons system uses existing communications media. It seeks to map the </p>
<p>minds of neutral and enemy individuals and then to change them in accordance with U.S. </p>
<p>national interests. It does this on a wide scale, embracing military units, regions, nations, </p>
<p>and blocs. In its present form it is called Psychological Operations (PSYOP). </p>
<hr />
<p>Page 5 MindWar (1980)</p>
<p>MindWar is the deliberate, aggressive convincing of </p>
<p>all participants in a war that we will win that war. </p>
<p>It is deliberate in that it is planned, systematic, and comprehensive effort involving all </p>
<p>levels of activity from the strategic to the tactical. It is aggressive because opinions and </p>
<p>attitudes must be actively changed from those antagonistic to us to those supportive of us </p>
<p>if we are to achieve victory. We will not win if we content ourselves with countering </p>
<p>opinions and attitudes instilled by enemy governments. We must reach the people before </p>
<p>they resolve to support their armies, and we must reach those armies before our combat </p>
<p>troops ever see them on battlefields. </p>
<hr />
<p>Page 7 MindWar (1980)</p>
<p>To this end MindWar must be strategic in emphasis, with tactical applications playing </p>
<p>a reinforcing, supplementary role. In its strategic context, MindWar must reach out to </p>
<p>friends, enemies, and neutrals alike across the globe - neither through primitive </p>
<p>&quot;battlefield&quot; leaflets and loudspeakers of PSYOP nor through the weak, imprecise, and </p>
<p>narrow effort of psychotronics 11 - but through the media possessed by the United States </p>
<p>which have the capabilities to reach virtually all people on the face of the Earth. </p>
<p>These media are, of course, the electronic media - television and radio. State of the </p>
<p>art developments in satellite communication, video recording techniques, and laser and </p>
<p>optical transmission of broadcasts make possible a penetration of the minds of the world </p>
<p>such as would have been inconceivable just a few years ago. Like the sword Excalibur, we </p>
<p>have but to reach out and seize this tool; and it can transform the world for us if we have </p>
<p>the courage and the integrity to enhance civilization with it. If we do not accept Excalibur, </p>
<p>then we relinquish our ability to inspire foreign cultures with our morality. If they then </p>
<p>desire moralities unsatisfactory to us, we have no choice but to fight them on a more </p>
<p>brutish level. </p>
<p>MindWar must target all participants if it is to be effective. It must not only weaken </p>
<p>the enemy; it must strengthen the United States. It strengthens the United States by </p>
<p>denying enemy propaganda access to our people, and by explaining and emphasizing to </p>
<p>our people the rationale for our national interest in a specific war. </p>
<p>Quite right, and so it must be axiomatic of MindWar that it always speaks the truth. </p>
<p>Its power lies in its ability to focus recipients\' attention on the truth of the future as well </p>
<p>as that of the present. MindWar thus involves the stated promise of the truth that the </p>
<p>United States has resolved to make real if it is not already so. </p>
<hr />
<p>Page 8 </p>
<p>A MindWar message does not have to fit conditions of abstract credibility as do </p>
<p>PSYOP themes; its source makes it credible.</p>
<hr />
<p>Page 9 / 10</p>
<p>this is nothing that can be easily faked, if in fact it can be faked at all. &quot;Rapport&quot;, </p>
<p>which the Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychological and Psychoanalytical Terms </p>
<p>defines as &quot;unconstrained relations of mutual confidence&quot;, approaches the subliminal; </p>
<p>some researchers have suggested that it is itself a subconscious and even perhaps even </p>
<p>ESP-based &quot;accent&quot; to an overt exchange of information. </p>
<p>Why does one believe one television newsman more than another, even though both </p>
<p>may report the same headlines? The answer is that there is rapport in the former case; </p>
<p>and it is a rapport which has been recognized and cultivated by the most successful </p>
<p>broadcasters. </p>
<p>For the mind to believe in its own decisions, it must feel that it made those decisions </p>
<p>without coercion. Coercive measures used by the operative, consequently, must not be </p>
<p>detectable by ordinary means. There is no need to resort to mind-weakening drugs such as </p>
<p>those explored by the CIA; in fact the exposure of a single such method would do </p>
<p>unacceptable damage to MindWar\' s reputation for truth. </p>
<p>Existing PSYOP identifies purely-sociological factors which suggest appropriate </p>
<p>idioms for messages. Doctrine in this area is highly developed, and the task is basically one </p>
<p>of assembling and maintaining individuals and teams with enough expertise and experience </p>
<p>to apply the doctrine effectively. This, however, is only the sociological dimension of target </p>
<p>receptiveness measures. There are some purely natural conditions under which minds may </p>
<p>become more or less receptive to ideas, and MindWar should take full advantage of such phenomena as atmospheric electromagnetic activity , air ionization, and extremely low frequency waves . <em>5G?</em></p>

            To this end MindWar must be strategic in emphasis, with tactical applications playing
           </p>
           <p>
            a reinforcing, supplementary role. In its strategic context, MindWar must reach out to
           </p>
           <p>
            friends, enemies, and neutrals alike across the globe - neither through primitive
           </p>
           <p>
            "battlefield" leaflets and loudspeakers of PSYOP nor through the weak, imprecise, and
           </p>
           <p>
            narrow effort of psychotronics 11 - but through the media possessed by the United States
           </p>
           <p>
            which have the capabilities to reach virtually all people on the face of the Earth.
           </p>
           <p>
            These media are, of course, the electronic media - television and radio. State of the

           <p>
            optical transmission of broadcasts make possible a penetration of the minds of the world
           </p>
           <p>
            such as would have been inconceivable just a few years ago. Like the sword Excalibur, we
           </p>
           <p>
            have but to reach out and seize this tool; and it can transform the world for us if we have
           </p>
           <p>
            the courage and the integrity to enhance civilization with it. If we do not accept Excalibur,
           </p>
           <p>
            then we relinquish our ability to inspire foreign cultures with our morality. If they then
           </p>
           <p>
            desire moralities unsatisfactory to us, we have no choice but to fight them on a more
           </p>
           <p>
            brutish level.
           </p>
           <p>
            MindWar must target all participants if it is to be effective. It must not only weaken
           </p>
           <p>
            the enemy; it must strengthen the United States. It strengthens the United States by
           </p>
           <p>
            denying enemy propaganda access to our people, and by explaining and emphasizing to
           </p>
           <p>
            our people the rationale for our national interest in a specific war.
           </p>
           <p>
            Quite right, and so it must be axiomatic of MindWar that it always speaks the truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its power lies in its ability to focus recipients' attention on the truth of the future as well
           </p>
           <p>
            as that of the present. MindWar thus involves the stated promise of the truth that the
           </p>
           <p>
            United States has resolved to make real if it is not already so.

           </p>
           <p>
            may report the same headlines? The answer is that there is rapport in the former case;
           </p>
           <p>
            and it is a rapport which has been recognized and cultivated by the most successful

            For the mind to believe in its own decisions, it must feel that it made those decisions
           </p>
           <p>
            without coercion. Coercive measures used by the operative, consequently, must not be
           </p>
           <p>
            detectable by ordinary means. There is no need to resort to mind-weakening drugs such as
           </p>
           <p>
            those explored by the CIA; in fact the exposure of a single such method would do
           </p>
           <p>
            unacceptable damage to MindWar' s reputation for truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Existing PSYOP identifies purely-sociological factors which suggest appropriate
           </p>
           <p>
            idioms for messages. Doctrine in this area is highly developed, and the task is basically one
           </p>
           <p>
            of assembling and maintaining individuals and teams with enough expertise and experience
           </p>
           <p>
            to apply the doctrine effectively. This, however, is only the sociological dimension of target
           </p>
           <p>
            receptiveness measures. There are some purely natural conditions under which minds may
           </p>
           <p>
            become more or less receptive to ideas, and MindWar should take full advantage of such phenomena as atmospheric electromagnetic activity , air ionization, and extremely low frequency waves .

             After 9/11, the late Roger Ailes, then the chairman and CEO of Fox News, assembled a roster of camera-ready retired military officers. Ailes wanted Fox to ooze muscular gravitas as the Pentagon went after the Taliban in Afghanistan and then Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Retired Army Maj. General Paul Vallely told me he was directed by Ailes to put together the team of military analysts and got a Fox contract for Cowan, who had already appeared on “60 Minutes” and “PBS Frontline.” Cowan distinguished himself at Fox as “a highly regarded go-to guy,” says retired Navy Captain Chuck Nash, another member of the Fox military analyst team at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
             During this period, many of the military analysts seen on Fox and other networks, including Vallely and Cowan, were granted private Pentagon briefings and access to classified information in the run-up to the Iraq invasion and during the war. It was part of a coordinated Pentagon information campaign to “generate favorable news coverage of the [Bush] administration’s wartime performance,” the New York Times revealed in a blockbuster 2008 story.

             IMO Trump Derangement Syndrome is the "disintoxication" of which Colonel Aquino and Colonel Paul E. Valley spoke in the influntial paperentitled "From PSYOP to MindWar:The Psychology of Victory".
            </p>
            <p>
             Michael Aquino worked at the NSA senior levels. It is difficult to find his NSA career online, as it seems to have been scrubbed from the webs. He was certainly a colorful figure. He founded the Temple of Set, a derivative of the works of Aleister Crowley. BTW I am one of few anons who do not concur with the judgement against Crowley we have taken. He is misinterpreted, not only by the public but by many of the evil organizations which attempted to follow his lead. Crowley has been my path of return to Jesus and God, ironically.
            </p>
            <p>
             Think of the occult connections we are finding with former high ranking military and government officials. We say Satanism, but it is not. It is Luciferianism. Big difference. IMO MindWar is what they were doing to result in Trump Derangement Syndrome.
            </p>

            <p>
             Aquino and Valley say:
            </p>
            <p>
             "…the Achilles’ heel of MindWar. Invoking as it does the most intense emotions and commitments of its audiences, it must deliver the goods as they are judged by the target audiences. If the ethical values of those audiences are not respected - if MindWar is used only in the service of ulterior motives and objectives - the resulting “disintoxication”can be socially shattering."
            </p>
            <p>
             This 10 page paper is worth reading because Aquino's MindWar is obviously how anons are fighting. Wizards and Warlocks.

             More quotes from the paper:
            </p>
            <p>
             "MindWar is the deliberate, aggressive convincing of all participants in a war that we will win that war.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is deliberate in that it is planned, systematic, and comprehensive effort involving all levels of activity from the strategic to the tactical. It is aggressive because opinions and attitudes must be actively changed from those antagonistic to us to those supportive of us if we are to achieve victory. We will not win if we content ourselves with countering opinions and attitudes instilled by enemy governments. We must reach the people beforethey resolve to support their armies, and we must reach those armies before our combat troops ever see them on battlefields."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Under existing United States law [1980], PSYOP units may not target American citizens. That prohibition is based upon the presumption that “propaganda” is necessarily a lie or at least a misleading half-truth, and that the government has no right to lie to the people. The Propaganda Ministry of Goebbels must not be a part of the American way of life.
            </p>
            <p>
             Quite right, and so it must be axiomatic of MindWar that it always speaks the truth. Its power lies in its ability to focus recipients’ attention on the truth of the future as well as that of the present. MindWar thus involves the stated promise of the truth that the United States has resolved to make real if it is not already so."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Unlike Ellul’s cynical propagandist, the MindWar operative must know that he speaks the truth, and he must be personally committed to it. What he says is only a part of MindWar; the rest - and the test of its effectiveness - lies in the conviction he projects to his audience, in the rapport he establishes with it."

                 not personally, no. I'm praying for you though.

                 I too have been banned numerous times from various subverses. But that doesn't scare/stop me from sharing info.

                <p>
                 I personally believe this pogo/zyphyr stuff is meant to keep us from looking into stuff and posting. As is all "big government is watching you" memes. Ed Snowden is another example. Maybe they do have the capacity, maybe they don't.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But they don't control you or your mind. Or what you do online/offline.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I would be very careful with all "private" messages. If they are "coming for us" It behooves us to awaken as many others as we can to continue spreading the Truth.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you want more of my opinion, you'd have to explain why you're freaking out. But if it's too personal/you're afraid it would dox you, I understand.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Personally, I'm more afraid of individuals/groups that public shame/dox/make people lose their jobs...individual assholes are a bigger threat than skynet coming for us

             . I agree this is not sci-fi nor outside the realm of even some "ancient technology", though the media psyop aspect has grown in complexity with the development of the internet and smart devices. I am glad you focussed on this almost-afterthought regarding human brainstates being affected via EMF, natural or directed. It jumped off the page for me too.

            Well Aquinos game is to ACT....
           </p>
           <p>
            Mind game will and will always be about opposing forces in time. The greatest is of course man vs woman +/-. Layer it down to colours of skin/flags/education/wealth/age/religion and so on, dont make it any fancier.
           </p>
           <p>
            The trick for a magician is to (stay) in the middle...as the conductor~electricity. To take all this opposing forces and build what YOU want to happen in time. This is the reality......
           </p>
           <p>
            In every way a (man) will act in this way the outcome will be the same one part will give in time and one part will take. It is truly a zero sum game......in time of cosmos.
           </p>

            Reposted from /Whatever . Though this is directly from the pizza monster himself, if this is too off-toping, I will delete.
