            Freemasons DO NOT rule the world!  Freemasonry is merely a TOOL that they use -- like Bilderbergers, CFR, etc.  Freemasonry is a crypto J organization (which was never mentioned in any of that info).
           </p>
           <p>
            CERTAIN BLOODLINES RULE THE WORLD, AND THEY ARE ALL J OR CRYPTO J.  Why do you think the LION (symbol of the Tribe of Judah, the main J tribe [there are four in total, one of which is crypto]) is used in the royal crests?  This info is in the BIBLE, but of course nobody reads that anymore!  The ARYANS (crypto Js, Tribe of Dan, the cousins to the Js) fit into this, too.
           </p>
           <p>
            The EAGLE is the symbol of the Tribe of Dan.  So is the SERPENT.  Ring any bells?

             On Ancient Egypt (I'm using Google Translator)(Revelation is in Spanish):
            </p>
            <p>
             ...The Osiris dynasty knew the earthly paradise of Adam and Eve; And envy took hold of them here is a revelation that will cause astonishment and immortality to its revealer; The serpent that tempted Eve, was the same pharaonic serpent; For in that far-off time all creatures were telepathic; Adam and Eve were accustomed to conversing by telepathy, with all the creatures of the universe; Here is another revelation that will astonish this world; This dwelling was destined to be telepathic by inheritance; And because of the serpent that tempted Eve, it was not; Because from the beginning, temptation was not considered in the laws of the Creator; From the very moment in which the law of the Father was violated, infinite laws had to be changed, from whose application you went; Because in the creation of the Father no one is unique; The violation that occurs in the laws of a microbe, reverberates when it is colossal; Because everything is expansive; And never stops; If your Father Jehovah had not intervened when the cursed serpent tempted your first earthly fathers, this world would be hell-world; You would not have known progress because you would all be slaves in perpetuity; It was the serpent's intention; Which was commanded and taught by the first enslavers of this planet; I say to you, that other followers of Osiris, are in this world; Are the same that they have created for centuries, rich and poor; Just as the cursed Pharaonic serpent wanted to divide the love that Adam and Eve had for their Creator, so also those who have given you a life-system based on gold divided you into rich and poor; They forgot these ambitious that you are all equal in rights before God....
            </p>
            <p>
             ...There were creatures unknown to you; Among these demons were the accursed Pharaohs; Who, like your present materialism, subjugated the ancient world; Many demons have had the world; More, none overcame these cursed; They had another science; Still higher than the Earth currently has; They commanded nature itself; They had another science; His knowledge came from distant galaxies; Its origin was before the earth was born; These damned creatures rebelled against Jehovah the Father; They did not want love to be born on Earth; They created the first slavery on Earth; And fell in disgrace before the Father Jehovah...
            </p>
            <p>
             ...The Osiris dynasty at first respected the divine laws of love of Father Jehovah; More, when satan divided other solar hierarchies in the Kingdom of Heaven, the pharaohs also divided; These galactic creatures were telepathic; They knew it by telepathy; They communicated with the distant suns; They learned laws and sciences from other worlds; The error they committed with human evolution was to have created the occult; Because neither they nor their followers enter the Kingdom of Heaven; No one asked the Father in the Kingdom of Heaven to hide anything from anyone; Behold, even the greatest wisdom that has passed through this world, fell before the divine commands of Father Jehovah; The first dynasty fell in pride before the Creator of the universe; They recognized the bear as god; And represented him as the creator of gold; Then the true spirituality degenerated; The only one; The departure of the living God; The Creator of all things; Including those they called gods; Here is the greatest abuse of power in this world; Because the pharaohs had powers in the same nature; After the first-born Son, they came; By its condition to have another evolution coming from distant galaxies; These creatures knew of the Trinity, more than any other creature of human knowledge; The Trinity represented her in her garments; The Alpha lines; Were black and yellow; Created the first philosophy of force in this world...
            </p>
            <p>
             ...From the arrival of the Pharaonic demons; These were cursed, those who transmitted to the people of Israel, the ambition to gold; The tragedy of this world, began by the eyes; Then he went into mental calculation; Greed and cunning fulfilled ambition; At first gold was regarded as art; Greed hastened possession; From the pharaonic era, the interested parties, the merchants, the lenders, the usurers, the financiers, the bankers, the hoarders; The whole range of known thieves arose; Those who have never allowed the unity of the beings of this world; Here is the legion of satan...
            </p>
            <p>
             ...
Israel was and still is the oldest seed within the human bed; Is the eldest son in it; Is the oldest nation on the planet; Is the one that has lived the most; From the human and galactic point of view; This is the cause of his remarkable intelligence; For there is no earthly invention, in which these children do not appear; But to the misery of their own sages, Israel will be numbered among the last of the nations;...
            </p>
            <p>
             ...People who never understood Father Jehova; A people who, knowing that in very remote times, was chosen by the Father; Does not hesitate to use force and exploitation as a means of life.
What did the people of Israel do? He forgot the divine command; Became a trafficker; A philosophy that exploits the most humble; What example of divine morality can you offer the world? If you were excited about this material? If it does not see beyond the influence of transient possession? Surely Israel is a blind guide to the blind; It is of no use to be an ancient nation if it violates the divine law of Father Jehovah; Israel Israel! When will you realize that the Creator of life does not like the use of force? Who kills the sword, dies by the sword; Who uses force, falls by force; Do not do to another, which you would not want them to do to you; For all creation is living; Your dead await you in the Kingdom of Heaven. Israel will disappear as a nation....

            This is an excellent base for Pizza-Gate.  A truly excellent post.  For further studies, I recommend reading up on Akhenaten and his monotheism called Aten,  then read up about the Pharoahs that followed him and the name of the Egyptian God they included in their names after the Egyptian Gods were installed:  Sobek.
