<p>Stating that the Communist infiltration was so extensive that in the future &quot;you will not recognize the Catholic Church,” Dodd testified before the U.S. House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). She said, &quot;In the 1930s, we put eleven hundred men into the priesthood in order to destroy the Church from within. The idea was for these men to be ordained, and then climb the ladder of influence and authority as Monsignors and Bishops.” </p>
<p>“when she was an active party member, she had dealt with no fewer than four cardinals within the Vatican who were working for us, [i.e. the Communist Party].”</p>
<p>In her public affidavit Dodd stated, among other things, “In the late 1920s and 1930s, directives were sent from Moscow to all Communist Party organizations. In order to destroy the [Roman] Catholic Church from within, party members were to be planted in seminaries and within diocesan organizations... I, myself, put some 1,200 men in [Roman] Catholic seminaries.”</p>
<p>&quot; Obviously “the agents” have made it their mission to admit more men devoid of morals and Christian faith into the seminaries for decades. Keep in mind that many cases of abuse took place already back in the 1960s. It seems that the abuse never was (and remains) a mere matter of priests giving in to temptation, but a comprehensive and pervasive attack on Christian morality and faith by a cunning and profoundly evil enemy.&quot;</p>

<p>ROME, September 18, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – A deal between the Vatican and Beijing reportedly to be signed by the end of the month signals Rome’s abandonment of China’s Catholics just as the communist regime is brutally cracking down on religious freedom, warn critics.
Under the terms of the “landmark” agreement, Beijing will recognize the Pope as the head of the Catholic Church in China, and the Holy See will give Beijing control over appointing bishops, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Friday.

<p>HONG KONG, November 7, 2016 (LifeSiteNews) – The highest ranking Chinese prelate in the Catholic Church says it would be &quot;absolutely unacceptable&quot; for the Vatican to strike a deal with the state-run Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association and would make the Church “totally subservient to an atheist government.&quot; Cardinal Joseph Zen told the Wall Street Journal that such an agreement would risk alienating authentic Catholics in China--the underground Church--from the Vatican.

            The Romans have been raping children for millennia. What do you think happens when a pederastic society takes over a religion? Catholicism is just Roman polytheism mixed with Christianity. Took out most of the gods, put Mary up there and some saints, Boom.

            You guys consistently deny us credibility by parroting your galaxy brain religion bullshit. Nobody fucking cares, get in the real world, god isnt real and never was. They're FUCKING OUR KIDS, including those in the catholic church. EVERY CHURCH is likely complicit because they are INSTITUTIONS that are TRUSTED WITH CHILDREN! Fuck you for bringing reds-under-the-bed mccarthyism into it.

             The Catholic church being full of pedophiles does not negate the existence of a Heavenly Father. The Catholic church is not a representation of Christianity, it is a representation of Roman and Pagan Black Cube Worship - Christian Flavored.

            Doesn't sound like there is any evidence that the 1,100 infiltrators had higher rates of being pedos than the other priests . I'm sure some of them were pedos , but there's no evidence of a correlation.

             I don't think the infiltrators were pedos , they were the presumed atheist architects of the Church's downfall who wanted to create confusion and disillusionment by creating pedophile havens in the Church. Since that is exactly what has occurred many people link the two facts together.

            I saw the court transcript about this a couple of months ago. It really is shocking. I have only read portions of it. I saved it for another day to read. I didn't see the original document posted, so here it is.

             "The Communist conspiracy provides for the infiltration of every 
phase and field of American life. Communist objectives are to create 
strife between labor and management and within the labor group it- 
self, to cause people to be suspicious and distrustful of the Govern- 
ment and the law enforcement agencies thereof, to make them dis- 
satisfied with the American way of life, particularly its economic sys- 
tem, to create doubts concerning their religious teachings, to set class 
against class, minorities against majorities, and even minorities 
against minorities when it suits their purpose. "

out of the college curricula.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is a method of despiritualizing the American people. "

            Thank you for posting this. This is one of their objectives--to annihilate Christianity.  And they are doing a good job. They have infiltrated and implanted the worms to eat the fruit from within. I really believe that Christianity  will be vilified and Christians will be persecuted in the future.  They want us in a secular, godless society.

             Agreed. We as Christians in the last 100 years have had it easy, not having to physically defend our beliefs. We've gone asleep at our posts and the gates have been breeched.The upside is that we have to think about what we've taken for granted and revalue it's place in our lives, not just give it lip service.

            The Church is following its own agenda. It was always Satanic, and the satanists are using pedo priest (who molest children and is part of the satanic credo -- just look up Aquino) to help destroy America by pretending to be shocked. It's supposed to demoralize spiritual people, and it also serves to allow them to mock Jesus Christ, the cornerstorne of Christianity.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was going to post on this. I've been following one guy that I was onto since I stumbled across his accounts on social media. I've watched him evolve into a pretty potent force. At first, he denied being a satanit, but now? He just came out of the closet and announced it. Now he's really going whole hog on: (1) the police being racist; (2) the church being full of pedos; (3) giving props to satanists because they're defending "religion" by making sure nothing discriminates against anyone's religion. Now this last point is dicey because it was used against Kavanaugh in his opinion on whether ten religious organizations could claim exemption from Kenyancare.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the interesting thing is that he's aligning himself with anti-pedos when ... when we all know better. It is inline with what the pedo elite do. They profess protecting children, but ... satanists do NOT protect children.
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem with posting about it is I won't be able to use links to any of his posts, but let me tell you he has a wild HUGE following. Imagine this being carried out all over social media and you have some idea why the cabal is being so successful in reaching susceptible people.
           </p>

            This really is a deep swamp.

               WOW, well, things should be getting even more interesting than even lately.  lol.  If that is even possible.  I have been reading and researching.  So much new stuff out there.  Katy Perry met with the pope at some event last April with Orlando Bloom.   Chopra, and many others were there and gifts were handed out and they all had The Eye on them.  It was about meditating and also stem cells.  Mind boggling.

              The mods at Voat have killed this forum. It used to be thriving. I used to post constantly, but won't anymore. Why bother? It's so overrun with shills and disinfo specialist. And even the indie journalists that are supposed to be on our side are jokes and controlled opposite. The idiot Cernovich admitted he had Kavanaugh's accuser's name and didn't release it. Then there's his pro-legalized prostitution stance. Yes, he says it will cut down on human sex trafficking and that every study shows it. No, Mike, every study NOW shows it because those studies have been written by the cabal. If you go back a few years before the purge was on and these satanists were in power, you'll see the opposite is true. It's why The Netherlands/Amsterdam became the number one human sex trafficking capital of the world.

              I'm so demoralized, but I have faith. By the way, did you see that strange remark from Trump about the storm being the "wettest"? I immediately thought of "wet works" and sure enough there was another shooting. This is going to be a mess. Oh, the other thing I wanted to mention is that emergency broadcast to our cells. Supposedly, it was scheduled for thirty minutes after the confirmation hearing, and when the hearing date was changed, it was changed to again be thirty minutes after the session.
             </p>
             <p>
              I didn't check that out to see if it was true, I just saw a tweet on it. If it were true, that's gotta mean something. Can't wait.

               Mark 4:35-41 
A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped. Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?" He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, "Quiet! Be still!" Then the wind died down and it was completely calm. He said to his disciples, "Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?" They were terrified and asked each other, "Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!"

                imho the story has already been written; the path is set. Christians will be persecuted and even killed if they do not deny Christ. They will have to hide for fear of retribution. I am a Christian, not being Jesus died on the cross, but because I adhere to his teachings of love, compassion, kindness to your fellow man/woman.  That is part of me; something I can't change. I won't and can't renounce it.  But I don't control the big picture. And I see the next generation being debauched. Suicide and self-abuse is at an all-time high amongst young people. They are drenched in pornography, violence and images of sexualised women.  This is a form of abuse, and it will only get worse. When God comes to smite (last time with water; next time with fire), I hope the pornographers, Hollywood and the luciferians are the first to go.

               WOW.  I am so surprised at all of it.  I do agree that we have had some new strange shills on here.  Yes, the cabal is trying to change the thinking on a lot of things, especially sexual.  Netherlands is a Sexpool.  I too have faith.  I am saying the St Michael the Archangel Prayer everyday Loud and Proud.  The devil is at work and real.  I wonder if wettest might have meant  that it was too wet.  You know how we researched the Fake Storms and Tornadoes and Fires.  DEW  Directed Energy Weapon and Micro wave Fires.  This was another EPIC storm.  But you could be right.  There was a shooting and the details are really making me wonder.  Wi. under Walker.  Easy to control.  Also the golfer girl killed in Iowa, again another one. Also the 3DEA guys that crashed in Sugarland Tx.  Also the release of Wanda Barzee release.  Many things to look into.  I don't know about the emergency broadcast.  Please explain.

                 Trump to Test Emergency Alert System That Contacts Every Cell Phone
                </p>
                <p>
                 In a little more than two weeks, everyone in the United States who owns a cellphone will receive a text message directly from the president.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It’s part of an effort by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to better warn people in the case of an emergency. But the program raises key concerns about the right to privacy and how the system could potentially be abused.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You’ve seen Amber Alerts and flash-flood alerts. This is the next step in cellphone emergency alerts, and it will mark the first time the president of the United States will be able to reach every cellphone user in America with a direct message that will simply say:
                </p>
                <p>
                 “This is a test of the national wireless emergency alert system. No action is needed.”

               <p>
                I was a doubter about Q, but this ... he really is sending a test alert to everyone.
               </p>
               <p>
                As for the wetworks, yeah, there've been a lot of shootings and I think he means there's going to be an uptick. I hope not, but if that's what wet means, well, it would have to be an uptick in incidents.

I am always interested in new things and want to see how this turns out, but Oh My.    Just think if BO did this and all Republicans got the message too of course.  Katie Barr the Door!  This should be very interesting.

             WOW and Holy Moly.  The swamp is getting deeper with more evil creatures.
            </p>
            <p>
             St. Michael the Archangel Prayer to ward off satan.  It works.  Written by Pope LeoXIII who was facing a similar time.

             No matter what your faith, we all want to get rid of the devil/satan.  He is lurking and wants us to think he does not exist.  That is the biggest lie ever told.    Say the Prayer and when you read it you will see how Powerful it is.

               Hmm.  Well the best thing I guess would be to counter attack with a bunch of really experienced tech savvy people that are on our side.  Not to be just like them but post facts with sources and not answer them violently.  That is evidently what he /they want to spread.   Yeah, sickens me too and I have not even read it.

                What would sicken you are the memes featuring Christ as a sick perv. Only satanists mock Christ. No one else would need to because they don't necessarily believe in Him so why would they? It's like the Muslim faith. I never mock it. If someone wants to believe in it, I'm all for it. Never occurs to me to mock it, but satanists? Oh, hell, yeah!

                 I would be sickened, yes.  When they attack Jesus Christ like that, using evil words, it only emboldens me all the more.  The devil is at work.  That is my belief.  I too think that as long as a person is doing good things I don't care what Religion they follow.  I don't think Christ cares either.  He forgave the thief on the Cross, why would he care as long as people are following his teachings, no matter their Religion.  May they Burn in Hell and may St. Michael the Archangel conquer him again standing with his foot on his head.

                  Yes, well, I guess the church being exposed is all part of the plan. This way people will learn they have been worshipping The Devil and that there is no Christ coming to save them. Then there are all these satanic cells around. These people are diabolical. And lying is part of their credo. It's what they do best. I'm watching it unfold. I sure hope the Midterms give MAGA the majority. We're going to need every strong player on our team to pull cleaning the swamp out. And having judges in positions of power is crucial to the game. The swamp creatures know this and that's why they're fighting so hard and Schumer is blocking all those confirmations.

                   There are people on both sides of the aisle blocking and lying in our govt, yes that's what is so hard to overcome this evil morass.  They have the devil on their side and their goal in mind.  But we have Jesus on our side and a peaceful future for all in mind as well.  And we have a bigger army if we can only Wake Them Up!  Yeah Schumer is a member of so many societies I have lost count.

                    Yes, but who they are is emerging through these processes. The godless socialists are also in on this and it's why Project VERITAS went to so much trouble to expose this scum.

                     Stupid sheep not believing in God.  All of a sudden they listened to some idiot espousing All Religion is bad and they not only stop going to church but stop believing all together.  I thought I was a socialist many years ago, and discovered I was not.  Too many things missing.  Never gave up my belief in God being real.  Never.  No matter who I voted for or party.  Now my belief in God has gotten even stronger and I have no belief in any party.  They have tried to poison my God and I am retaliating.

                      You should support the party that's working for you. Otherwise, you're not giving any support to the few trying to help us get back on track. How are you going to take on the satanic assault on our laws? Who do you think keeps filing suit to rid our institutions of God? But do what you want. Me? I'm at least giving the man, men, and women fighting the good fight and undergoing such venomous propaganda and blackmail support at the polls. If everyone adopts your attitude, the pedo elite will be back in conrol and we'll have every one and their mother flooding across open borders, sleeping in the streets, and openly using drugs because they'll be legal. Oh, and the sex trafficking will be, too.

                       Wow.  I said I thought I was a socialist but was wrong.  I guess I was not really aware what all that meant.  That was decades ago also peppered with voting Republican.   I do support at the polls and have not missed a Pres. election since I was 18, again many decades ago.  Party means nothing anymore to me.  I vote for the policies and research the person up the ying yang now.    I have every intention on voting in all upcoming elections.  Have not missed midterms for years either.  Maybe only a couple of times.  I am a huge supporter of voting and am very involved.  Can't give more or will dox myself.  I have no intention on supporting anyone connected to pedo elites.

                        Oh, awesome! Right now, I'm voting all Republican. It gives our POTUS the majority he's looking for, and also makes the pedos/pedo enablers stick out like sore thumbs. It's a safer way of culling the herd n terms of great candidates and patriots.

            Bishop emeritus of Hong Kong Cdl. Joseph Zen is accusing the Vatican of "selling out" the Church in China.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The Communists want to enslave the Church," he warns. "You're putting wolves before your flock, and they're going to make a massacre."
           </p>
           <p>
            Cardinal Zen is warning that ceding power to the Communist government will only increase persecution of faithful Catholics in China — the equivalent of "rewarding traitors" and "castigating the faithful." Officials in Rome, he says, are in effect telling China's faithful Catholics, "You are stupid for being loyal for so many years. Now, surrender."
           </p>
           <p>
            Zen is not alone in his criticism. Population Research Institute Steven Mosher tells Church Militant, "The officially atheistic Chinese Communist Party ... wants to stamp out all religious belief and all religious behavior in China."
           </p>
           <p>
            He warns Beijing's ultimate goals is "the imposition of atheism on everyone in China."
           </p>
           <p>
            The Chinese government is responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of its own people and remains an enemy of the Church. Faithful Catholics are mystified as to why the Vatican is courting China's Communists.
           </p>
           <p>
            This plays right into jorge's plan as well.  Killing the RCC and hopefully eventually All Religion.  Who would benefit?  Beelzebub.
           </p>
           <p>
            Beelzebub or Beelzebul (/biːˈɛlzɪbʌb/ bee-EL-zib-ub or /ˈbiːlzɪbʌb/ BEEL-zib-ub; Hebrew: בַּעַל זְבוּב‬, Baʿal Zəvûv) is a name derived from a Philistine god, formerly worshipped in Ekron, and later adopted by some Abrahamic religions as a given name to a major demon. The name Beelzebub is associated with the Canaanite god Baal.

            Zen said the Vatican may "surrender" to the Chinese government in agreeing to the deal, which would potentially allow the Chinese communist leaders to select Catholic bishops.
           </p>
           <p>
            WHAT?  Chinese COMMUNISTS Selecting Catholic Bishops!!!  WTH to do about this?  This should be Going Viral!   This Is Frightening!

             When media uses the word "Communists" I think we have to define it further: who financed Communism, who encouraged Communism to spread in Europe, who hates the Christian religion enough to cause division and destruction? The Catholic Church had a sworn enemy for 2000 years and then was made to embrace that enemy and now bow down to that enemy

             From the father of David Lau, Israel Meir Lau, Chief Rabbi of 1993-2003 comes the statement: "Crucifixes are an insult to Jews. The cross is against the Jewish religion and the sight of the cross is forbidden for a Jew."http://eponymousflower.blogspot.com/2014/05/jerusalem-francis-hid-his-pectoral.html

             Jacob Schiff: Jew and Bolshevik pocketbook
            </p>
            <p>
             "On March 23, 1917 a mass meeting was held at Carnegie Hall to celebrate the abdication of Nicolas II, which meant the overthrow of Tsarist rule in Russia. Thousands of socialists, Marxists, nihilists nand anarchists attended to cheer the event. The following day there was published on page two of the New York Times a telegram from Jacob Schiff, which had been read to this audience. He expressed regrets, that he could not attend and then described the successful Russian revolution as “…what we had hoped and striven for these long years”. (Mayor Calls Pacifists Traitors, The New York Times, March 24, 1917, p. 2)
            </p>
            <p>
             In the February 3, 1949 issue of the New York Journal American Schiff’s grandson, John, was quoted by columnist Cholly Knickerbocker as saying that his grandfather had given about $20 million for the triumph of Communism in Russia. (To appraise Schiff’s motives for supporting the Bolsheviks, we must remember, that he was a Jew and that Russian Jews had been persecuted under the Tsarist regime. Consequently the Jewish community in America was inclined to support any movement, which sought to topple the Russian government and the Bolsheviks were excellent candidates for the task. As we shall see further along, however, there were also strong financial incentives for Wall Street firms, such as Kuhn, Loeb and Company, of which Schiff was a senior partner, to see the old regime fall into the hands of revolutionaries, who would agree to grant lucrative business concessions in the future in return for financial support today.)"

              The 1910 [Red Cross] fund-raising campaign for $2 million, for example, was successful only, because it was supported by these wealthy residents of New York City. J.P. Morgan himself contributed $100,000… Henry P. Davison [a Morgan partner] was chairman of the 1910 New York Fund-Raising Committee and later became chairman of the War Council of the American Red Cross… The Red Cross was unable to cope with the demands of World War I. and in effect was taken over by these New York bankers. (Sutton: Revolution, p. 72)

              No wonder it is what it is.  The Red Cross even infiltrated at the start.  Mon Dieu.

               J.P. Morgan's daughter Anne spent money and time in France, sending ambulances and  helping postwar :
              </p>
              <p>
               "From 1917 to 1921, Morgan took residence near the French front, not far from both Soissons and the "Chemin des Dames" at Blérancourt, and ran a formidable help organisation, The American Friends of France (it employed several hundred people at a time, volunteers from abroad and locally recruited staff), financed partly out of her own deep pockets, partly with the help of an active network in the States.[6] The AFF was active in succoring noncombatants, organizing a health service that still exists in Soissons, a workshop to provide basic furniture to bombed-out families, a holiday camp for children, and a mobile library that was taken over by the library in Soissons, and so on."https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Morgan_(philanthropist)
              </p>
              <p>
               Helping has two faces: the sunny side and the reverse. One article I read had Morgan stopped by US customs because she was importing valuable antiquities without declaring their value.

                I am sure the rich was privy to much war time loot just as the nazis stole so many artifacts from many.  Not just the Jews, but others as well.  This is another benefit of war for them. Somehow they always benefit from war in many ways.

              Vampires and the devil hate Crosses too.  They recoil at the sight of one.  I think only die hard Jewish people deeply into this thinking are the problem.  There are those that do not follow this for most people don't really have the time to look into all of it.  Many Catholics go to Church with their family drop a coin in the basket and go home nowadays.  It is the rebellious haters that are spreading these horrible beliefs.  I truthfully believe there are people of this thinking, and they are possessed by the devil.  Possibly these are really satanists like the pope and not really men of their faith at all.  Either way, they should be watched.  I will now read the article.
