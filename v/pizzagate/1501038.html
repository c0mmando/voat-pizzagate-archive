The incremental nature of this operation makes it so each raising of the temperature can\'t be felt.  Eventually the frog has reached a temperature where it dies.  My thought is that with Pizzagate so hot, a lot of frogs jump out of the proverbial pot immediately.</p>
<p>As a companion strategy to the direct approach with Pizzagate, I recommend an incremental strategy based on the following logic:</p>
<ol>
<li>Child abuse, torture, killing and abduction take place in a variety of countries, and occur with participation and help from the those in power.  Suggestion:  focus on Norway, UK, and/or Saudi Arabia.  Norway is probably the most time relevant, followed by UK.  I have not see much on Saudi Arabia.</li>
<li>These people\'s crimes are covered up by those in charge.  The reason people cover up is for simple self-interest - they will be owed a favor, or they are actively using blackmail to extract money and favors.</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe these two points can be developed fairly easily, one at a time, and building on each other, and that for a large number of people, this will be easier to talk about and get them engaged then going &quot;the full monty.&quot;  I got the idea when talking with my wife who is very anti-Trump, anti-pizzagate.  Talking about UK pedophiles was easy - she had heard all sorts of stuff about British lords and MPs doing depraved things.  For mothers, worrying about sexual predators is a somewhat natural thing to do (think about the sex offender registries).  They know it\'s out there, and they know or suspect powerful people are doing it.  This may be less information driven and more intuitive/visceral.  So that\'s the inspiration for this incremental strategy.</p>
<p>The other thing it lets us do is hold the press feet to the fire in terms of hiding pedo crimes.  For example, we could talk about the recent deletion of the Norway story, which was an AP press release (see links at bottom).  We can also get an important part of pizzagate back into the ongoing conversation (i.e. child trafficking).  Right now, pizzagate is like a nuclear bomb - very unsubtle.  I\'m not saying this is &quot;bad,&quot; but it\'s simply an observation.  It\'s so toxic that it can be a conversation stopper.  In the cases it\'s not, that\'s great, it inspires people and is direct.  But in the cases it is a conversation stopper, we need other tools.</p>
<p>We can defend against &quot;fake news&quot; charges since this stuff is all documented.  There are also lots of movies about pedophilia and structural coverups, for example Spotlight (Catholic Church), just to name one.  There are so many well-documented cases:  Saville, Sandusky, Franklin, Detroux, the list goes on and on.  Lots of things we can use to bring awareness.</p>
<p>By bringing up 1., I\'m hoping that we would force the enemy to go even more defensive.  How can you defend against the many accurate stories that are already out there?  The only thing they can do is hide these stories.  Mocking them will be difficult.  And it will be easier to defend if we keep our cool.  If MSM start to look like pedophile protectors, god help them from the wave of angry mothers that will descend upon them.  Phase 1. is delicate, because let\'s face it, pedophilia is something that inspires disgust in most people.  But we would have the moral high ground here, easy to defend, and easy to demonstrate (lots of legitimate news and documentaries on this).  Our goal will be to get everyone talking about these crimes.</p>
<p>Once we are sure the first phase has altered the conversation appropriately (not sure how to determine this), we start phase 2.  Phase 2 builds on Phase 1.   Phase 1 got everyone realizing this stuff is still happening and there is ample evidence.  Phase 2 will help people realize the conclusion that the government is complicit.  Not all of the government, but certain individuals, and that there are perverse incentives for people not to rat out the pedos.</p>
<p>It is people\'s simplistic thought process that lets them breath a sigh of relief after the movie is over.  But they will start to realize that this is ongoing, and there are people in charge behind it.</p>
<p>Once people are talking about people in government who protect pedophile networks, getting people to believe pizzagate will be easier.  At that point, it sounds plausible, because we\'ve established this is a problem in many countries (could it be one in ours?  of course), and that some corrupt officials are involved.  The only question then will be the particulars of the involvement - Is John Podesta involved or not?  Is the CF involved?</p>
<p>My thought is by going at this obliquely, we can gain even more traction, allowing people to take a more moderate stance, while moving people slowly toward the obvious conclusion.  Going oblique will put the enemy into an uncomfortable position, and open a new front in this war.</p>
