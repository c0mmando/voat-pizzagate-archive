Perhaps I can explain this in more detail. Recently the Lansing State Journal put out a story that told about how Michigan State paid Precision Strategies Consulting firm to track the social media accounts of victims of their Larry Nassar child abuse scandal. <a href="https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/local/2018/03/28/msu-spent-500-k-january-monitor-social-media-accounts-nassar-victims-others/447378002/">https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/local/2018/03/28/msu-spent-500-k-january-monitor-social-media-accounts-nassar-victims-others/447378002/</a> <a href="http://archive.is/jJHyc">http://archive.is/jJHyc</a> Precision Technologies would monitor how big an impact various victim\'s posts had. One has to assume that Michigan State wouldn\'t pay this firm just so they could look at the data and say, &quot;That\'s interesting.&quot; No, MSU wanted this data to at least spin their press releases. You could speculate that they wanted the data to find ways to target the victims but that might be going to far. </p>
<p>Now, according to the Podesta emails, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39610">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39610</a> <a href="http://archive.is/S6SD4">http://archive.is/S6SD4</a>, Heather Samuelson, who was working for Cheryl Mills, contacted Precision Stategies about working for Hillary Clinton. A Political campaign hiring social media consulting firms is nothing new. However, if Michigan State trusted this company enough to help them manage their response to their child sex scandal, could it be that Precision Strategies helped in finding the response to pizzagate?</p>
<p>Maybe this is another rabbit hole, or it could just be interesting but irrelevant. Either way, I thought it should be mentioned on this subverse.</p>',
