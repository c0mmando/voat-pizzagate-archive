             Patch Adams was just an example and noted in the title. If you haven't watched the video yet you might find other items of interest, and I didn't realize it until

             posted it but Patch Adams is associated with Droop Mountain.

              "DROOP MOUNTAIN, WVA – In an interview with Alfred Lambremont Webre, Panel members author and researcher Ole Dammegard and child abuse expert Dr. Julieann Pankey-Mamula, PhD exposed further elements of reported underground pedocriminal facility at Droop Mountain Battlefield State Park, WVA.
             </p>
             <p>
              These include extensive tunneling and the adjacent proximity of the Droop Mountain pedocriminal facility to a Children’s Center, the Gesundheit! Institute, founded &amp; directed by media figure Patch Adams, MD, featured in a motion picture starring the late Robin Williams, a state correctional facility &amp; an air strip, all preconditions that researcher Ole Dammegard stated his CIA whistleblower consultant Chip Tatum reported were indications of a clandestine black ops site with pedocriminal connections."

              Not sure if you found it yet in the archived but Alfred Webre (seen on the video with Ole Dammegard) 
on Droop Mountain is the brother of Septimbre Webre. He was seen in pictures with James Alefantis. He was the director of Washington Ballet but left suddenly as this was all breaking in December. The Webre's are deep CIA family....do not know what Alfred knows.

              I just searched again but can't find a seriously disturbing piece Wavy Gravy wrote about himself. It's started with hi Im wavy gravy i smoke ciggarettes and i swear...and I have cancer...its was a page long I showed to the court- they fucking so so so changed up my file tho- like when I go to look at docs I filed with the family court...wow not there! And all the files the originals that were ordered as everything has to be original with the court-  we're copied off on blue papers and combined with my child support case documents all in one giant book. They took my contributions reorganised them deleted stuff and kept only the blue copies tjey made. Thats what director kim turner was beimg investigated for. Shredding files. Her and merideth braden bev woods et al. Anyway i may have the wavy gravy self proclaimed ciggarettes smoker with cancer who swears hard copy in my stuff. But some techy nerd should be able to find it. I don't have a computer. It was there. I did not know about Pizzagate at that time I was panicky about my own child being involved!

               Unsettling cause there are photos of my kid with patch Adams I have seen, from camp winnatainbow. I was so disturbed about everything about the camp when my kids dad forced thru court that I allow my kid go to the camp. When i saw the closeness between her dad a newly transgender woman, and wavy and patch, I just hoped that it was a good thing not a bad thing. What the fuck is a cancer dr. Doing hanging out with filthy hippie druggie fucking weirdos??? So tripped out and disturbed. The tranny has my kid. Has her mind controlled to avoid me. I have not seen her in over two years. Birthday is next month this is not real life for ME this is just some kind of extortion.

                What a nightmare. If you've not recently consulted with a family law attorney, I encourage you to request a free consultation. Most will offer an initial case review at no charge. Before you even start calling around to do that, collect every piece of documentation you can get your hands on. As for your own personal recollection, write it out. Request a friend to input it into a computer in order to print it out for legibility purposes. Organize, organize, organize. The main reason for this is that you want the biggest bang possible for that initial consultation and they won't give you much time for it. Think like a lawyer-- present the facts you know and try as much as possible to leave out the conjecture, which will be hard because this is a highly charged and emotional personal situation. But try. And then, after presenting the attorney with the outline of your evidence, (you might practice this first, seriously) request their opinion on what your legal options are. If you have a case, and they offer to take it, be clear on what they charge. And if you don't have the money, ask if they'll consider taking it pro bono.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you don't have a child custody case against your ex spouse, then consider alternate (but legal) options such as making your story public. If you do this, be prepared for a smear campaign. And refer to the same bank of evidence you collected for the attorneys.
               </p>
               <p>
                And above all, be careful. If you've bumped into a child sex trafficking ring, those people, as you already know, are not playing a game. Be safe.

                 Im at stage above all be careful. I have done everything you have suggested all ready. Basically spent my inheritance from my grandfather who had been so thought full to leave money -on lawyers over 12 years. Meanwhile never filing a motion for custody, just reponding to endless frivolous motions that would end in custody changes. Starting with Marin family and children's law center who I thought would be good cause cheaper. Wow. Kris Kirby the director is a ghoul or toad. Seriously. Anyway in 08 they dropped my case without any explanation.  other lawyers i got subsequently had me press for a reason why. When i did theu called sherrif on me. I geuss I had realized they were in on it, that it wasnt ending, they like court cause it's money for them. They are all pregnant too! Anyway after that I paid thru the nose all the while Perry Taubman represented the tranny probono. After several more years of that and after finding the trannys porn for sale young people etc..website online, I documented that with police but, #1258 is all i have ever seen of the report ultimately they say my own police report and their investigation findings are confidential and it's not illegal to sell.porn. I have been active online however this guygirl daddy is way more active than me. I responded to some shit he wrote on anselmo patch hyper local blog, so did my brother. He had written something like how sick snd twisted me and my brother are the kid doesnt even want me and that the courts know it. So i wrote a comment. It was long and addressed no one in particular except the general public as a fair warning about the people like my childs dad and the Marin family court being corrupt etc.. He then deleted all of his own comments and proceeded to take me to court for STALKING HIM ONLINE and because that judge is the same fam court judge who hates me Beverley Woods, she granted him a 5 year restraining order against me, but here's the real sick and twisted part. Around that same time I went to my "visitation" which had been so curtailed but I arrived on the wrong day of the court order at my kids school. So he coupled the online stalking charge with stalking of a minor child. And was granted a five year restraining order against me which also keeps me away no contact with my kid. I have been so sick behind this happening. I went to the police of  the town of her school and over two years of fighting with the Sarg there he finally wrote a report about what really happened that day and cleared my name. It says how he researched and found I never committed any crime ever let alone stalking. It was hard to get him to write cause he knows bev woods - has to see her probably alot and i think its very scary for him. After he wrote that report tho i felt better a little. Because in family court they get away with calling you crazy and a criminal, but in life you are the good parent . The patch Adams stuff is so disturbing cause they were all there together at that camp and I couldn't understand why he dad was forcing me to let her go, 7 year old is too young even by the camps own rules. And there are pictures of my kid with patch Adams and sick fuck gravy.. now I haven't seen my kid in more than two years. The lawyers here are ALL corrupt and it's  $900 to apeal a restraining order. I've just been waiting for her to break free from mental chains, everyone says she will. But everyday is hard for me. Imagine that i am the one to have gone to the county for help. Im the one from this county. So no wonder Im being harvested.

            Patch Adams is also based on an "alleged" children's doctor connected to Droop Mountain. Research this.

              Yes there has been a lot of research on Droop Mountain here on Voat and I have mentioned the Patch Adams connection before. It is archived you should be able to find it.

             Shilling kind of loses it's effectiveness when it is so obvious. But I guess only otherwise unemployable degenerates are willing to do the work so they can't be picky.
