            I wholeheartedly agree with everything you said, unfortunatley I have such a hectic life at the moment that i cant contribute in terms of investigating new leads and adding to the cause but I make sure i keep up to date with stuff everyday. Call me a cheerleader if you will. I have been trying to shove red pills up peoples ass on twitter recently but some of the brainwashed Liberal ass holes are just too much to deal with sometimes and i have to remind myself not to get angry, not everyone has the mindset to digest this reality we live in. Keep up the superb work guys we are all in this together

            It was someone else that was set on fire, some kid. But for some reason that anchor used his co-workers name. Weird shit. Maybe it was a message being delivered to Dana. Plausible deniability is he didn't pause between two unrelated sentences, all that coffee hehe.

            Rank and file journalists are NOT the enemy.  It's the
            <strong>
             editors and executives

            who are censoring the truth.  The effect of OP's post would be to make rank and file journalists feel antagonism toward us.  Flairing as possible false flag.

            The fourth estate has failed the people miserably. They've been turned from an entity who keeps the government checked/balanced into slithering tentacles for propaganda of the powers that be.
           </p>
           <p>
            To be fair, you can't completely blame the journalists because at the end of the day they are just people like you and me who went to school, took on massive financial debt, struggled to find a job, bought a house, financed a car, feed their kids, and hope for some level of security in their lives. By the time they actually get into a position where they can make a difference they are so woven and crushed into the system of financial and social servitude, they find themselves serving their masters only so they can keep a roof over their house and their children and extended family comfortable and with a modicum of happiness. They get swallowed like the rest of us.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, having said that... There is nothing barring any journalist with a shred of decency from anonymously participating in PG8 investigations. Their expertise and networks could launch this thing far further forward and any of us individually could do. An anon journalist could start an anonymous blog, or YouTube channel and bring their skills to a medium they are skilled at. There is nothing preventing a journalist from leaking critical information here, or on a chan, or to wikileaks that would show how corrupt and twisted the media environment is, or what leads they have which are prevented from releasing on MSM formats.
           </p>
           <p>
            Instead of being slithering failures
            <strong>
             any
            </strong>
            journalist could follow their conscience and step away from the boa constrictor of servitude.

            they're narcissists, complete stuck up assholes who don't have a shred of sympathy. I pity them in some way that they ended up like this, whatever innocence that was left in them died a long time ago...

            Yes some have their hands tied, if they go against the current agenda they're going to lose their jobs, or hell even be blacklisted in the industry. Please, if there are those in the MSM that are reading this and can share any suspicious evidence concerning pedophillia, create an anonymous account and share your findings.

            Yeah, whatever is going on at their workplace, there's nothing stopping them creating anonymous groups, or even just as themselves under a pen name, writing articles and buoying up the citizen investigation with insider view-points and tips.

            At the end of the day a journalist still has to feed his kids and pay the bills. I partly agree with you but sometimes other things are more important. It's not always that simple.

            I hope I'm wrong, but I can't help but think that the most successful and visible "journalists"/news readers are sociopaths/narcisists who care only about themselves and their careers. That's
            <strong>
             why
            </strong>
            they succeed and are visible! They are ready and willing to say and do anything that will advance themselves, which generally means saying and doing anything that advances their masters. A decent person would speak up and get shot down enough to become discouraged and either fall silent or even move on to another career. A sad situation, but what can we do? Is there a news organization we "little people" can get behind, support, and reward for its honesty?

              They are. A lot of writers/journos contribute to these blogs and even Voat. Remember they are just above average intelligence people. That's all. Obviously, their discoveries aren't going to be accepted by the Times or BBC editorial directors, are they? They don't have magic bullet solutions to all the problems of the world just because they're a journalist. And why would they give away their personal ID on Voat? Would the OP do it?
             </p>
             <p>
              The points of the OP just seem like bravado. I doubt he's done anything effective himself, while there are journos who had made significant breakthroughs. By definition, mainstream journos are gatekeepers or "I'm all right Jack" types. But we know that. Let's say a trade magazine writer, or copywriter by trade, is contributing anonymously on Voat. Do they deserve abuse?
             </p>
             <p>
              Again, the Forth Estate are part of the problem - but everyone knows that. So what's your point?

            They don't feel. It's common knowledge that high-functioning MKs are placed in these positions. Normal people wouldn't be able to blatantly lie like they do without having a crisis of consciousness. Their compartmentalized minds protect them from that.

              'MK' is used as shorthand to refer to people who have been in some kind of program like this. It's seems to be way more than I originally suspected.

              some
             </strong>
             journalists are conscience-free sociopaths. Most of the rest are simply
             <strong>
              incompetent.

              Same here.  In one case I was interviewed about my business for several hours only to have 45 seconds show up on the episode.  20 of those seconds were taken up with a shot of one of my half empty displays.  Still not sure who was to blame there but the reporter had a very...false? Plastic? vibe about her.

              I've been interested in why Journalism quality has gone so far downhill and heard a theory that with an increase in Journalism graduates over the years, competition rose and lowered the value of the position which led to incompetent people taking the jobs for such low pay.
             </p>

              <a href="http://www.grady.uga.edu/annualsurveys/Graduate_Survey/Graduate_2012/Grdrpt2012mergedv2.pdf">
               This journalism study
              </a>
              has some evidence for and against that claim, but it mostly seems to indicate that the highest paying positions are with the government and that there has been a severe increase in online/mobile journalism jobs. I assume the online media, with the advantage of nearly free distribution focuses on quantity over quality and that's why we see such shit journalism today.
             </p>

              Then again...this study was conducted by journalists haha

               Anyway, the pathetically low post-graduation employment rate (discussed in the article you linked) should mitigate against hacks: Only the cream of the crop

               My guess is that the incompetence of most journalists is a combination of (a) pressure from editors to skew the story, which is difficult to do effectively when the data from interviews say something else, (b) the lack of time to carefully listen and think critically about what the data are saying, due to the need to publish so much in so little time, and (c) the general decline in critical thinking skills among the American population, due to so many many factors that include our crap educational system, our damaged attention span, our inability to trust sources or to discern when a source is trustworthy, and so many other factors.

                Thanks, one in return for you. Most of the journalism majors I knew in college cared more for the fame than the facts. Although I doubt this is any different than journalism majors from 50 years ago, I agree that the medium of information, increased competition, and lack of attention are all contributing to the decline of factual reporting.

                There's a small sect of libertarian thinkers who believe the public education system has purposefully made our population worse at critical thinking and more worried about social injustices to support the need-for-big-government narrative.

                 Hm, I'm not sure that the destruction of our kids' critical thinking skills is necessarily intentional, but I do think there are teachers unions and other institutions that care far more for themselves than for our kids.

            No one's hands are tied. There's always a choice. As long as there are so-called journalists working in an industry where they're doing to their audience what pedophiles do to children, their techniques of manipulation, hell on earth is guaranteed.

            I agree completely. It is also important to step our game up, and become an activist organisation

             Hmm... I'm not so sure that's exactly right.  However, it isn't entirely wrong either.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've been thinking about where we are as a society.  We're (FINALLY!!!) exiting the censorship/gatekeeping age and entering... what?  With the loss of Big Media's ability to control the minds of the masses, what is it that will tie us together now?  And that begs two questions: will
             <em>
              anything
             </em>
             tie us together? and, is there truly an "us" any more to begin with?
            </p>
            <p>
             Without Big Media doing it, what will provide the "gravitational center" of society's thoughts?  Will there be anything doing that?  Nature abhors a vacuum, but is the censorship age the norm, or has it been an aberration?  If the former, we're bound to land on something else that will provide intellectual cohesion.  If the latter... then I don't know what to expect, at all.
