<p>Gustav Ahr, aka rapper Lil Peep, a budding star whose emotional, downtrodden lyrics gained a cult following online, died of a suspected drug overdose. He was 21.</p>
<p>Gustav Åhr was born on 1 st November 1996 Pennsylvania, mother was German - Irish teacher in an elementary school and father was a German-Swedish professor in a university. He grew up on Long Island and, as a teenager, attended the local high school he dropped at age 17. He began his musical career at the same time and posted his music on YouTube and SoundCloud. After graduating from online classes, he moved to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>A New York Times critic places his songs between hip hop and emo , and calls him Kurt Cobain of the SoundCloud rap scene.</p>
<p>His first album, Come Over When You\'re Sober, is released in August 2017. Lil Peep publicly revealed his bisexuality simultaneously.</p>
<p>On November 16, 2017, the media announce his death from an overdose. The singer had been found the day before in the bus of his tour in Tucson . There are indications that he died after taking Xanax.</p>

<p>As you may be able to surmise, &quot;Lil Peep&quot; focused on <em>youth</em> and <em>\'youthfulness\'</em> with a <strong>grunge/rap edge</strong>, melding the type of performers that would perhaps, be the type to play at <strong>Comet Ping Pong</strong>, and the once predominantly black genre of rap.</p>

           As you may be able to surmise, "Lil Peep" focused on
           <em>
            youth
           </em>
           and
           <em>
            'youthfulness'
           </em>
           with a
           <strong>
            grunge/rap edge
           </strong>
           , melding the type of performers that would perhaps, be the type to play at
           <strong>
            Comet Ping Pong
           </strong>
           , and the once predominantly black genre of rap.
          </p>
          <p>
           In fact, in December of 2015, he released his album debut through
           <strong>
            Bandcamp
           </strong>
           ,
           <em>

              I geuss so it feels weird. I was just talking on the melanin thing, I never knew that before.  I made a post and twice it was deleted, 3rd time it stayed up, I referenced my post maybe that's not allowed? I didn't link it. But my post was about me being suspicious of the Toyota ad. I saw recently, my post links it, where there's black people and pizza. Black people and pizza..  hmm clinton  foundation donating, marina abromovic service using,, John McCain driving Toyota ad that features pizzain 3fast paced scenes and tome thats a red flag. that's all I'm trying to talk about. It's been weird. I appreciate your post.

            This is why I posted about the 3 pizza scenes in the newest Toyota ad. And the song sung by Paul cena which means dinner. The words- your time is up my time is now you can't see me it's the franchise I'm shining with. It shows black guy and girl and pizza.  Of all the red flags anymore, but I never knew that melanin is prised for value in human meat. There you go, in how to spot a vampire. And how do you tell black people this without giving them nightmares?

              I'm sorry you feel that way but no. Report me if you feel the need. People comment MUCH worse on voat posts &amp; I refuse to CENSOR my speech or the truth which is the reason I canned fascistbook &amp; twatter &amp; came to voat. I don't ever use this word unless it's absolutely warrented &amp; in this case it is.  Nigger isn't a racist term because it doesn't refer to color but a personality type. That much should be obvious seeing this creature is white.

            Nice job. Glad someone covered this. I saw the death announcement and took a quick look and the signs were all there that is was one of the misfits produced by indoctrination, satanic allegiance, and abuse/rape/torture. What's really sad is that they think they're going to get ahead and be at the top of the gameplaying board. Don't they know that the top dogs are already chosen? Unless something happens, they stay in that pecking order so you sell your soul for nothing. The slightest problem and you're dispensed with.
           </p>
           <p>
            Life, innocence, the soul mean nothing to these people. They are heartless and have no such thing as remorse.

               Most human beings only learn through repetition, so I try to make it a point to hammer it home a few times in a couple different ways lol, so yeah sorry 4 the repetition but I'll say many things a number of times so that people get it right.

             There's some type of trap out there designed for each and every one of us. We all fall into our own vice based on this mass form of conditioning. We are fallible and a highly suggestible species and our current conditioning automatically ensures rapid dysfunction. What we are seeing with each successive generation is a concentrated effort at creating the perfected demon and unempathetic sociopath willing to disregard anything in it's path mad max style.

               His parents in some way played a large role in creating this monster.  I don't see how it's even possible for a kid whose parents were professors and elementary teachers to turn out like this, without totally botching their child rearing.

            I see the hotdog and 666 reference. Is the A with a circle around it supposed to be the pizzagate reference? I think that's a stretch. It all looks demonic. It's really sad. But I don't see the pizzagate part at 2:19.

            Speaking of black children, I wonder why Laura Silsby &amp; Hillary wanted those Haitians kids so much. Maybe some voodoo link. There was opportunity because of disasters &amp; poverty but Hillary seems to like Haiti a lot.

             I really have pondered on this a lot, and I think it may be for the way black people tend to not age. They tend to keep a very youthful and vibrant look to them well into their elder years.  This must be good for transfusion and organs.

             There is some supposed special property of their increased levels of melanin. I don't have any more information; but recall reading that, somewhere.
