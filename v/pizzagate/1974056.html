<p>the 21st district recall election of Republican Sen.Van Wanggard, who was challenged by Democrat former state Sen. John Lehman.</p>
<p>First, election day reports from poll observers. These include voters being allowed to register at the poll with identification that did
 not have a name on it. In some cases, they were allowed by poll workers to use things like a receipt from Jiffy Lube that had no
 name on it. Others used coupon mailers or other mail simply addressed to &quot;occupant.&quot; These things could easily be taken from another person\'s garbage or a local dumpster.</p>
<p> One poll observer tried to challenge a voter\'s registration and the poll worker handed the voter a ballot anyway. Once the voter is given a ballot, that voter can no longer be challenged. The poll worker claimed they did not understand what was going on. 
We have reports of vans with Illinois license plates bringing voters to the polls. Veteran poll watchers claimed many more 
people used same day registration than a usual high turnout election. </p>
<p> The radical leftist group Voces de la Frontera, in conjunction with Racine Unified School District (or at least with it\'s blessing)
 was allowed to take 350 to 400 high school students out of class and on school time to canvass the lowest turn out, and highly
 Democrat wards in a get out the vote effort on election day. Voces said that they turned out 1,200 to 1,300 votes. Voces also
 claimed they had a non-partisan message, but others say their vans were covered in partisan signage.</p>
<p>The Martin Luther King Jr. Center polling location in Racine had a very large Obama \'08 poster hanging on the wall, even though political advertising like this is not supposed to be allowed in the poll. Also at this polling location, election observers watched a woman wearing a blue fist t-shirt escort many voters in and out of the poll. </p>
<p>When the election observer objected, the poll workers said this was not a violation, even though this is clearly a known political symbol advocating for the leftist unions. A person wearing such political stuff, even a candidate\'s button should not be allowed to linger in the polling place or within 100 feet of the entrance under state law.</p>
<p> An election observer watched a woman at the MLK Jr. Center polling place enter, register, and vote three different times
. On the third time, the observer challenged the vote, the chief poll worker ignored the challenge and gave this two time
 voter a third ballot.An election observer watched a woman at the MLK Jr. Center polling place enter, register, and vote three different times. On the third time, the observer challenged the vote, the chief poll worker ignored the challenge and gave this two time voter a third ballot.</p>
<p> At Festival Hall in Racine, a female poll observer watched a man in a blue fist t-shirt repeatedly enter and exit the poll with voters. After the observer questioned this man coming in and out of the poll, he reportedly threatened to &quot;smash her head in the ground.&quot; It was also reported this man was given a $400 citation for doing this.</p>
<p> This picture is of a van used by the leftist union front Wisconsin Jobs Now to bring in voters to the polls. It has the word &quot;cash&quot; painted on the rear window. Considering these vans were working low income areas, the lure of cash could have proved a strong motivation to vote. It is illegal to pay a person to vote. This picture is of a van used by the union groups to pick up people in low income areas and take them to the polls. As you can clearly see, it has a Recall Walker sign, and  Blue 5 signs on the side. Blue 5 is the fist symbol used by the unions. This van also has loud speakers on top which were reported to have played a speech from Rev. Jessie Jackson. We have no way to know if these loud speakers were also used to call out to people on the street and offer compensation for voting.
At the State St. Transit Center in Racine, a jammed voting machine was opened, the ballots were removed and shuffled around by poll workers (video here). According to witness, the replacement machine was started at ballot 671 instead of number 1 as it should have been. </p>
<p> All of this evidence is mostly anecdotal, you either believe it or not. But the one thing it does do is present a picture of consistency, what police would refer to as a pattern of behavior. Adding to this pattern of behavior are solid, verified, reports that back these stories up.
 It has been reported that at least 78 of the 189 poll workers in Racine had signed the recall petitions of both Gov. Walker and Sen. Wanggaard. Eight of the 17 poll workers at the Cesar Chavez Community Center polling location, including the Chief Election Inspector, had signed the recall petitions.
MacIver News Service reported the Racine County Sheriff\'s Department is investigating the discovery of election related documents
 found in a dumpster behind the Cesar Chavez Community Center, an official polling location in Racine. This is a Democrat
 leaning ward. The documents were blank and partially filled out registration forms that had been pre-certified by an election
 official. The election official is supposed to witness the voter filling out these forms, then sign them. Partisan political literature
 was also found and this is not supposed to be allowed in a polling location.</p>
<p> Also from MacIver, more than 4000 people used same day registration in the City of Racine. This adds credence to the poll 
watchers accounts of higher than usual turnout for these type voters. Upwards of half of these voters did not sign the poll list
 as required by law. The Democrat controlled Government Accountability Board has chalked this up to clerical errors.  </p>
<p> Many media sources have reported that it has been discovered that 9 of the 36 ballot bag\'s seals in Racine used to deliver the
 ballots from the wards to the city clerk, who then is to deliver them to the county clerk had been tampered with. The purpose
 of sealing these bags is to keep the integrity of the ballots and establish a chain of custody of these ballots. </p>
<p> These ballot bags were delivered to the Racine city clerk, who then delivered them to the county clerk. The 9 bags in question 
had their seals broken when they reached the county clerk. The county clerk rejected these ballot bags with broken seals. The
 bags were returned to the city clerk. </p>
<p> The Racine city clerk then put the broken seal ballot bags into a second bag and sealed them a second time. When these bags were returned to the Racine County clerk, they were accepted and counted. The chain of custody of these bags is completely
 unknown and what happened to the ballots is unknown, yet these ballots were then counted. </p>
<p> These 9 wards from where the broken seal bags came from went this way for the Democrat Lehman, 52.8%, 53.5%, 61%,
 63.4%, 72.4%, 73.8%, 78.1%, 82.2%, 91.2%. These are also some of the same wards that had some of the other problems
 I described earlier.</p>
<p> In the 21st district there were over 72,000 total votes cast. While it was close, Gov. Walker won the vote in Racine County. 
Yet Lehman won ? I find it hard to believe that people who came out and voted for Gov. Walker, to defend him against the 
recall, would turn around and vote to recall Sen. Wanggaard.</p>
<p> The 21st district was the last district to report. These questionable wards in Racine were late reporting. All of the problems in Racine County happened in the City of Racine. All of the problems in Racine happened in these late reporting, questionable wards.
 This is troubling.</p>
<p> The last issue is this. Once it became clear very late election night after the initial vote count that Lehman had won by just 
over 800 votes out of 72,000 cast, Lehman was much more interested in demanding Sen.Wanggaard concede . </p>
<p> Lehman went on  media source who would listen to him to demand Wanggaard
 concede. What was Lehman\'s rush ? Why was it so important to him for Wanggard to concede ? , </p>
<p> The one reason why Lehman wanted Wanggaard to concede is because it ends any calls for recounts or other legal challenges. Later, Lehman\'s liberal surrogates in the media would also demand Wanggaard concede, just as some of these reports of voter
 irregularities were beginning to surface. </p>
<p> I see a person and a media who may not know exactly what went on, 
but they have a good idea of what went on and they have a strong motivation to not let these things be exposed. Because
 it is clear now that a lot of things, questionable things, went on in Racine during this election, and these things can be pin
 pointed down to a few wards in the city.</p>
<p> While any one or even two of these irregularities could be brushed aside, when one takes it all in, it is obvious some 
serious shenanigans were going on in Racine during the recall election. I will exclude liberals from the following, but if 
any decent, logical thinking person looks at the preponderance of evidence presented here, I do not think they can honestly 
say there was not an organized, large scale effort to steal this election through fraud. And I think that is exactly what these
 left wing groups have done with the support of loyal Democrats who either looked the other way or were directly complicit in the act.</p>

            Racine is an experimental hub for sustainable development, community policing, education reform, viruses and vaccines, sanctuary city status, social justice, fake news, rigged development and elections, and the more nefarious side of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine is also one of the main 13 Bellwether districts in the nation that serve as a barometer for the state and nation.

            I just have one question.  If Paul Ryan is so very much at the head of what is going on in Racine, why are the Dems allowed to get away with this and how did Walker win when there was so much Election Fraud going on?  I counter that the Republicans were doing just as much Fraud   They are both fighting probably to take over and keep the power in Racine.  There is plenty of this kind of blame on both sides, imo.

             They hedge both sides. The parties are an illusion. The RNC and DNC both have deep ties to Racine, and the only goal is to control both sides of the establishment. Follow the money and you will find out who is controlling them, and how Reince Priebus, Scott Walker and Paul Ryan became so powerful for no reason. They work for the mafia.

              And all three of them were Boy Scouts.  As if the Boy Scouts are not in enough hot water for abuse.  When the news hits about their involvement I shudder to think what will happen to all the boys that have loved being Scouts.  But with all the other things that you have mentioned that may be the least of our problems.  The parade in Racine with Knights of Pythias reminds me of one in St. Luis Mo. given by another Secret Society.  They are everywhere all across the country.
