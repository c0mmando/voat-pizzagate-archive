            The origin of the McCann efits is actually somewhat mysterious. They were made in late 2008, but not released to the public until 2013. They seem to have been the work of Henri Exton, a former MI5 agent employed by a private investigation company hired by the McCanns and their benefactor, Brian Kennedy. They are said to have been produced based on the eyewitness testimony of an Irish couple who caught a brief glimpse of a single man carrying a child in Portugal on the evening of Madeleine's disappearance. It seems unlikely that they could have given an accurate description of the man.
           </p>
           <p>
            There has been extensive scrutiny of the matter (though not in relation to pizzagate).

             So the question is, why would Exton (who appears to be quite a dodgy character, at best) produce two sketches of allegedly the SAME person that happen to look exactly like two DIFFERENT people - the Podesta brothers? They're close enough to be tampered photos. I agree that the Martins couldn't have produced anything so specific from the limited glimpse they reported, and I suspect that the Martins may just have wanted to 'get in on the action to see what was in it for them' - 15 minutes of fame and all that. I've been mulling over this and have come up with nothing but speculations involving Clement Freud, Exton, Kennedy, MI5, blackmail opportunities, 'British National Security', and the so-very-obviously-smelly coverup of facts in the McCann case.
