<p>I just did some tests and found that Twitter is often showing the most-recent tweet as being from March 26 (two days ago). When it shows more recent results (using the Latest sort), it will only show some of these for a short period, and then they will no longer display. I have seen it literally scrub tweets I had just read if I refresh the screen. It is an obvious effort to keep a lid on this topic, keep it from trending, and limit the exposure of the issue to the broader public. The most Twitter may allow is for those who already have posted on the tag to see the postings of others, but even that is being censored in tests that I ran...where zero of my posts using this tag are showing, and I have zero notifications/responses from multiple tweets related to #missingdcgirls. I had tweeted to people specifically engaged in this topic, including some of my followers.</p>
<p>EDIT: I will further explain what I have been observing. It is very insidious. You don\'t know what you DON\'T see. They block and ban in ways that are not obvious to most. It can be discovered by opening multiple tabs and comparing results over time. Open a tab, and do a search (on Latest). Keep the tab open and refresh after 20 minutes. 20 minutes later, open a second tab and repeat the process to refresh. No scroll down and compare results from the same time period. You will see that they do not perfectly match as some of the tweets will just be done (when looking in the same time window).</p>
<p>The bigger level of censorship involves shadow banning, in which tweets are simply not displayed at all for some people (or are limited to followers with small followings). This censorship is hard to see and gets discovered by those who are shadow banned and then try to find their own tweets, only to find that they are not displayed. If they shadow ban, it is hard to detect because if you search for your tweets while logged into your account, it will show them (but only to you). You don\'t realize that the public cannot see them. However, if you log out and do the same search, you will find they do not show. Twitter is falsely leading those they shadow ban to believe that their messages get posted, but they basically put them into a database where only the sender can see them (when logged in).</p>
<p>To prove this, look at this example. Just yesterday, this account (obamatruth1) put out 18 tweets related to #missingdcgirls.</p>
<p>Go to Twitter advanced search (<a href="https://twitter.com/search-advanced?lang=en">https://twitter.com/search-advanced?lang=en)</a>) and search on this hashtag #missingdcgirls and &quot;From these account&quot; enter obamatruth1. You will see that it shows ZERO results despite the fact that 18 such tweets were sent from that account yesterday</p>
<p>Edit2 (3/29/17): The Twitter censorship is broader for those with a message threatening the established pedocracy. The focus of this account (obamatruth1) is to expose #PizzaGate/#PedoGate, so now an advanced search on ANY tweets put out by obamatruth1, without ANY other filters, produces ZERO results: Silenced!

            You need to switch to "Latest". I did that and am seeing results from 1m 15m 20m 20m and 34m. I assume the lack of tweets is because it's early morning right now in North America.

             Thank you for the reply and input. You are correct about the sorting, and my initial post was clumsy in explaining what I was seeing. I was observing tweets that would show, and it you refreshed, some of them would be gone (when you scrolled down to the time they were sent). This is not obvious unless you open to tabs to compare results, showing that some that had shown were missing. The bigger issue is shadow banning. I explain it at length later in this post, but here is a way to see it:

             It is very insidious. You don't know what you DON'T see. They block and ban in ways that are not obvious to most. It can be discovered by opening multiple tabs and comparing results over time. It also gets discovered by those who are shadow banned and then try to find their own tweets, only to discover they are not displayed. If they shadow ban, it is hard to detect because if you search for your tweets while logged into your account, it will show them. However, if you log out and do the same search, you will find they do not show. Twitter is falsely leading those they shadow ban to believe that their messages get posted, but they basically put them into a database where only the sender can see them (when logged in).
            </p>
            <p>
             To prove this, look at this example. Just yesterday, this account (obamatruth1) put out 18 tweets related to #missingdcgirls.
            </p>
            <p>
             Go to Twitter advanced search (

             The issue is reach. The same holds for google. Until the masses move off of these plaforms, we need strategies to reach theb humdreds of millions who do.

             Yes, but they ARE filtering. They blocked all 18 tweets I posted today  on #MissingDCGirls. This is 100% provable for all to see. I discuss it in other parts of this thread.

             While some of this is from what we would call leftists, we should be totally non-partisan going after this evil, as there are many on the left who are comrades in this fight. Many of the evil doers are from the "right" Side of the aisle. Nonpartisan outreach is a part of our strategy to engage those who currently view this is purely a witchhunt against Hillary, which is literally true but does not limit the scope as we will go after any pedo in the GOP with the same rigor.

            It possible CIA/NSA has access to Twitter and is doing this? I don't know anything about it, just curious b/c it seems so hard to believe that the company would have interest in suppressing the search for missing girls.

            Yes.  Twitter is censoring as is GooTube.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet, for some reason, the "former" spook known as "George Webb," who is supposedly "busting these criminal rings wide open" and has supposedly been doing so for MONTHS, is STILL alive and STILL on GooTube!

             I too have been wondering why George Webb never suffers any censorship. The answer lies in whom he never mentions, in other words is there one entitiy / nation / agency that we know is part of the ring that he never mentions? That is who ensures he's not targeted. The only other possibility is he's up there to keep us all feeling totally confused and overwhelmed at the enormity of the global Dark State Mafia that runs the pedo/politician blackmail / organ harvesting / child sex ring / drug running. Webb does a good job at that.
            </p>
            <p>
             It has also occurred to me that he was raised pedo / MK Ultra or some such. He's got that brilliant, perfect, almost babbling genius quality. And the way blip! he just showed up on the scene. Has anyone been watching him for years?

              IMO, this is because he isn't drawing a ton of pedogate-specific attention. At least, not enough to trigger the Youtube and Twitter overlords (yet). People watch his videos and don't immediately hear about it and must presume it's just some nutty guy in front of his PC screen.
             </p>
             <p>
              That's just going off what I've viewed though, so I have limited experience in the matter.

              Is your twitter handle
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/vindicator">
               @vindicator
              </a>
              ? If so, they are shadow banning you. I just did an advanced search of your name and #missingdcgirls and got zero results:
              <a href="https://twitter.com/search?l=&amp;q=%23missingdcgirls%20from%3Avindicator&amp;src=typd&amp;lang=en">
               https://twitter.com/search?l=&amp;q=%23missingdcgirls%20from%3Avindicator&amp;src=typd&amp;lang=en
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              If you are logged in and do the same search, it might show your tweet. To really see this result (when they shadow ban), you need to do the search while logged out of your account (so that Twitter considers you the "general public"), in which case you will get zero results.

                OK. Glad to see that your tweets make it. They seem to be blocking anything I send. It is very strange as sometimes a search (while I am not logged in) produces zero results, and sometimes they show. Here is the search:

                  Could be. All I know is that my tweets will show but are not being delivered. I search now (when not logged in), and the search
                  <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;q=%40obamatruth1&amp;src=typd&amp;lang=en">
                   https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;q=%40obamatruth1&amp;src=typd&amp;lang=en
                  </a>
                  shows my tweets about this issue. It seems like they blocked it when I first sent them and then show them later, in this case, when time has passed. It is very provable that they are filtering as I have documented it.

             Twitter has begun singling out conservatives and banning them from its website.
            </li>
            <li>
             This type of political perspective is toxic for a potential buyer of Twitter.
            </li>
            <li>
             Firms want to avoid politics as much as possible. They don't want to take the risk of buying a firm with political leanings.
            </li>
            <li>
             The buyer could alienate its customers when Twitter makes a poor decision.

             We should consider a boycott of those who ADVERTISE on twitter. google, facebook, youtube as they are supporting platforms that ACTIVELY support pedophilia and PROTECTION of pedophiles. We have documented this and can easily prove the case. We need to noodle on this and try to find a way to make this public...a big challenge given the censorship by the LSM in even getting the idea of a boycott to reach the general public.

             Unsure, but that tag seems to have MUCH less activity than #missingdcgirls, so we should focus on that one (more inertia). I even broke up a link in one of my tweets to try to dodge the banning, but it did not seem to help. I posted: Twitter is censoring me. I am breaking up my link on DC Police paedo ring so that people can see. Google pizzagate/1752192 and hit top link.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have gotten zero notifications on 18 tweets. Normally, I will get a few on a single tweet (as I do not have a major following). I posted it in reply to many people who had tweeted specifically about #missingdcgirls, meaning that they are engaged. To receive silence in response means that they never saw it. I have run into this before and have documented the banning. It can be done by showing the tweet in your profile (so you think it went out) but by blocking it from view or display to all people...or sometimes those with large followings (a more insidious form of "shadow banning"). I did a test, and when I logged out of twitter and did a search of my tweets on a search of #missingdcgirls, I found 0 of 18! It is definitive proof. If we could make the black community aware of this, they will raise an uproar. They may pin it on racism, which is fine if this engages them in the first place, but they will soon discover that it is not a matter of the color of the victim but the status of the perp.

            Honestly, Twitter is barely useful as a platform for discussion anymore, especially with something like that because you know it incriminates the powers that shouldn't be.They want to push us to the fringes of the internet, so as to stop anyone from ever fighting for justice. They're doing it on nearly every major site now. This feels like it has Cass Sunstein written all over it.

            Someone should tweet this to Ava Duvernay, the American film director. She was the one who got all the celebrities involved, and she has tweeted several times about this. Don Cheadle, LL Cool J, all got this from her...

            I keep saying this, and I will continue: this shit will not stop until parents and regular citizens make it stop! I know we are all comfortable and lulled into this feeling of "safety", but when our children are being snatched, sold, tortured, and raped none of us are safe. It's getting close to a decision having to be made and we may need to start putting a stop to this ourselves.

             Very deep. I tweeted LL Cool J and TMZ this morning, and none of my tweets seems to have been delivered as I have seen zero activity from my many tweets on #missingdcgirls today. From my count, there should be thousands of tweets with this tag (#missingdcgirls). One technique they use is to show the tweet in the history for the person making the tweet, but the recipient will be blocked from seeing it...or filtered if they have a large following (say over 1000 people). I have witnessed this first hand.

               Yes. I wrote a thought piece on Reddit about what I saw to be an emerging pattern in which they were going to use the label "fake news" as a means to censor/block things they did not want us to see for the public good, and that they would specifically target pizzagate. I wrote this on 11/21/16, prior to any of the LSM hit pieces about pizzagate. The essay was immediately shadow banned on Reddit...a new concept to me that day...as people were telling me that my link produced no result even though I could read my post. Wouldn't you know that Reddit banned the entire pizzagate subreddit hours later, so my essay that no one saw was actually quite prophetic.

                Yes, I was shadow banned once and realized it after weeks. These people are scared. Illuminati in their books says that they must remain in secrecy until they control everything, but they are not ready yet, also Trump delayed their goals  and are getting exposed... Exposing them to all people is the worst for them...

               They are doing it for protection...either Jack Dorsey is a pedo...is protecting pedos for some reason (possible financial or due to his being compromised in some way)...or is threatened. We see the same with google, FB, and youtube. It is hard to know the motives for this as any normal person would NEVER block this kind of message. We KNOW that it is happening. The FACT that it is happening is some of the strongest evidence to those who have yet to come to the reality of #PedoGate. Tell your friends that they are censoring #SaveTheKids and #missingdcgirls as an indicator of how real this corruption is.

             that and they're trying to normalize it. It's one of the perversions that needs to be normalized in order for their agenda to work as planned.

             Yes. Just do a search of #missingdcgirls on Twitter, and see the results. When I search, it shows nothing from today. It then will show the new tweets over time as I stay on the page. I hit refresh, and all of the posts I was just looking at are gone. Based on just watching the activity before it gets wiped, #missingdcgirls should be trending. By censoring posts (which they have done to all of my tweets), shadow banning (hiding from people with large followings), and wiping them after a short window, they are trying to contain exposure to this...which means the DC pedo issue is VERY REAL. They only seem to invest in the blocking when we are digging in an area that has merit.

               I get that. My proof of the censorship is from two methods:
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Posted 18 tweets this morning related to #missingdcgirls...got zero response or notification. Searches, sorted by latest, showed 0 of my 18 tweets were displayed. I could only see this result when I logged out of Twitter. When I was logged in, I could see my tweets (giving the false sense that they were posted). By logging out, Twitter assumed I was the general public and not the poster of the tweets, so I saw zero results. I just checked it again with the same results.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 I did a search on #missingdcgirls. I then waited about 20 minutes and refreshed by clicking on the new notifications. I waited another 20 minutes and did another search on #missingdcgirls. When I compared results, I found that some tweets showed on one screen and not the other. When I tested, it seemed a bit random, but I was able to clearly see that the overlap of tweets between screens (within the same time frame) was not 100%, due to filtering.

                Alright, just making sure. It was working fine for me as far as I could tell, but they might be censoring based on location or who knows what else.

                 They censor individuals and also only show tweets to those with followings below a certain level...very subtle but effective censorship. Search the hashtag and omamatruth1. There should be 18 tweets from today, but you will find zero.

                 I can absolutely prove they are filtering. I personally made over a dozen tweets about this topic today. If I sort by latest, I find just one tweet. I also see tweets that will show and then not show later on the same search. I have been diligent to check. I just did a search on #missingdcgirls, and I saw that this tweet by MISTA12DoubleO (
                 <a href="https://twitter.com/REAL12HUNNIT/status/846769757697204224">
                  https://twitter.com/REAL12HUNNIT/status/846769757697204224)
                 </a>
                 ), which posted at 10:03 am in their time stamp (1:03 EDT) is not listed. The filtering seems random, but it is easy to catch if you open multiple screens and just do the search with some time in between. Or try to find any of the many tweets posted today by
                 <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/obamatruth1">
                  @obamatruth1
                 </a>
                 on a search of #missingdcgirls. Only 1 of 18 posted (between 8-9 am on the Twitter clock) shows. It will sometimes show and then be gone if you refresh and go back down to the same time frame. The amount of activity should be causing the #missingdcgirls hashtag to trend (about 50 tweets per hour that I can find despite the filtering I just proved), but it is not.

             I understand. The challenge is that #missingdcgirls has huge awareness and usage right now, and Twitter is doing all it can to undermine awareness. We invest in a new tag, and they will do the same. I have been using #SaveTheKids. I think exposing that Twitter is banning #missingdcgirls could be a huge viral message to break through as the calls for racism and opening of eyes have huge potential in awakening people right now who have been too ready to believe the lies of the LSM. It puts them in a bind since it involves people of color, and we should do all we can to bring them into the fold. They may falsely believe that the censorship is based on racism, which might even bring some social justice warriors who care about truth to join the fight. If it gets them involved in the efforts, it is to the good. They will soon see that the censorship is based on protecting the #pedoeilte. There still may be a racist element as there is strong evidence that they have exploited people from poor nations with children of color (Haiti, Latin America). This might be an angle that we can use to get some coverage in corporate media. I will work it.

              I so very much agree.  We must beat them at this game they are playing.  They have the money, but we have the army and the brains. When criminals are cornered they are like rats in a trap, no where to go.  We need to trap them.  We need to tweet at people of popularity that we know are on our side and urge them to get into the fight.  How about the Black Caucus?  Did they not send a letter to Jeff Sessions regarding the Missing Girls?

               Yes. I tweeted the CBC and BLM the other day with #missingdcgirls. Of course, since Twitter is clearly blocking me, I have no idea if it reached them.
              </p>
              <p>
               Please help to socialize this as Twitter is not allowing my tweets to show to anyone other than myself. Just tweet this:
              </p>
              <p>
               #missingdcgirls Strong evidence of pedo conspiracy/cover up w/in DC Police. Please check this out:

                I will try to mention spreading the message #missingdcgirls as much as possible anywhere they can.  My idea is that any black friends you may have, that people need to red pill them asap and let them know that they must spread this far and wide.  I have heard that BLM may have some connection to Soros, but am not sure.  We could email or write to people that are highly educated in the literary world and people we know that have a lot of moxie and spoken out.  I am talking about black people, for they need to get on board with this too, other than those living in DC.  They are starting to do a wonderful job but much more is needed.  We need to get them and us out into the streets.
