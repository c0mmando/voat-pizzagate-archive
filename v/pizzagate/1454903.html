  'formattedContent' => '<p>So let\'s first begin by stating the obvious.  Japanese Environmental Minister Horie Masahiko or &quot;MAC&quot; as he was known at \'Camp Nore\', sent a \'touch base\' email to Tony Podesta 50 years after they first met as part of the  People to People Student Ambassador Program&quot;, where influential young students (read:  CIA recruits) met with influential young students from Japan.  \'Mac\' sent this email just one week before Dennis Hastert was officially charged by the FBI in the last week of May 2015.  The timing was assuredly NOT coincidental.  
</p>
<p>Let\'s read the initial email and we\'ll take it from there:  
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/12354">https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/12354</a>  
</p>
<p>*This email was sent on 05/20/2015.  In it, Masahiko claims to have met with John Podesta at a UN dinner, where he was reminded of the \'good old days\' of their time at &quot;Camp Nose&quot;.  This will seem innocuous for now, but it will make much more sense as we continue.  Notice how Masahiko covers his tracks by purposely sending the email in &quot;foreign english&quot; so that it could not be used against him.  First of all the subject of the email is &quot;Hellow!&quot;  You have to be kidding me if you think a Japanese diplomat would send an email with the preferred greeting of a nation misspelled like that.  That would be like John Kerry sending an email to Xi Jinping the Prime Minister of China saying &quot;Nee-How&quot;, when the English Version of the Chinese Greeting is &quot;Ni Hao&quot;.  I will go so far as to say that he purposely spelled Hello &quot;HELLow&quot; so he could emphasize the word &quot;Hell&quot; as it pertains to the pedophilia subject matter.  He was playing them for the fool!  As if that was not enough, he opens the email with a question mark in front of the first sentence:  &quot;?Dear Tony,&quot;.  Again, a purposeful mistake that is so out of character for the meticulous nature of the Japanese people.  He put the question mark in front of the greeting to let Tony know that he has been looking into him.  
</p>
<p>The plot thickens as we start to see the responses:</p>
<p>Tony Podesta then sends an immediate email to John, that doesn\'t show any concern or love for Masahiko:</p>
<p>John Podesta:  &quot;Remember Him?&quot;  (John says &quot;Remember Him?&quot; as if to say he is a ghost of the past, and brush him off.)
<a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55883">https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55883</a></p>
<p>Tony Podesta then Replies:  &quot;Yes.  Dolan Hastert Han Ettelt Judy&quot;  (What he means is:  Yes, I know this is where I met all of these future power players.  Remember.&quot;)
<a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55132">https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55132</a>   
</p>
<p>Tony Podesta then replies to Masahiko nearly two weeks later AFTER Dennis Hastert has been officially charged by the FBI, and he refers to Hastert as &quot;Denny&quot;, as if &quot;Denny&quot; is somehow innocent of all the charges levied against him.  (Tony and John have been strategizing about this email night and day for the whole week)
<a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/48488">https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/48488</a></p>
<p>Masahiko then responds brilliantly, with a huge power play showing a photograph of him on the stage of the UN.  That is the ONLY picture attached, and it is meant to send a clear message to both of them:  He\'s in a position of power.  Notice again the purposely comical use of English to dissuade anyone from looking into his motives.  He begins with &quot;??Dear ?Tony,&quot;, this time using not one but three question marks.  He then goes on to show them his cards asserting the power that he has &quot;I hereto attach an article on Climate Change on the last page of which you can see my CV&quot;   Notice how the English here is flawless.  Also, again he is showing his prominence by sending his CV.  Two sentences later he covers his tracks again with another purposeful grammatical slip:  &quot;I will inform you next time I come to USA.&quot;  And then he ends the email with a demonstration of absolute power to show them how serious he is:  &quot;A photo of me in the UN General Assembly Hall on 20th May 2015 is attached hereto.&quot;  Notice anything?  The date of the photo is 05/20/2015, is the date when he first reached out to Tony Podesta. <br />

</p>
<p>Then Jan responds and we start to see the puzzle unravelling:</p>
<p>Jan doesn\'t respond until 06/02/2015 coincidentally one day after Tony Podesta responded, which leads me to believe that Jan and Tony rehearsed his response.  However, no matter how much Jan and Tony may have tried to control the situation we can see the cracks.</p>
<p>In the first paragraph Jan Estellt reveals that Masahiko spoke perfect English when the first met at Camp Nose:  &quot;You know, I clearly remember (like yesterday) when you recited a JFK speech (was it Japan Night or American Night?) at Nose. I remember that you held a JFK silver dollar in your hand while you recited. Brought tears to my eyes then. Good grief, wasn\'t it just a few years ago?&quot;  Jan is admitting that he heard Masahiko recite a speech of JFK that was so powerful it brought \'tears to his eyes\'.  It is nearly impossible for a speech given in another language to move someone to tears, so we must assume that Jan heard Masahiko\'s speech in English.  Knowing that, we have to conclude that Masahiko speaks fluent English, and the grammatical errors in the previous emails were purposefully crafted.  Shifting gears, it is important to note that Jan does not once mention the embarrassing charges levied against Dennis Hastert.  He also oddly tries to question the timing of the email saying:  &quot;[I am surprised to read you celebrated Nose anniversary last year because isn\'t 2015 actually the 50th anniversary? Perhaps we are counting differently. Not certain.]&quot;  Why would he be so concerned about the true date of the 50 year anniversary, unless he was prodding for answers as to the timing of the email.  
</p>
<p>BY THE WAY:  I am having a difficult time finding a digital footprint of Jan Estellt.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Is he some kind of ultra shadow government figure?</p>
<p>Masahiko then responds to Jan Estellt perfectly, playing him for the absolute fool, and claiming to have &quot;dementia stricken brains&quot;.  He knows Jan was talking to the Podestas and trying to prod him for information but he shuts that down by waxing comical (faked dialogue in CAPS):  &quot;Wow, wow, wow.  Jan, here you are now!!!  What a wonderful message from my beloved person in Nose.  Fabulous career and an ARTIST SON! I wish I could join one day one of his piano concerts.  Jan, Yes you are perfectly right in counting 50!  Thank you for telling me so and SORRY FOR MY DIMENTIA SICKEN BRAINS WHICH COUNT QUITE POORLY. Thank you also for the beautiful photo of you with Kei-chan and Dennis 50 years ago!  I will ask Kei-chan to send you the photos of us half a crentury ago.  Mac&quot;  &lt;----------- Masahiko thanks them for the photo of Dennis without ever mentioning the charges levied against &quot;Denny&quot;.  There is no way in hell this email chain could have taken place without explicitly addressing the charges against Dennis Hastert.  Once again, Masahiko is playing them for the fool.</p>
<p>HERE IS WHERE IT REALLY GETS INTERESTING.......</p>
<p>Then John Podesta starts to speak in plain English.  He knows that Masahiko KNOWS.  No need to elaborate.  Just see the quote:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/17065">https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/17065</a>
&quot;This traffic is really warm and REALLY WEIRD in light of HASTERT. Boy that\'s sad.&quot;</p>
<p>**Yep John, Masahiko knows what you and Tony are all about, and he\'s telling you via a random &quot;blast from the past.&quot;</p>
<p>Tony Podesta is starting to get nervous.  He emails John saying the following:  
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3664">https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3664</a>
&quot;I\'m still in shock When are you next going to japan? Holler when you get a free minute or two Tony&quot;.  Tony is in shock because he knows Masahiko knows.  He\'s asking when John is going to Japan next so he can get an idea when they can shut this down.  He asks him to &quot;holler when he gets a free minute or two&quot; because he needs to discuss some strategies off the books.&quot;<br />

             WOW!!  Thank you for this!  This proves my whole thesis.  There is no way in heck that he sent that email with those grammatical inconsistencies on accident.  He did it deliberately to mask his intent in sending the emails.

            Notice that the extra question marks aren't included in the top-posted version of the original message (in reply message).  I think the question mark might replace a non-ASCII character when the email was archived. This is not to take anything away from your excellent analysis.

            After Hastert was busted, the Republicans didn't want to investigate it, obviously, and they just wanted the scandal to go away and not drag it out figuring the Democrats would beat them over the head with it all through the election year, but strangely, and so unlike the Democrats, THAT NEVER HAPPENED.
           </p>
           <p>
            So there was never a deep investigation into how a seriously compromised child molester could be the 2nd most powerful person in the US for so many years and we're supposed to believe that Hastert only became blackmailable AFTER he was not in power anymore?
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump needs to call for an investigation into this. Democrats can't object because it is Republican investigating the details around another Republican. They'll have to applaud Trump for non-partisanship, initially.

            What they said was "that's sad".  "I'm still in shock" seems to refer to Hastert being charged.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a leap to say that they are trying to shut something down.  It might be more that this guy is trying to gain something thru Hasterts demise, what that might be is elusive.
           </p>
           <p>
            "This traffic is really warm and REALLY WEIRD in light of HASTERT".  I find the word "warm" to be strange.  Why would they characterize it that way?

              I saw on 4chan last night (don't even know how I got there) that the other unknown that Hastert paid is probably a famous person whom they are protecting.  They are all slime balls. Tony and Hastert went to Nose, Osake moons ago 50 yrs.  You should read a story in Chicago Mag. in 2013.  The story was an interview of Tony about their life and start in Chicago and
he speaks about Hastert and gives him a glowing report!  I would provide link but am just starting on here and am not too good at it yet.

             not seeing a sign of trafficking per se in the referenced email exchange. Do see concern over "mac" signalling knowledge of past involvement with hastert and potential scandal/exploit.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, did podesta(s) go to japan in 2015-16? Any $$ flowing related? Further communication by other means?
            </p>
            <p>
             identifying the email  as  "traffic" and saying "warm" is a far cry from saying, "what a nice heart-warming letter our old friend wrote, brother," and reluctance to  write further but switch communication channels underscores the suspicion.

            But Masahiko didn't reveal anything.
Let's hope Podesta will be charged and jailed, and all of his complices will be too.

             He didn't, but only because he was likely afraid to reveal anything because of the power of the Podestas.  He was sending them a message letting them know he was on to them and that they better not have any designs on Japan.  In my personal opinion.  I think we will hear from "Mac" a lot in 2017.
