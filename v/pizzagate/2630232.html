            So far, it still remains true that Clinton had no idea who Silsby was, Bill Clinton did not intervene and the Connection to Alefantis through Max Maccoby also remains false.

            This is obvious dis information, all evidence points to direct state Department intervention at the highest level. We couldn’t even get state Department intervention for the detention of Laura Ling in DPRK at the same time. And she was taken from the Chinese side of the border into NK.

             Yeah our embassy in North Korea, really dropped the ball on this one.  Didn't they.  Wait, what's that we have no embassy in North Korea!  That seems pretty big.
And Lisa Ling, can you tell us why we have no embassy in North Korea?
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Ms. LISA LING: The U.S. and North Korea have no diplomatic relationship. So they only communicate through a third-party country in Sweden, or through the six-party talks or from a humanitarian mission that they have in New York. But other than that, communication is next to zero.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             So Lisa Ling even if we had no diplomatic relations with North Korea did you get any help from the State Department?
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Ms. LISA LING: Well, from the get go, Vice President Gore and members from the State Department who had been advising us had strongly suggested that we keep things very, very quiet. And that was very understandable because we didn't know exactly what happened to Laura and Euna.
             </p>
             <p>
              So we were also fearing that the North Koreans might do something drastic. I mean, this is a highly, highly unpredictable regime. The story that Laura and Euna were covering was a very, very sensitive one. So before knowing anything, we just thought we should maintain silence.
             </p>
             <p>
              But I just started to reach out to as many contacts as I could, and one of the people who is most closely associated with U.S.-North Korea relations, is Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson. He, of all American - of any American -has had the most successes in negotiating the releases of previous American detainees in North Korea. So he was a natural, sort of, connection to make.
             </p>
             <p>
              And he was incredibly helpful from the start, and told me that he would start making contacts with the State Department and his contacts in North Korea. And a couple of days into our conversations, he was actually approached by President Obama and Secretary Clinton, and asked to actually help on our behalf.
             </p>

             <p>
              "It would be highly unusual for the secretary of state to intervene in a case involving the judicial process of another country," spokesman P.J. Crowley said in an off-camera question-and-answer session.
"We have had regular consular access and meetings with the 10 American citizens," Crowley said. "I believe we have facilitated getting medicine or other needs to our citizens. We are doing exactly what we would do with detained Americans anywhere in the world.
             </p>

             <strong>
              The situation in North Korea and the situation in Haiti are dramatically different. In Haiti there is a functioning government with which we have diplomatic relations and established channels to monitor and deal with bilateral issues.

             North Korea is an opaque society with which we have no diplomatic relations."

             Two days ago the Pizzagate Wiki experienced an unprecedented DDoS attack for several continuous hours. At the exact same time the Wiki was experiencing a massive surge in users being directed from a Reddit post on convicted child trafficker Laura Silsby. This makes the fourth major cyberattack against the Pizzagate Wiki following attacks on the original Pizzagate Review, the Wiki's DynCorp page and the Wiki's Stratfor page.
In addition to these new users, a huge wave of bots came with them and proceeded to overwhelm the Pizzagate Wiki server, starting with the curiously named, "mj12bot".
Apparently mj12bot is part of a United Kingdom search engine founded by Alex Chudnovsky whose mission for MJ12 is this:
Since the task of building a World Wide Web search engine is so huge, we have chosen to make Majestic-12 Distributed Search Engine based on the concept of distributed computing. The idea being that many machines work on one task to get it done quicker than one large machine alone.
Apparently this "distributed search engine" felt the need to assault my Franklin Scandal, Max Maccoby, Laura Silsby and other pages with thousands upon thousands of 0-byte requests from different IPs. MJ12bot was easy to spot, however, as it was listed and visible in the visitor's "User Agent", and was quickly blocked.
In a matter of seconds, however, new bots arrived. Almost a hundred different "ocarinabots", "FAKE USER AGENTS" and various other bizarre User Agents were assaulting the Pizzagate Wiki with similar, 0-byte requests.
Curiously enough, for many hours the only users able to connect to the Pizzagate Wiki were from Georgetown, FL.
After playing virtual chess with a literal army of robots, I was able to stop the attacks for the time being and users from the Reddit thread were able to see the relevant information they needed for the most part.
Why, however, was the link between Laura Silsby and Max Maccoby targeted this time around? For posterity, here is what is written in Max Maccoby's section for the Pizzagate Wiki on Laura Silsby's page, which was the epicenter of the attack:
Connection to Max Maccoby and James Achilles Alefantis
James Achilles Alefantis is friends with Michael Maccoby. Michael's son, Max Maccoby, is a Director of Friends of the Orphans, the charity Laura Silsby was given children from while in Haiti.(22), (23) , (24)
This same Max Maccoby also represented James Achilles Alefantis and David Brock for an $850,000 blackmail case.(25)
More details and in-depth analysis on the attack will be published in this week's Rebel Outpost, but I thought it worth mentioning here in case it were to escalate further and actually damage the Pizzagate Wiki. It is unlike any attack I have ever seen in my life, but is clearly from an advanced botnet."

              Cool story.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, there is no connection between Maccoby and Silsby.  This part is false
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               is a Director of Friends of the Orphans, the charity Laura Silsby was given children from while in Haiti
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              We know exactly where Silsby got the children from. The AP went and spoke to all the parents
              <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-ap-finds-all-baptist-groups-orphans-had-parents-2010feb21-story.html">
               http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-ap-finds-all-baptist-groups-orphans-had-parents-2010feb21-story.html
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              So the Alefanti-Maccoby-Silsby connection is also false.  It's based on a claim by the liar, conman, fake laywer and at-the-time child trafficking fugitive Jorge Puello who we know was lying about all sorts of things during this time.  But when you go and look at what actually happened there's no way what he is saying could be true.  Again we know EXACTLY where the children came from and we know EXACTLY where the Maccoby orphanage was located.  They aren't even in the same towns.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               A reporter's visit Saturday to the rubble-strewn Citron slum, where 13 of the children lived, led to their parents, all of whom said they turned their youngsters over to the missionary group voluntarily in hopes of getting them to safety.
              </p>
              <p>
               Similar explanations were given by parents in the mountain town of Callabas, outside Port-au-Prince, who told the AP on Feb. 3 that desperation and blind faith led them to hand over 20 children to the Baptist group.

             Who "CA" stands for is not clear. "HHS" presumably means the Department of Health and Human Services. "Amcits" is American citizens.

             Why Hillary Clinton did not violate State Department Policy
            </h1>
            <p>
             The reason she didn't violate State Department policy is Bill Clinton was not used as a negotiator.  (Also I would guess something like that would be a president's decision not just a Secretary of State's, but I don't know.)
            </p>
            <p>
             The article includes support for its claim including this link:
then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took extraordinary measures, including the deployment of former president Bill Clinton as a negotiator

             This a reprint of an article I mention in my VOAT threads and in comments here.  It's from the UK Times

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              A DIPLOMATIC deal over the 10 American missionaries jailed in Haiti on child abduction charges may lead to the release this week of all except the group's leader, Laura Silsby, according to legal sources in Port-au-Prince
             </p>
             <p>
              The intervention of Bill Clinton, the former president, who is co-ordinating relief efforts in Haiti, may accelerate the resolution of an affair that has embarrassed the US government, dismayed relief agencies and angered many Haitians.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Here's the thing with the article.  It's the only news outlet in the world that made this claim.  And it never made the claim again.  It dropped the claim a week later when talking about Bill Clinton.  I think they simply reported a rumor that their source heard and that rumor turned out to be true.  The rumor being based on few things.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bill Clinton turned up in Haiti....(He was actually working with the UN.  He had been the Special Envoy to Haiti since 2009 and after the earthquake the UN asked him "to assume a leadership role in coordinating international aid efforts."
            </p>
            <p>
             Most of the Baptists were about to get out of jail.....but not Silsby.  This is because the Haitian authorities felt that Silsby was clearly behind all these and the other Baptists pretty much followed along when she said she had things taken care of.
            </p>
            <p>
             The original news report is wrong and here's why I believe that.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's based on a single report in the UK press
             <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/clinton-brokers-deal-over-haiti-orphan-abductions-v63ld395r7b">
              https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/clinton-brokers-deal-over-haiti-orphan-abductions-v63ld395r7b
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             No other news reports have this. The UK press didn't claim this is a secret effort on behalf of Bill Clinton. An actual diplomatic intervention would have been reported by multiple sites if it actually happened. Haitian newspapers would have been all over this. The international press would be all over this.
            </p>
            <p>
             The paper that reported it never followed up on it at all. So the original report had no confirmation and zero follow through.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Clinton quotes they used were reported by other outlets 2 days before. Clinton openly spoke to reporters about what the US and Haitian governments should do. He never claimed anything first hand or that he was working on a deal and not a single other source claimed he was intervening in any way. In fact, in CNN's report on it, Bill Clinton doesn't even appear until 22 paragraphs in.
             <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/02/05/haiti.arrests/index.html">
              http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/02/05/haiti.arrests/index.html
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             There was no press conference about having a reached a deal. Again this was not reported to be a secret deal.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bill Clinton left Haiti with all the Baptists were in jail.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Obama adminstration and the State Department were being criticized in the conservative press and by Baptist leaders FOR NOT INTERVENING.
             <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/feb/08/free-the-baptist-10-in-haiti/">
              https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/feb/08/free-the-baptist-10-in-haiti/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Even with this the State Department went out of its way to say it was not intervening and Secretary Clinton would not be getting involved at all.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the time, no other media even did a story following up on the The Times's report. This happens all the time when papers confirm another a paper's reporting. They do not do a followup story when their sources cannot confirm this. And reporters from around the world were on this story for months.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nothing in the 7 plus years since the Haitian earthquake suggests this was true and the Clintons, of course came under intense scrutiny during this time. Haiti's AP reporter who worked this story stayed in Haiti for years writing a book and never had anything on this.
            </p>
            <p>
             In short, there's nothing at all to suggest the Times got their story right. And there's a lot to suggest they got their story wrong, including the fact that they never even followed up on their story. The writer of the Paper relied on them and did not do original research/reporting into this.

            I think it's safe to say that both of the Clintons
            <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN05143144._CH_.2400">
             knew who Laura Silsby was.
            </a>
            I also think it's safe to say that Silsby
            <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children%27s_Refuge_case#Timeline_of_events}">
             knew what she was doing was wrong.
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            There's a docu-series on Netflix called The Traffickers, where an investigative journalist tries to get to the root of certain international trafficking industries. One of those is child trafficking in international adoption. The Silsby case seems parallel to some of the things touched on in that particular episode. Many of the kids weren't actually orphans, and their parents had been told they would see their children again. Many parents in these situations are desperate for their children to have better opportunities. Someone comes by and says they can get their child to America (a paradise, to them) and get them a better education, etc. and these parents think they are doing their children a favor, and that they will see their child again in a few years. They're not being told they're giving up their rights to their child permanently.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think Silsby was looking to make a quick buck by taking advantage of poor Haitians. Whether or not the Clintons were involved in this, I'm unsure of. I don't know that there's anything proving they were in cahoots with Silsby prior to her going to Haiti. I also don't know if Bill Clinton really interfered on Silsby's behalf, or if her lowered charges were decided upon by the Haitian government. I do believe that the Clintons wanted to make money off of the earthquake, but I don't know that their plans involved Silsby.

             The pizzagate claim is that Clintons knew who Laura Silsby was BEFORE she was arrested and became one of the biggest news stories on the planet. The argument is Clinton only became involved because she was personally involved with Silsby.   I have shown this is false.

              I agree with you on the idea that there is no real proof to show that the Clintons knew Silsby prior to her going to Haiti. The Wikileaks emails released as "proof" appeared to me to have taken place after the fact, not before. The State Department knows when US citizens are arrested abroad, so it's obvious Hillary to have been alerted to this as she was Secretary of State at the time.

              You are correct, none of the children were orphans. I wasn't sure of the exact number when I first commented, but I knew that at least most of them did in fact have parents. It's sad to think of how many parents were taken advantage of when they were simply so desperate to give their children better lives.
             </p>
             <p>
              I also agree that there is no evidence that Bill Clinton intervened on her behalf. The original source that I saw for this was a paper in a Harvard Human rights journal entitled  "Owning Laura Silsby's Shame". The author of this paper came to the conclusion that Clinton had intervened, which was of course jumped on by people on Reddit/Voat, but I never was able to trace that claim back to a reliable source. I attempted to contact the author of the paper to clarify but never received a response. On the other hand, we don't know
              <em>
               for a fact
              </em>
              that Clinton DIDN'T interfere; he was in Haiti at the time, and he was vocal about not agreeing with the Haitian government holding the "missionaries" in jail. I think confirmation bias can play a part on either side of this scenario.

               The footnote in that paper cites the same UK Times article I reference.  So it's the same single source.

              You love Jews you dumb cunt.  Even said you were glad you didn't believe me about them because you let one babysit your kids or some shit.  Keep believing in a Savior like Trump/Q and proving that women are too naive to be allowed any decisions.  We are SO CLOSE to taking your "rights" away. =)

            Here's previous threads I did on this.     If you are trying to prove me wrong.   Go to the original sources and do not use Pleadding the YIFF or Williams Craddick's posts as evidence as I shows that his claim is false and I use the original sources to show that he must have known his claims were false.

             I’m not trying to prove you wrong. I just know you are extremely biased and a shill. You seem to always have an excuse for these sick fucks. What is your opinion of Hillary??
