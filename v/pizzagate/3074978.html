<p>While targeting vaccine safety advocates and documentation revealing flaws and corruption in the vaccine industry, Schiff\'s request for censorship COULD BE APPLIED TO ANY TOPIC. Here is the current outcome:</p>
<p>&quot;Schiff’s letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos follows two others letters Schiff sent to Google head Sundar Pichai and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg. In all three, Schiff criticized the platforms for serving up anti-vaccine propaganda where people look for information about vaccines. He also criticized Amazon for accepting paid advertising for anti-vaccine media. “Every online platform, including Amazon, must act responsibly and ensure that they do not contribute to this growing public-health catastrophe,” Schiff wrote.&quot; <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2019/03/adam-schiff-asks-amazon-to-censor-books-about-vaccination.html#comments">https://www.ageofautism.com/2019/03/adam-schiff-asks-amazon-to-censor-books-about-vaccination.html#comments</a></p>
<p>The result?
&quot;Censorship is Here. Vaxxed, Removed from Amazon Prime Streaming, Ranked #1 in Category&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Vaxxed has been removed from Amazon\'s Prime streaming service. The DVD remains available and is ranked Number 1 in the entire category, even beating out... Mr. Rogers and RBG. See screen photos below.  American business is now fully embracing censorship of the vaccine safety topic.&quot;  <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2019/03/censorship-is-here-vaxxed-removed-from-amazon-prime-streaming-ranked-1-in-category.html">https://www.ageofautism.com/2019/03/censorship-is-here-vaxxed-removed-from-amazon-prime-streaming-ranked-1-in-category.html</a></p>
<p>FYI- Vaxxed was released a few years ago and is a documentary about vaccine whistle blower Dr. William Thompson, Senior Scientist, Vaccine Safety, CDC. He revealed practicing scientific fraud in completing a vaccine safety case study looking for a relationship between giving the MMR vaccine on schedule vs. delayed and the outcome of autism. The data did show a significant link. The protocol was changed to achieve a favorable outcome instead. His sworn statement and documenting evidence was turned over to Congressman Bill Posey. Posey reads Thompson\'s statement into the Congressional Record: <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4546421/rep-bill-posey-calling-investigation-cdcs-mmr-reasearch-fraud">https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4546421/rep-bill-posey-calling-investigation-cdcs-mmr-reasearch-fraud</a></p>

            I think this is important news, but I'm not sure how its related directly to pizzagate. Sure, it's elite cover-up but I don't see the direct tie to pedophilia.

             https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/health-news/anti-vaxx-moms-gets-fake-news-from-facebook-teen-tells-congress/ar-BBUp7Rw?li=BBnb7Kz&amp;ocid=U346DHP

           </p>
           <p>
            A teenager who made headlines after defying his anti-vaxx mother testified in front of Congress on Tuesday, saying his mother's misinformation stemmed from social media.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ethan Lindenberger, a teenager from of Norwalk, Ohio, traveled to Washington, D.C., to speak at a health, education, labor and pension committee hearing Tuesday on a panel alongside health experts including John Wiesman, Washington state's Secretary of Health.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lindenberger said as he approached high school and questioned why he wasn't vaccinated, his mother often met him with misinformation she found online and in social media groups — never trusting health officials. He recalled showing his mother articles from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and her replying with skepticism.
           </p>
           <p>
            "That’s what they want you to think," she would tell him, Lindenberger said Tuesday.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a question-and-answer portion of the hearing, Lindenberger named Facebook as one of the sites his mother used often to wrongly suggest vaccines could cause harm. He also said she has posted videos with fake news on the site.
           </p>
           <p>
            This isn't the first time Facebook has been accused of being a platform for fake health news. Responding to backlash last month, Facebook said  it has "taken steps" to reduce misinformation around anti-vaxx posts.
           </p>
           <p>
            After his thread went viral, he told "Good Morning America" he never received vaccines for hepatitis, polio, measles, mumps, rubella or chickenpox. In December of last year, he caught up on his missed immunizations.
           </p>
           <p>
            People choosing not to vaccinate have become a global health threat in 2019, the World Health Organization reported. The CDC recognized that the number of children who aren't being vaccinated by 24 months old has been gradually increasing.
           </p>
           <p>
            This week, another study showed the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) does not increase the risk of autism and does not trigger autism in children who are at risk. This research adds to already available studies saying the same.
           </p>

             <p>
              The study strongly supports that MMR vaccination does not increase the risk for autism, does not trigger autism in susceptible children, and is not associated with clustering of autism cases after vaccination. It adds to previous studies through significant additional statistical power and by addressing hypotheses of susceptible subgroups and clustering of cases.

            </h2>
            <p>
             The MMR Vaccine causes autism idea. was the result of a single paper in the British Medical Journal, The Lancet.  It really didn't exist before that.  That paper is now found to be fraudulent.  The paper studied only 12 subjects.  It had one main author and 10 co-authors. However, no subsequent study could reproduce the results and soon the main co-authors took their names off the paper.   Years later the main author, Andrew Wakefield by the  General Medical Council and they declared his paper was fraudulent and he was declared unfit to practice medicine in the UK.
            </p>
            <p>
             Among his sins were falsely adjusting the data on all 12 subjects to make it look vaccines were the, ignoring that most of the kids in the study were having behavior problems BEFORE they were vaccinated, not disclosing he was being paid by lawyers who intended to sue the vaccine makers and

             <p>
              Only 1 of 9 kids said to have regressive autism clearly had it. Three had no form of autism.
             </p>
             <p>
              Contrary to the paper's assertion that all the kids were normal before vaccination, five had some sort of preexisting developmental problems.
             </p>
             <p>
              Behavioral problems the paper said popped up days after vaccination didn't actually appear for months in some kids, a fact that undercuts the causality of vaccination.

              BEWARE THE DANISH STUDIES:
             </p>
             <p>
              "There were no thimerosal-containing vaccines in the Danish program during the study period. The specific MMR vaccine used in the study period contained the following vaccine strains: Schwarz (measles, 2000 to 2007) or Ender's Edmonton (measles, 2008–2013), Jeryl Lynn (mumps), and Wistar RA 27/3 (rubella)."
             </p>
             <p>
              THIS IS NOT COMPARABLE TO THE U.S. SCHEDULE. No "thimerosal-containing vaccines."  Mercury in vaccines has also been suspected to be linked with autism. HepB has 25mg mercury. Flu vaccines contain mercury. Some have hypothesized that the vaccine adjuvants + other vaccines in schedule as a whole, can trigger autism.
             </p>
             <p>
              According to CDC whistleblower Dr. William Thompson:  "But there is this dream data set....I can say, I do think that thimerosal causes tics. I can say, tics are four times more prevalent in autism. There is a biological, there is a biologic plausibility right now I really do believe there is, to say that thimerosal causes autism-like symptoms."

              "FUGITIVE CDC Researcher Tops Federal “MOST WANTED” List"
             </p>
             <p>
              "WASHINGTON, DC – The Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General has moved Danish Researcher Poul Thorsen to the top of their “Most Wanted OIG Fugitives” list. Thorsen was a top CDC investigator on autism.
             </p>
             <p>
              “Any research linked to a person indicted for felony criminal activities should be suspect,” stated Eric Uram, SafeMinds Executive Director. “If Thorsen is capable of the crimes listed in this indictment, he is easily capable of falsifying research results. If he is found guilty, CDC should disavow Thorsen’s research and revisit any policy determinations where it was used.”
             </p>
             <p>
              The U.S. Government indicted Thorsen on April 13, 2011 on 22 counts of wire fraud and money laundering, including the embezzlement of over $1 million of CDC grant money between 2004 and 2010. Funds were given to Thorsen to study links between autism, mercury and vaccines, along with several other developmental disorders. The Office of Inspector General for the US Department of Health and Human Services reported Thorsen remains free, but it seeks his extradition from Denmark.
             </p>
             <p>
              Astonishingly, the CDC has continued to collaborate with Thorsen since his indictment. As recently as this month, over a year later, Thorsen is still listed as a co-author on research with a CDC employee. “The allegation Thorsen stole money intended for research and claimed full-time employment at two universities at the same time brings everything he has done into question,” said Rebecca Estepp, EBCALA Media Director.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thorsen was a co-author on one of the five studies used to show no link between autism, mercury and vaccines (Madsen et al. 2003) and was actively involved in the grant funding for two other key studies (Stehr-Green et al. 2003, Hviid et al. 2003). The Institute of Medicine used these studies to justify its 2004 conclusion that no further research was needed on mercury preservatives, vaccines and autism."

               "Poul Thorsen, MD PhD, headed up a research unit at Aarhus University that was hired by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prepare a series of studies that would exonerate thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative and adjuvant used in vaccines, and the MMR vaccine from any role in causing autism. The veracity of the two studies he co-authored is now in doubt.
              </p>
              <p>
               These studies formed the foundation for the conclusions of several Institute of Medicine reports that claimed that it was highly unlikely that thimerosal or MMR were implicated in autism.
              </p>
              <p>
               In a statement Aarhus University officials said that believe Thorsen forged documents supposedly from the CDC to obtain the release of $2 million from the University. Thorsen resigned abruptly in March 2009 and left Denmark. Since then Thorsen has held several jobs in the US, first at Emory University in Atlanta and then at Drexel University in Philadelphia. Documents show that as late as January 22, 2009. Thorsen was employed at Drexel. Any reference to Poulsen has now been deleted from the Drexel website.
              </p>
              <p>
               Investigations also revealed that while employed full-time for the University of Aarhus in Denmark, Thorsen simultaneously held a fulltime position at Emory University in Atlanta, and drew salaries from both Universities despite a contract with Aarhus forbidding outside employment. According to the statement from Aarhus University.
              </p>
              <p>
               Autism advocacy groups have published extensive analyses on Thorsen's studies and found many problems in methods, assumptions and conclusions that are supported by the data. And Thorsen is the lynchpin in the series of studies used to dismiss concerns about thimerosal and MMR causing autism.

              Merck Recalls 1 Million Doses of Children's Vaccines
             </p>
             <p>
              "Merck has begun a voluntary recall of certain lots of Pedvaxhib, its Heamophilus influenzae Type B (Hib) vaccine, and Comvax, its combination Hib-hepatitis B vaccine.
             </p>
             <p>
              None of the doses has been found to be contaminated, and children who received the vaccine are not THOUGHT to be at risk, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Julie GERBERDING said."  (This director was CDC whistleblower Dr. William Thompson's boss during the time he and his team committed scientific fraud to coverup data showing a relationship of MMR vaccine given on time and increased risk of autism. A few years later, she was hired by Merck (makers of MMR vaccine) to head their global vaccine division.)
             </p>
             <p>
              "During routine testing of a Pennsylvania facility, Merck identified a manufacturing issue that could have allowed microorganisms to survive a sterilization process"
             </p>
             <p>
              The recall will affect the CDC’s stockpile of Hib vaccines, which includes Merck-manufactured vaccines. The CDC will use its stockpile to help fill the gap left by the recalled doses."

              AWS...where is the CDC follow-up study on the children who received those vaccines? They can trace them through the vaccine lot number.

              And what about that TIRED, WORN OUT JERRYL LYNN in the mumps vaccine?
             </p>
             <p>
              "Mumps: Jeryl Lynn Story"
"Maurice Hilleman discusses harvesting mumps virus in 1963 from his ill daughter, Jeryl Lynn. He attenuated the virus and used it to develop the mumps vaccine in wide use today."

              </a>
              Daddy Hilleman was NOT worried about daughter Jeryl Lynn having the mumps. He was worried he would have to postpone his business out of the country! He left her with a nurse and went on his way.....
             </p>
             <p>
              LOOK AT JERYL LYNN NOW!

              "Those relators, Stephen Krahling and Joan Wlochowski, were Merck virologists who claim in their unsealed complaint that they “witnessed firsthand the improper testing and data falsification in which Merck engaged to artificially inflate the vaccine’s efficacy findings.”
     Krahling and Wlochowski claimed Merck’s scheme caused the United States to pay “hundreds of millions of dollars for a vaccine that does not provide adequate immunization.”
     “As the largest single purchaser of childhood vaccines (accounting for more than 50 percent of all vaccine purchases), the United States is by far the largest financial victim of Merck’s fraud,” according to the 2010 False Claims Act complaint. “But the ultimate victims here are the millions of children who every year are being injected with a mumps vaccine that is not providing them with an adequate level of protection. And while this is a disease that, according to the Centers for Disease Control (‘CDC’), was supposed to be eradicated by now, the failure in Merck’s vaccine has allowed this disease to linger, with significant outbreaks continuing to occur.”"
             </p>
             <p>
              " Merck is the only manufacturer licensed by the FDA to sell the mumps vaccine in United States, and if it could not show that the vaccine was 95 percent effective, it risked losing its lucrative monopoly, according to the complaint.
     That’s why Merck found it critically important to keep claiming such a high efficacy rate, the complaint states.
     And, Chatom claims, that’s why Merck went to great lengths, including “manipulating its test procedures and falsifying the test results,” to prop up the bogus figure, though it knew that the attenuated virus from which it created the vaccine had been altered over the years during the manufacturing process, and that the quality of the vaccine had degraded as a result."

              "Three years after the largest and most serious shortage of childhood vaccines in 20 years, the federal stockpile of childhood vaccines — designed as a buffer against future shortages — is nearly empty and without immediate prospects of being filled.
             </p>
             <p>
              Three of the four companies that produce the shots recommended for every child told the government last year they would not sell their products for the little-known but important piece of the nation’s public-health infrastructure."
             </p>
             <p>
              "No one has accused vaccine manufacturers of wrongdoing. However, they no longer can treat as revenue the money they receive when they sell millions of doses of vaccine into the stockpile because the shots are not delivered until the government calls for them in emergencies."
             </p>
             <p>
              "The situation came to a head late last summer when CDC asked the vaccine makers to make new sales to the stockpile. Sanofi Pasteur (formerly Aventis Pasteur), Wyeth and GlaxoSmithKline said no. Only Merck said yes."

              MORE DANISH FRAUD RESEARCH?
             </p>
             <p>
              James Lyons-Weiler on the New MMR/Autism Study From Denmark
             </p>
             <p>
              "(1) The smoking gun is the study-wide autism rate of 0.9-1%.  The rate of ASD in Denmark is 1.65%.  Where are the missing cases of ASD?  Given past allegations of this group’s malfeasance and fraud, the rest of the study cannot be accepted based on this disparity alone: the study group is not representative of the population being studied...."
             </p>
             <p>
              From a comment:
"Indeed, I agree with James that there are likely missing cases, and over at RI I am pointing out how exactly it happened. For starters, this study is just a follow-up of the previous Danish study, Madison et al 2002. That study utilized a birth cohort of all Danish kids born from Jan 1990 to Dec 1998. The obvious problem with that study was the quick cut-off date, the date that the study ended and the researchers stopped counting times to a diagnosis. Two prominent critics had this to say,,,,,
             </p>
             <p>
              Goldman and Yazbak, in a letter published in the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, pointed out the “substantial under-representation of autism diagnoses and vaccination status for children born in the later study years.[5]” Children with ASD in Denmark are diagnosed at about 5 years old; many were simply too young to receive an ASD diagnosis by the end of the study period. This would apply to all children under the age of 36 months and, in a practical sense, to many of the 3-5 year olds. Among children born in 1997 and 1998, who made up a substantial proportion (39%) of the total years of observation time, many had yet to even receive an MMR vaccine all.
             </p>
             <p>
              WHAT THE COCHRANE REVIEW SAID:
             </p>
             <p>
              ■ Follow up on medical records terminated just one year after the last day of admission to the cohort. “Because of the length of time from birth to diagnosis, the Cochrane reviewers felt it became ’… increasingly unlikely that those born later in the cohort could have a diagnosis.”
             </p>

               https://www.ageofautism.com/2011/05/vaccines-and-autism-what-do-epidemiological-studies-really-tell-us.html
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              With this current study there appears to be a slight improvement in the time lag between the last birth cohort (Dec 2009) and the study's cut-off date (Aug 2013), but the fact that mean age of diagnosis is now 7 as opposed to Madison's 5 makes things essentially a wash, and we have the same problem on our hands. Spelling things out, a child born in the last cohort will be less than 3 at the time of cut-off. In fact, roughly half of the kids in the total sample will not reach the age of 7 where they would have a mere 50% chance of being diagnosed. Does this not sound like a recipe for hordes of missed cases? It sure does!
             </p>
             <p>
              The truly head scratching thing is the Danish database is quite historic, and the researchers could've selected much older birth cohorts to study. Heck- they could've reexamined the Madison et al cases and while keeping the Aug 2013 cut-off. This would've ensured no missed cases with the kids having sufficient time to mature to a diagnosis. They did not do this opting instead to repeat the same mistake that was leveled against Madison et al. Deliberate? You bet your bottom dollar it was! A quick cut-off date is the most efficient way of getting rid of cases outside of blatant manipulation or fraud.

For starters, this study is just a follow-up of the previous Danish study, Madison et al 2002. That study utilized a birth cohort of all Danish kids born from Jan 1990 to Dec 1998. The obvious problem with that study was the quick cut-off date, the date that the study ended and the researchers stopped counting times to a diagnosis. Two prominent critics had this to say,,,,,

              Goldman and Yazbak, in a letter published in the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, pointed out the “substantial under-representation of autism diagnoses and vaccination status for children born in the later study years.[5]” Children with ASD in Denmark are diagnosed at about 5 years old; many were simply too young to receive an ASD diagnosis by the end of the study period. This would apply to all children under the age of 36 months and, in a practical sense, to many of the 3-5 year olds. Among children born in 1997 and 1998, who made up a substantial proportion (39%) of the total years of observation time, many had yet to even receive an MMR vaccine all.

              WHAT THE COCHRANE REVIEW SAID:

             <p>
              ■ Follow up on medical records terminated just one year after the last day of admission to the cohort. “Because of the length of time from birth to diagnosis, the Cochrane reviewers felt it became ’… increasingly unlikely that those born later in the cohort could have a diagnosis.”

              THE LIE HEARD ROUND THE WORLD
Top vaccine scientist for government lies under oath and says measles vaccine does NOT cause encephalitis / encephalopathy. (Hannah Poling won a $1.5 million settlement in vaccine court for vaccine induced encephalopathy which some believe contributed to a diagnoses of AUTISM.)
Also lists MILLIONS spent by Big Pharma on Commerce Committee members on the panel at the committee hearing.

             <p>
              Federal Court Compensated 83 Vaccine-Injured Autistic Children:
"The catalyst for this Pace law review of VICP published compensated cases, was the case of Hannah Poling.  In a 2008 report submitted to the VICP (which was leaked to the press) the Health and Human Services administration "conceded"  that vaccines had triggered Hannah Poling’s encephalopathy and subsequent developmental regression. HHS’s description of the child’s condition implied a distinction between “autism-­like symptoms” and “autism,” although there was no ambiguity that Hannah Poling in fact had autism.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 2010, the VICP court award Poling $1.5 million, while denying other similarly injured children compensation. Nevertheless, in March 3, 2011, HHS baldly disclaimed its own 2008 "concession" document, stating in its Statistics Report: “HHS has never concluded in any case that autism was caused by vaccination.”"
