             Home of the Franklin cover up? Do you have the address? :) :) hello There. I have hardly looked at the false flag. I've been looking at Omaha Nebraska today, so you kinda shocked me saying that about the Franklin. How is paddock connected?

            This is random , but I wonder how many people on PG sub verse are actually going to celebrate All Hallows' eve ..or Halloween ?

I hope some turn away from these pagan practices . Seems so innocent ...NOT

              Venezuela has 30 million Catholic starving, they are eating their pets and the zoo animals....the pope is only praying for them....my gosh he is satans best friend.  The Pope can't buy a boat and load it with food and take to thier shores! I have to remember to be angry and yet not sin. People don't realize that Devine teachings prevent observers from attacking wrong doers. The Pope is impotent not important. Just some of thier robs cost 3500.00 and that's probably for priests that buy off the racks at the holy ruud. Did you know that in old times it was the bishops that created the teachings in the Catholic Church and then the Pope would adopt them, it is like a Sanhedrin . Also, monks played a very important role in starting the Catholic Church and we all know how much they love the condemned high places. They have the highest in the world. Won't we have nice fires to warm our hands on in the high mountain places tearing those gross things down, that is if they make it. I'm sure they will make great crannies while we are there camping. Hehe, I know, I'm terrible, but I gotta vent a little. Yes, Warwick  was dedicated today and I'm in heaven that they are free of ny. Huge blessings ahead friend!

                For months, as Venezuela's economy has gone off the rails, the United Nations, U.S. and Latin American governments have called for President Nicolas Maduro to accept humanitarian aid to ease shortages that have helped spark a growing anti-government protest movement. The embattled socialist leader has refused, seeing foreign offers of help as a possible Trojan horse that could open the politically turbulent nation to foreign military intervention. The ban extends to the Roman Catholic Church's charity arm.

               <p>
                Caracas, Venezuela - A top Venezuelan prelate slammed President Nicolás Maduro’s lack of “moral authority” in calling for peace while preventing the Catholic Church and other institutions from relieving the country’s severe food crisis.
“The interests of the government are not the interests of the country,” said Archbishop Diego Padrón of Cumaná, who heads the Venezuelan Conference of Catholic Bishops.
The archbishop made his remarks during his opening speech at the Venezuelan Conference of Catholic Bishops’ recent plenary assembly.
Venezuela’s socialist government is widely blamed for the crisis. Since 2003, price controls on some 160 products, including cooking oil, soap, and flour, have meant that while they are affordable, they fly off store shelves only to be resold on the black market at much higher rates.
“The ungovernability, aside from the brutal repression, the lack of serious and stabilizing responses that would be more than improvisational and provisional, create the widespread perception that the global crisis is getting more acute and is being prolonged with no end in sight,” the archbishop said.

                Those are just words and words has never fed a hungry person. The vatican sits as a king in the whole world!!!!!! if they can get a red cross to the front  of the war, he can manuver something. im not buying it. Where has he been talking about getting food in immediately? Where is he talking with governments to help? Where is he pleading on tv? He is silent. and he organizes with governments to get things done. What IS he doing? I want to see action. He could at least have something to offer off the coast for the people. Where are his relief efforts? I know he is praying. actions speak louder than words. Where are his announcements to the world his plan of getting food there.? sorry, if those people were my children I would be waiting on the sea EVERYday. Do you think the world would take notice of that? You dont think he couldnt sneek people in there to find out how to help the people? Is he asking to see thier government weekly?  What would you do if they were you 30 million children counting on you? The Pope has power he just pretends he doesnt when he doesnt want to do anything.  People need food everyday! They cant afford to wait on politics like the Pope.

                 The Red Cross can operate on the front lines because the guys with guns have agreed that there should be some limits on warfare.  They agreed to this at the first Geneva Convention in 1864, a year after the Red Cross was founded.

                 The Kingdom of Italy was a literal enemy of The Pope, an on the battlefield enemy of the Pope.  During the Italian wars of Unification, King Victor Emmanuel II from Sardinia battled the nation known as the Papal States and annexed all of their territory except Rome and their way to becoming the  Kingdom of Italy.  Victor Emmanuel II became King of Italy.   French Troops remained in Rome guarding the Pope.  In 1870 when the Franco Prussian War broke out, these troops were called back to fight and The Kingdom of Italy declared war on the last remaining Papal State and drove the Pope into Vatican City where the pope was "prisoner." The Pope and his successors refused to leave the Vatican until 1929 when Italy and the Pope signed a treaty and the nation of Vatican City was established.

                  he sits AS a king...........the redcross comment.was a comparison, do you know the real reason red cross( the queen) was developed?&gt;&gt;  SEARCH bar red cross news from the front  304,000,000 results , yes they do good things, im not sying they dont, but they are the eye up front, and they made war decrees that says its a war crime to touch the red cross so they dont get t hier butts shot off because who would go to the front if they didnt put that war crime rule in place? &gt;&gt; Do you think the makers of war Care about limits and crimes committed in war? They are trying to win a war. War has been a tent over some of the largest crimes in history and continues to be so. Just because the makers of war say the kettle is white doesnt mean we have to believe it. They are saying in your comment that they want good practiced in war. That does not make sense friend.  They trick people into going to war by presenting Fake good causes and what not. They trick people into dying for thier institutions and the things they care about. I appreciate your comment because it shows you really care because you took the time to tell me about it. I truly believe that "limits on warfare" is "give the dog a bone" to make it sound like they care about limits. war limits Its like calling a ball out of bounds to a ref in a ball game. The game is still won, eh? No matter how many times the ball goes out of bounds. Have you noticed that wars anymore are not about conquering land? They dont want that land. They want a place to fight to sell weapons because its cheaper than running another government. they dont want a govt. that they have to establish, the currency, the actual govt, all the officials, its nothing but headaches. They are all proxy wars. Notice the size of these powerful rulers countries. England, France, Germany. Germany is smaller than california in the usa. Look at Germanys flag

                  &gt;&gt;   After awhile you can see the offsprings of the main countries and who is controling them. why do these small countries have such huge influence in the MSM media? It all in the flags. The Popes flag braggs that he has the keys to YHWH kingdom, but he doesnt it stands for the kingdom thats on earth right now. Call it what you will, but my mind cannot over look the very things they make with thier hands and not on what they say to the people. &lt;&lt;&lt; on a side note, your comments are so pretty, could you teach me how to put a box inside of my comment like you do? If not I understand. :) I like your comments and have learned from you.
