             People will never stop going to disneyland.  People will never stop supporting companies like netflix or cable tv or their favorite movies directed by pedos.  The masses have been conditioned to love entertainment, to be constantly entertained because what on earth would you do if you weren't entertained.  It would be so boring.

              I saw the title of a movie the other day which I have now forgotten. But the producer was Sidney Kimmel in conjunction with Lionsgate which connects him to Frank Giustra. Haven’t found yet whether he’s related to Jimmy K. Would be shocked if he’s not. As we say It’s all connected. Disney must go down. Women are the worst when it comes to Disney. Elsa Bridal Gowns. Gag me with a spoon.
