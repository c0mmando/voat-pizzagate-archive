<p>&quot;As much as I want this to be about weapons, spy rings... it\'s taken an inevitable turn towards the sex angle&quot; (Specifically to do with missing/young black girls in DC)</p>

<p>He repeatedly states &quot;This is not PizzaGate&quot;... </p>
<p>Well, George, you aren\'t wrong very much from what I can tell, but this DOES have to do w/ PizzaGate. PizzaGate = PedoGate. We\'re beyond Comet Ping Pong. </p>
<p>We covered the DC Missing Girls pretty extensively on Voat. &quot;500 young black women disappear in DC each year&quot;... that\'s a lot of missing persons, specifically in a contained geography and a specific demographic. </p>
<p>He then links it to the story of the DC Police that were found to be luring/keeping these girls:

<p>George then dives into the link to Freitag and the crematorium - to explain these girls &quot;complete disappaearances&quot; and ends the video by stating &quot;it\'s getting worse&quot;.</p>
<p>Related transcript quotes from prior Webb videos, linking Freitag\'s crematorium to the location, as a possible method of making bodies vanish that could be related to these missing/abducted young girls:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That makes this Freitag\'s hotspot–he owns this–this is his jurisdiction I believe also this area as well</p>
<p>And the CIA has contracted around the world with these Undertakers that can have crematoriums that can get rid of a body in an hour</p>

            Props to George Webb for keeping this stuff updated on YouTube.   Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know some of you hate the guy and think George Webb is controlled opposition because he hasn't been whacked for speaking out, but my litmus test is the following:  is he bringing the stories to the forefront?  YES.  He's ballsy.  He's unconventional.  He's very intelligent.  He's persistent.  He's doing a hell of a lot more to bring this stuff up into the public domain than I could ever do, and he's creative.  I started out watching him very, very, very early on.  I was worried about Eric Braverman and Webb was the only one on YouTube discussing.  I applaud Webb for starting small and following the story wherever it led him.  For me, anyways, he was the first one who put the Awan Brothers/DNC/Noodles story into context.  He broke that bad boy, as far as I can tell.  So if you read this place, George, mad props, thanks for the info, and stay safe and productive.

             I doubt he's reading our stuff here on Voat - but, I do everything I can to support him (via Patreon) and have offered additional services. I think our homeboy is totally underwater in terms of his truly trusted friends/associates. I wish I had the brainpower to be part of that team, but, I happily watch on the sidelines and commend everything he is doing.

            <p>
             About 3-4 months ago, he was being attacked mercilessly... even here on Voat, and I stood up to every attack I could to defend him.
            </p>
            <p>
             He is a hero IMHO.

              .  George Webb is doing great work and I'm sure he does it at tremendous personal expense.  He has sacrificed his time, comfort, and safety to travel and make those videos, and because he's trying to dig up the truth, I give him lots of credit.  Is he perfect?  Nope.  But no one on earth is perfect.  He is, however, TRYING.  And, best of all, he is not a self-promoting,  money-grubbing windbag, like David Seaman.   George Webb seems to be walking the walk.  He's done a hell of a lot more than I could ever do, so I give him lots of credit.  He makes us THINK.  He gives us LEADS.  Because of his bravery he's red pilled the world.  I don't know him.  Never will.. I just applaud him and pray for his safet from the sidelines....

            George Webb has zero credibility as evidenced by all the people who have distanced themselves from him. He is a public menace and should be carted away by men in white coats.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's nice that he can finally tie-in some Muslims to deflect away from Mossad's spying and sex crimes.

              He has told too many lies and ignores people when they are trying to tell him the truth. If it doesn't fit his narrative then he ignores it.

              How long did it take him to finally admit that Imran Awan has US citizenship? When he finally had to admit it, it blew his other ridiculous theories out of the water. Do yourself a favour and stop drinking his kool aid.

            GW has always known that it involves pizzagate. He also knows that it involves Israel, the Rothschilds, and freemasons.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can no longer keep up with all of his videos, but in last couple of weeks he has started talking about masons and secret societies, which he never did before.
           </p>
           <p>
            GW once sent me a random message on facebook about the Awans and pizza. It freaked me out. But I was glad that he reached out to me, because I pushed pizzagate hard when he was just starting on youtube.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not sure what kind of limited hangout GW is. He seems to virtually always tell the truth (like Wikileaks). But he also avoids certain topics (pizza, Mossad, Rothschild). I get the sense that he wants to do the right thing. I also get the sense that the truth about the whole conspiracy is inevitably going to come out in the age of the internet, and certain people want to get ahead of the story. There also seems to be a sense in which the deep state is just throwing HRC under the bus.

            <p>
             That is insane that he messaged you about the Awans and Pizza that long ago. Do you happen to have the message itself? I'd be curious.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for the topics he's avoided, or at least mostly avoids. I think he's intentionally trying to stay out of the weeds. Pizzagate would get him attention he doesn't want, Mossad is something I'm sure he regrets bringing up - but he's addressed it/admitted to it multiple times, and the Rothschilds... whew, I'm pretty sure he's fully aware that this is similar to going after Soros directly.

            <p>
             If he is disinfo or a Mossad agent and somehow attempting to intentionally steer us away from the truth as part of some deeper-than-deep-state operation to ultimately protect the PTB? Well, then, in that case, he's going to be etched in our history as the Apex Shill, the Alpha Online Persona. The most effective, convincing and impossibly complex disinfo agent ever engineered.

              <li>
               Only one crematorium is within any reasonable proximity (within 10 miles) of the area of operations - #4 Demain Funeral home.  This is a very old NoVA business with a sterling reputation.  But, we know that doesn't mean anything either.  There are no other funeral homes with crematory services that I can identify within any reasonable proximity of the Springfield Metro.

              <li>
               That being said, there is another crematory not listed:
               <a href="https://www.sunsetpetservices.com/">
                https://www.sunsetpetservices.com/
               </a>
               - maybe/maybe not?  If I were disposing of bodies, taking a vehicle to a pet crematorium at the end of a junky industrial park is a lot less conspicuous than going to a big funeral home on a major road.

              Metro: For clarification, the Metro stop is on the blue line at Springfield Mall.  The mall is well known for having many crime problems since the Metro opened a station there.  It is very common for black youth to come in from DC and cause problems at the mall (carjacking, drug dealing, grand theft, murder, etc.)  Robert E. Lee HS is on the other side of the mall from the Metro and is less than a 10 minute walk.  Easy access.  It would be very easy for an online persona to persuade a teen to come in from the city for sex, drugs, etc. then capture them as needed.

              Recent murder:  The Lorton VA area is right off of I-95 and has become a favored area of "MS-13" to execute and/or dump bodies.  The Awan properties, the HVAC company, the rental house where the Marine discovered the hard drives, the HVAC business, Lee HS, South County HS, etc. are all within a 3-5 mile range from each other.  This is "their" stomping grounds.  A recent bizarre murder occurred weeks before the arrest of Awan:

               https://fairfaxnews.com/2017/08/suspect-arrested-lorton-double-murder/
              </a>
              While on the surface this looks like a drug deal gone bad.  If you dig, you will find the victims were flaming homosexuals, at least by appearance, they were driving a nice Acura, in a nice neighborhood, and though supposedly from Stafford VA, there is a photo out there of the crime scene, with the victim's car, and it does not have VA plates (they look like the Don't Tread on Me Plates), but have what looks to be NY plates.  This is a wealthy community and generally quiet.  There are a lot of unusual murders in this area which, for lack of a better description, has generally been crime free. [Note: DC's prison was located in Lorton and was active for 111 years until it closed about 15 years ago]

              Once you start digging in, it becomes hard with the hadji names to figure things out.  You will notice that some of the pseudonyms are also regional names.  Think of it as you moving to J-Bad and saying you are "Zebediah from Amish Country".  It would make about as much sense to them as some of these names do to us.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyhow, a lot of these businesses have owners of one name, on property of another name, with a mortgage in a third name.  While it may look like different people, often it is akin to having the same with a name like Robert Johannsen, Bob Johannsen, and Bobby Johannsen on 3 different legal documents.  All legal.  It just doesn't make sense to us.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also understand that Springfield, Alexandria, and Lorton are pretty much seamless suburban areas.  The same way Bethesda, Kensington, Chevy Chase are.  Or other areas of DC.  Or Alexandria, Falls Church, Arlington.  All of these areas have nebulous boundaries with no real distinction as you transition.   Hopefully that helps understand the layout a bit better.

            I've mentioned it before here, but I think it's worth pointing out again.  There is a Trello board being maintained that is continuously updated with all the new information that George and the citizen investigators have found.  It's a public board, and I think searchable by the search engines.  For all the people who want to discredit GW just because he's Jewish, or tall, or wears black shirts, or whatever, I would also like to point out that the information he cites is from publicly available sources, and where he speculates, he makes it clear that's what he's doing.  The link to the board is here. I invite you all to look at it yourselves and make your own decisions.

            He knows it is pizzagate but sees that many people have tried to relegate this to pizza shops. He does not want that label because he is going after the root evil. He wants everyone to understand unless we pull out the roots (Awan spying,CIA spying, JTTF which is just CIAcwith law enforcement powers in US) the Senate Foriegn Affairs and arms cartel, money laundering and massive heroin shipping into US

             Exactly. I get what he's doing... for the minority of people who even know what Pizzagate is, a much smaller minority understands that it's far beyond a Pizza Shop in DC. He's playing the numbers game and trying to keep this above board.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's very similar to how he reminds everyone "I don't want anyone to go to jail, I just want this to all stop". There's no way people who are exposed can avoid jail time, these are serious crimes from any angle he touches on. But by saying this, he keeps it clean/sticks to his research and keeps pushing forward.

              Exactly, he states things like that to keep himself alive.....if he went after one guy he would be dead. The reason he videotapes everything is so if he is murdered it is on film. He released DeadMan switches last December...if they kill him it is all coming out.
             </p>
             <p>
              I speak to him and am heavily involved.,I too am targeted...was jumped, beat up and threatened at my home in a gated community. Was told to keep my fucking mouth shut as four men punched me in the head.
             </p>
             <p>
              Not keeping my mouth shut...I have DM switches as well.

               That's interesting that you suffer no reprisals here on coat as I do.  They just jumped straight to a beatdown with you, and here you are again with unbroken fingers, getting revenge. You go girl!

                yes there is a massive investigation you fuck...you do not realize who the fuck you are talking to and not just me....My beatdown and subsequent carjacking involved 4 men...I fought them with my fists because they were tailing me to enter the house. Since I get threatening phone calls telling me I will be sexually assaulted from Washington DC it seems I touched a nerve....and I know how to fight which according to police, paramedics, helicopter pilots, and others on scene that fight in me saved my life.....you would have pissed your pants and cried for you mommy. I hope to God we never have to go to war again because pussies like you would be waving a white flag as soon as they heard the first shot.....fuck off and go back to playing in the basement with toy soldiers and Barbie dolls.

                That's because you have repeatedly demonstrated that you are a genuine hack and partisan to the pedo cause, especially as it pertains to defending Muslim involvement in pedogate.

             Exactly. Preemptive discrediting was certainly done... For the MSM - it's the same 3 narratives: "Fakes News", "Russia" or "Racism/Islamaphobia" That's how they plan to explain all of this away.

            I wouldn't trust a Jewish person to discuss crematoriums.  They try to convince you millions of corpses were cremated in a couple years, which is OBVIOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE IF YOU GIVE IT ONE FUCKING MOMENT'S THOUGHT! How long does it take for a body to turn to ash? Like 20 minutes? Do the fucking math LMAO

            Who, specifically, was implicated in whatever the HVAC company was implicated in? Was Abbas shown to be personally involved in whatever this was?

            Who is Freitag? What is the link to Freitag? Is he linked at all or does Webb only mention him in the next sentence?
