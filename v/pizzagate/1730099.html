<p>You\'ll need to watch the video but he basically says he was involved with a life insurance scam and his &quot;circle&quot; was in on a plan to kill him, and that led to him investing them and creating the &quot;russian dossier&quot; and providing it to the FBI.

            Interesting...there is something off about him which in my view gives this more credibility. Seems hesitant, scared.

             If

            this IS the same guy, these videos will be deleted under premise of 'national security' and all traces of this info is to be censored in 3...2...1...

             unless these videos were created to paint him under a certain light and are meant to be discovered. His facebook is private, his instagram is private, his twitter had no activity before 2 weeks ago. There is nothing on this guy before March 5th other than him retweeting a bunch of Trump/Pizzagate stuff starting Jan 2017.

             Initially I thought he was an actor as there is an actor who lives in the same city with the name of Jonathan T Tran; and who looks very similar. However after finding video of the actor I had to conclude that they were separate people.
            </p>
            <p>
             To clarify, the guy in the youtube videos I posted above, and the intruder interviewed by the news are the same person.

             But there's no reason to believe that story. His evidence for "before it broke" was months after the dossier was already circulating and the dossier went way, way beyond his claims.  Did his fan fic include a deal involving the sale of 19% of the Russian state oil company?  Because it Decemeber Russia did sell 19.5% of the Russian oil company in a deal that is still shrowded in secrecy including who got the brokerage fee?  People think that .5% is the brokerage fee on the deal.  Did the fan fic include the detail that Trump personal lawyer was meeting with Kremlin representatives? Or that payments for the Russian hackers working in the US were routed through the Russian pension payment system that routinely sends money former Russian living in the US.
            </p>
            <p>
             I noted this previously.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              4Channers might believe this but that is not how US intel works.
             </p>
             <p>
              This dossier on Trump has been going around a while and reporters have been trying to confirm this stuff for months. The "sexual" part is just a small part of this. This dossier was compiled by a real person, with genuine experience and contacts in Russia and it was started before Trump had the nomination. He is ex MI6 and now works for a private firm Does that mean all of his stuff is gold? No, it does not. However, what is being reported tonight is that the Intel Agencies have checked out the source network and now believe there is enough credibility to the charges that some of this info was briefed to the President and President elect.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Since the dossier was leaked, US Intel agencies have corroborated some of it.  Specifically, the dossier said certain conversations took place at certain times and places with certain people, and we know now this did happen.

               Yes. He is a known CTR troll, so he helps point the way with his lies.

                  The video doesn't really make sense. How does it go from evidence on his roommate and family to trump? I'm not even getting what angle they're saying.

                   is an exposed troll. I am uncertain on the video as there are many ways to interpret it. I have gotten some information that at least part is legit, and if correct, the person who informed me said that we would never again hear of Jonathan Tran. We should see what happens to the case because the prediction is that he will be buried if his posts were legit.

            He jumps from a story about a roommate who was into kiddie porn into the dossier and the White House with virtually no segue.  WTF?  No supportive documents, just his word for it . And he "Didn't feel safe" before but he does now?

             His story absolutely sounds like bs, or more specifically; like he's crazy. He rambles and thinks he's made his point or showed evidence when in fact he hasn't. He's either CIA ( there have been claims that 2 of his former employers have cia connections) or he does need a mental health evaluation.
