            , could you repost this as a Discuss post with a bit more explanation of how Clinton is supposedly connected, and how this is directly related to the sexual abuse of kids by the elite? Quotes from the video with timestamps to the relevant portions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. Removing under Rule 1 and 3.

             I'm going to have trouble as it was taken from a comment after a vid already linked here. The person making the comment assumed everyone reading it was up on the latest Pizzagate info, as am I. It was actually part of a discussion taking part in the comments field relating several of the videos of the author as well as others. Agreed you'd be lost if you didn't know all of the previous info being discussed. I also want to stay completely out of some of this discussion as I work in acting/comedy in Hollywood and don't want to be blacklisted. However I do know a lot of background info that's never been discussed on VOAT nor Reddit. So maybe I should just not post? I wish I knew of a way to divulge info to a Moderator for his/her own discretion and posting on another's name. This would include comments I've found online of real relevance, as well as videos that may or may not be new or related directly. In any case if you don't understand the entire history of film financing up to current day, and why some actors/actresses are chosen for parts despite questionable looks and/or talent, you won't understand the entire worldwide sex trade industry. What goes for over age 18 performers is even more true of children. It's been printed in books such as a biography of Natalie Wood. You've got parents who see their offspring as their lifetime meal ticket. Girls used to be valued only as a way to bring praise to their parents. True today in some families even of adult women. So to what extent did Corey Haim try to seduce everyone around him who could really help his career? How about those that got their start performing as young teens who were also street hustlers and drug dealers to top execs? Called a "party favor." I've watched the underage of both sexes seek out a sugar by offering a ready and quick supply of top quality drugs available for personal delivery 24/7. I've an unusual rep as everyone knows I've never smoked anything nor used any drugs. Just know and have seen lots of stories. Hollywood mothers openly encourage their underage kids to seduce those of wealth. Then there's wholesome looking lesbian star who died almost the same time as her still famous daughter. Interesting to those in the know as mother was overly involved in an incestuous way in her daughter's sex life, watching and coaching as well. Or the famous mother will start the young child out by having 3-ways with a series of men in the entertainment industry with $$$$. Or the mother will drug the uncooperative or shy child with coke. Lots of stories I've seen.

              Yeah...I can only imagine the depth of the real mess. It's really too bad it can't all be brought to light. Ultimately, the industry (which is really just a bunch of people) will become so corrupt and warped it will totally and completely lose the ability to appeal to normal people. In many ways, it already has. It's sad, really. When a culture loses it's storytelling ability, it loses it's ability to maintain it's identity and adapt to change.

            I don't know if this thread is completely truthful or not. Please delete if it isn't OK. Supposedly connects Janet Reno and Hillary Clinton to WACO. Believe cult leader David Koresh was sexually abusing his &amp; follower's kids. All kinds of rumors from Day-1 of  "We Ain't Coming Out."
