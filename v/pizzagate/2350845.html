<blockquote>
<p>A man who was convicted of trying to meet a 14-year-old girl he had sexually groomed and promised to kill and eat in England is now in the Washington County Jail.</p>
<p>...Bolinger, dubbed the “Canterbury Cannibal,” chatted with the teenager on a website called the Dark Fetish Network. In those conversations, he described sex acts he wanted to perform on her and how he would murder her</p>
<p>...Bolinger told police he started having fantasies about cannibalism at about the age of six</p>
<p>...Though details are unclear, Bolinger\'s sentence was commuted and he was immediately deported [from UK back to the USA]</p>
<p>...The latest jail list issued by the Washington County Sheriff\'s Office Monday showed Bolinger as part of the jail population.</p>
<p>[Washing county sheriff] said he was not notified about Bolinger\'s past, only that he received an email from the Nebraska State Patrol (NSP) that a registered sex offender was moving into the county... then received a tip that he should look further into Bolinger\'s convictions.</p>
<p>“We did and that\'s when we found out his past,” Robinson said. “It was very concerning.”</p>
<p>Robinson was frustrated that he had not received more information prior to Bolinger moving into the county.</p>
<p>“We don\'t know why we weren\'t notified. Since they knew he was going to be living in Washington County, why didn\'t they invite us to go to the airport with them to meet him,” Robinson said. “Why he wasn\'t directed to register directly here so we would have a little bit better understanding of his past. We don\'t know. We don\'t have any answers yet.”</p>
<p>Vander Schaaf also expressed his concern on the lack of communication.</p>
<p>“Mr. Bolinger\'s convictions in England do not tell the story, at least in my opinion” he said.</p>
<p>Robinson said deputies increased their patrol presence in Bolinger\'s neighborhood after receiving concerns from neighbors last week.</p>
<p>“When you hear those twisted fantasies, it\'s absolutely a big concern. We have to be concerned,” Robinson said. “I don\'t think there is anyone here that would want somebody like that to be their neighbor, especially if they have young children.”</p>
