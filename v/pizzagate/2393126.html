            I've linked Podesta with the biotech industry in Geneva here:

            <p>
             Since we know that the Podesta's have some kind of family connection to Swizerland and seem to have some kind of base in Lausanne, I thought I'd do a search for his name with that of Bertarelli, and here comes a wikileaks email:

            <p>
             The second change is that we have just heard that unfortunately Mr. Bertarelli had a family matter come up, and although he was looking forward to the dinner he won't be able to join you after all. Instead, Bertarelli Foundation Director Mark Bolland will join you. Appended here is Mr. Bolland's biography:
            </p>
            <p>
             Mark Bolland: Director, Bertarelli Foundation &amp; Group Communications Director, Waypoint Capital Holdings
            </p>
            <p>
             A chemisty graduate, Mark started his career in the media at the UK's Advertising Standards Authority, where he was head of research and adviser to the organisation's Director-General. In 1992 he was appointed as the first ever Director of the UK's Press Complaints Commission.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              In 1996 he became Deputy Private Secretary to HRH The Prince of Wales, with responsibility for media relations and the Prince's interests in healthcare, the environment, and architecture.
             </strong>
             Having served in the position for six years, he left in 2002 to establish his own consultancy business, which provided communications advice to businesses, individuals and charities.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since 2008 he has been a Trustee of both The Helen Hamlyn Trust and its educational initiative "Open Futures". He is also a Trustee of the David Ross Foundation and the David Ross Education Trust, which sponsors a number of school Academies in the United Kingdom.

            Rule 3:  You need to logically connect all this somehow, ideally with a concise summary at the top.  Otherwise, it comes off as one of our resident troll's patented "baffle with bullshit" posts.  Right

             This post didn't come off that way to me...maybe because I know all the pieces are legit, rather than some hokey crap about King David and Knights Templar, etc. It is difficult, with complex webs of relationships like this, to write a post that ties things up neatly in a bow. Generally that's what editors would do with a writer's piece to prepare it for publication. But we're dealing with raw research, here. It's difficult, especially for those who are writers by trade.

              Nobody's asking for that.  I'm just asking for

              explaining why the pieces are perceived to be connected (the required description of link content and how links relate to the post as a whole).

               OP explained it fine. Well enough to interest researchers, known and reliable researchers in this forum, to participate. These participants are not shills. These are some of the brightest minds in the pizzagate research community. Prove to me that they are not. The burden of proof IS ON YOU.

                letsdothis1, your persistance is commendable. Here's what helps me: ask yourself "What is my premise?" See if you can formulate the sum total of the whole post as a single sentence that you are trying to prove or disprove. Then, stick that right at the front -- and line up the rest of the info nuggets you've got to support that premise. Protip: This is the very last thing you do. Often, there's no way to articulate this when you first start writing the thread. You just have a bunch of juicy stuff and a hunch. But making the effort to distill all that material into a premise that can be proven or disproven is a great service to us all and really helps focus everyone's research efforts.
               </p>

                Don't give up. I really think you are onto something.

                  Capturing your angle in a "premise" or "hypothesis" is not easy, but it is a great discipline and I have found it makes me a better writer and thinker. Also, it generates much more animated discussion, as people have a clear target to aim at, pro or con. ;-)

                   Btw vindicator, I've been meaning to ask you what kind of writing do you do?  You mentioned something about academia, so I presume it's non-fiction?  What's your field?

                    I started out as a newspaper reporter but couldn't take the bullshit. I then did freelance business writing and editing for ten years or so, including some ghostwriting, until I quit to write a novel. The manuscript won a regional writing competition award and was going strong, but I got in a really bad car accident and ended up with neck injuries and migraines that forced me to stop writing for years. Still recovering from that. I've never done academic writing -- for me, it's all about the story. I do have one nonfiction book that has been translated into multiple languages, but it's more how-to than academic. Has a lot of footnotes and support material, though. :-)

                 Yes it is. Your comprehension of all the material is not a rule in this forum. You are exceeding your mandate. We are sick of your censorship. this poster that made this post is one of the best posters in the forum and intellectually is far above you. You can see from the very PRODUCTIVE comments that researchers were connecting the dots. Since when did your agreement and understanding of all the material beocme a rule? I am throwing doen the gauntlet and I will continue to fight for our right to research up until the minute I am banned.

            Speaking of Abramovic....there's an article about her in today's
            <em>
             Guardian
            </em>
            , and guess what? They mention Pizzagate! ;-)
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             While her own performance work is linked with shamanistic rituals, the far right have misunderstood her art as Satanism.
            </p>
            <p>
             Her work surfaced during the Pizzagate scandal of 2016, where one of Abramovic’s emails to Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta (brother of Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta) refers to a “Spirit Cooking,” which is the name of an artwork she made in 1996. It was assumed to be an occult ritual.
            </p>
            <p>
             “People can so easily put labels, we are afraid of everything,” she said. “I talk openly on every single subject in my work, it’s very important to understand it and put it in the right context.”

            But it doesn't stop there, there's an opinion piece by The Guardian's art critic, who some time ago argued in favour of a painting of Balthus, creator of pedophile art at the MoMa.

             That's how they are trying to bury the truth of the web of corruption.  Think of this web as a series of layers as well (pyramid), trying  to keep it at the mainstream version of pizzagate i.e. Comet Ping Pong and Hillary lurking in the basement.  We also have one or two mods here who 'seem' to think and act along those lines - rather like trying to close the gate after the horses have bolted.

             . However, the installation was later exhibited at other locations, developing new meanings in this way. Currently exhibited together with 'Luminosity', which shows Abramovic naked on a bicycle seat attached to a steel construction, casting shadows against a white wall, 'Dissolution' and 'Insomnia' refer to various themes recurring in Abramovic's work, from trauma and cultural memory to the idea of putting the stamina of the body to the test in order to reach a higher state of consciousness."
