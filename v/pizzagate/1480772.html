<p>24 Jun 2014</p>
<p><strong>Video Transcript</strong></p>
<p>FBI Director James B. Comey:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Operation Cross Country is an effort that has gone on over the last week, in 106 cities, involving almost 400 law enforcement agencies, designed to rescue children who have been sold into the sex trade.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leslie R. Caldwell, Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the coming weeks and months, the Justice Department’s criminal division through its child exploitation and obscenity section, will work with the FBI to follow leads developed from this operation to prosecute and incapacitate the worst offenders; to rescue additional victims to dismantle local and national criminal networks that traffic in children. ...</p>
<p>We need the PUBLIC\'S HELP to find these children and providing that help is simple. Anyone with information that may involve the prostitution of children can contact the National Human Trafficking Resource Center or the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Just one call, just one online report could mean all the difference for a child who now can only dream of a normal childhood and a life outside prostitution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Ryan, CEO, National Center for Missing and Exploited Children:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People don’t want to believe that children are being sold for sex, not in this country, but once again, operation cross country eight provides irrefutable evidence that they are; on street corners, in hotels, at truck stops, and increasingly on the Internet.</p>
<p>We <strong>know</strong> that missing children—especially children missing from the child welfare system are being targeted by traffickers.</p>
<p>Increasingly they are utilizing technology and recruiting online via social networking sites. The traffickers are using the mobile devices to stay in contact with the victims, maintain control over them, and actually capture the images documenting their abuse.</p>
<p>…But for operations like this, these children likely would never have been found.</p>
<p>Today, as a result of their efforts, 168 children now have the opportunity to recapture their lives.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kathryn Turman, Director of the FBI’s Office for Victim Assistance: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The needs of the young victims are many and complex. Many of the children, who become victims of commercial sexual exploitation, were previously victims of abuse and neglect by the people who were charged with protecting and caring for them.</p>
<p>The cost of not doing enough to protect and assist child victims is enormous. More than three million reports of abuse involving more than six million children are made in the U.S. every single year.</p>
<p>Doing all we can to bring these children with their often invisible wounds out of the shadows is our mission and our privilege. A hundred years ago a wise man stated, “If the children are safe, then everyone is safe.” Victimization profoundly jeopardizes the healthy development of children and compromises their futures. It’s our collective future as well, thank you.</p>

            This is quite interesting... particularly NCMEC involvement. A road show? A scouting? Legitimate education. It's terrifying that we might never know. Perhaps there are clues in the information presented.

            National Center for Missing and Exploited Children - this has come up several times as connected with LOADS of suspect people, the Clinton Foundation etc. So it might be that they are using this to get information, both about what people know, who knows it, where leakages and who whistleblowers might be, and also as a way of getting their hands on more kids. In the UK it's believed that a similar organisation ostensibly for the protection of children actually uses its hotline to intercept any reports of paedophile rings/abuse etc and as a way of finding more vulnerable kids to abuse. :-(

              NSPCC (National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children), they launched Childlike, which is for kids to call if they're being abused. The woman who founded Childlike, Esther Rantzen has been accused of all kinds of hideous stuff, she was basically up to her neck in paedophiles, including Jimmy Saville, and one of her boyfriends was an MP who ended up convicted of child abuse, plus someone else was convicted of child abuse after having molested a 5 year old girl at her house, where he was her guest. So all these poor kids would go and tell her what had happened to them, because she was meant to be the founder of Childline and all about saving kids, but then she would ignore them and basically cover it all up.

            Want to know how it works the relation between CIA &amp; FBI?
           </p>
           <p>
            Think about Columbian Cocaine, so long as Escobar was trading Cocaine in US Dollars CIA/FBI was all good with his biz, but then he got the bright idea of asking for EURO's, then all hell came down on him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thus the entire job of FBI/CIA is to make sure that all black markets are trading in US DOLLARS, because the black market is the real demand for $100 US Franklins.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Black Market is
           </p>
           <p>
            OIL
BLOOD, HUMAN
KIDS
DRUGS
ORGANS
           </p>
           <p>
            The CIA/FBI job is just to make sure biz is transacted in usDOLLARS after that its all good.

             Regardless of the details (oil, cocaine) its the machine behind the CIA calling the shots. That's never going to change.

            Good post.  I was unaware of this and adds a lot of credibility to #pizzagate.

            They are fogging! They know all the competition in human trafficking for recruitment and such, and in desperation they are going after them to satisfy the hunger people have for justice.

             Yes, I think nearly all, if not everything, of the information that is made available of the subject, regardless of the context, is just to keep the guise of caring and that they're doing something.

            <p>
             That's not agreeable
