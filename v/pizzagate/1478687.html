<p>Young Majerteen boys sold to foreign pedophiles</p>
<p>Postby Intruder » 29 Aug 2005 23:24
How many Majerteen young virgin Dhiloyen did Afbjio scarify to the Saudi Pedophiles to get 70 million dollars? Insiders say not enough, however, over 1000 young Majerteen boys 10 years old and under were presented to the Saudi Pedophiles in a good will gesture for the 70 million dollars aid package.</p>
<p>================================================
[Somali interim president, Mr. Abdulahi Yusuf Ahmed is back home in Jowhar, Somalia after a week-long visit to Saudi Arabia. Mr. Ahmed and his delegation were welcomed my senior Somali government officials and crowds of well wishers, many in cultural attire. Jowhar is the governmentÃ¢Â€Â™s temporary headquarters.</p>
<p>During his visit in Saudi Arabia, the president met with King Abdulaziz and other senior Saudi officials. According to Somali ministry of information, the visit was success and the Saudi Kingdom promised to help Somalia financially. Veterinarians will be sent to Somalia in order to assess health condition of Somalia\'s livestock for possible resumption of Saudi importation of Somali livestock. Somali livestock were banned from Saudi Arabia in 2000.</p>
<p>Unconfirmed reports say the president came back smiling after King Abdulaziz donated seventy million dollars for rehabilitation and reconstruction of Somalia.]</p>',

            Oh, look at these Saudis, so rapey, so evil. Forget about the pizza. Be distracted. Investigating Saudis is dead end until we can get rid of the elite filth protecting them.
