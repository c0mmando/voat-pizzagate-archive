<pre><code> Carlos is very much into the technology of electronic Identification cards.
</code></pre>

<p>eIDs  are now used for private and secure communications.<br />
“For customers that intend to use many digital eIDs for financial transactions, securing email, authentication to web sites and other purposes, the CertifyID BlackBox product editions are the best choice.  Governments and countries are rapidly adopting eID cards as the most secure infrastructure for providing eGovernment services. WISeKey’s National Identity System and CertifyID Trust Centre Platform address the needs of such clients.”</p>

<pre><code>  He works with the  Clinton Foundation though an organization called OISTE whose mission is to make sure the poor have connectivity. 

 However, the Clintons and other globalist have more on their agenda than that, they want everyone to have on an electronic ID card, especially those in underdeveloped countries,  under the pretense making  access to healthcare and other such services more available.
</code></pre>

<p>“At the local level (the village, district, or in some cases the urban level) the NETeID system will provide citizens holding a digital identification with information about, for instance, basic social services, such as financial aid, health and education. At the national level the Digital Identification will bring the citizens more complex Web Services that carry information about jobs, investment opportunities or goods and services. Finally, at the broadest level, the NETeID System will inter connect to the global information infrastructure provided by agencies providing poverty alleviation services and will federate participating agencies into a global Federated System using Single Sign On technologies to allow citizens to access all these services from a single entry point via a Generic Poverty Alleviation Portal. Each higher level usually includes elements of the preceding levels.
The NETeID is designed in a way that handles all types of interventions simultaneously via a dashboard, with those that directly benefit the poor coming in first. This usually happens at the local level and the impact is always more visible. The NETeID system also considers a broader definition of poverty, where poverty is also defined as being deprived of the information and basic services needed to participate in the \'global\' society. WISekey and OISTE are working with International Organizations, such as the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and NGOs that have been implementing these services.”</p>

            This was posted in a thread earlier. This is the CARDS everyone has been searching for. They are RFID chips or implants that are placed under the skin that have complete identities, medical info., &amp; worse that are connected to human trafficking, organ harvesting, buying children.
           </p>
           <p>
            These chips are a big part of the refugee program mandatory chipping programs.

             The data has been posted here on Voat several times. Numerous patients have been scanned and found to have RFID chips and had them removed. It would literally be impossible to find if not by chance. This was written into healthcare law in 2009. Will get the HR # for you. It was estimated then that through full enactment of ACH by 2017 all US citizens would be microchipped. The failure of the law has prevented this but they are desperately trying. There is a company in the US that has had the patent for a very longtime.
