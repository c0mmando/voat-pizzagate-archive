Rodham began a year of postgraduate study on children and medicine at the Yale Child Study Center.[59] In late 1973 her first scholarly article, &quot;Children Under the Law&quot;, was published in the Harvard Educational Review.[60] Discussing the new children\'s rights movement, it stated that &quot;child citizens&quot; were &quot;powerless individuals&quot;[61] and argued that children should not be considered equally incompetent from birth to attaining legal age, but instead that courts should presume competence except when there is evidence otherwise, on a case-by-case basis.[62] The article became frequently cited in the field.[63]</p>

The North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) is a pedophile and pederasty advocacy organization in the United States. It works to abolish age-of-consent laws criminalizing adult sexual involvement with minors[2][3] and campaigns for the release of men who have been jailed for sexual contacts with minors that did not involve coercion.</p>
<p>And if I am not mistaken, the two things are related by their dates. I would be curious to discover which came first, the chicken or the egg -- Hillary\'s article? or the formation of NAMBLA --- and maybe even see if there is a tie to Soros</p>',

            This is just a crazy post.
           </p>
           <p>
            Are you claiming Hillary Clinton hasn't been examined?  That no one before has thought about looking into Hillary Clinton's writing?  Do you think someone of VOAT is going to find something in her Academic career that nobody else has?  You don't think that maybe some of her political opponents would have thought to download this article?
           </p>
           <p>
            And there's no honest way to jump from her position to NAMBLA.  There is zero connection between the publishing of her article and the founding of NAMBLA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Have you actually read this?

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It's pretty much an in depth discussion of her writings on Children's Law.   And it's 25 years old.   And the very first sentence says people are misrepresenting her views.  And you here you are MISREPRESENTING HER VIEWS and citing that article. You are doing a reboot of a smear campaign from two and a half decades ago during the 1992 election.  And if you read your own links, you would find there is nothing to support the smear campaign.   Her legal scholarship is now accepted as mainstream law.  All this has to do with the 1992 election, folks like Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson denounced her writings at the Republican convention and throughout the campaign.

             They accused her of comparing marriage to slavery, and of favoring the right of children to sue their parents over such mundane matters as taking out the garbage. ....
What Hillary Clinton actually believes bears little resemblance to the caricature drawn by the Republicans. .... While mildly radical at the time, Clinton's views are now accepted as standard fare by the American Bar Association. "I've read everything Hillary Clinton has written on this topic, and it's very clear she's writing about abused and neglected kids, cases where the courts are already involved," says Howard Davidson of the ABA's Center on Children and the Law.
Mrs. Clinton insists that she is not trying to give children a blanket right to sue. "There is no way that anybody could fairly read the article and say I was advocating that children sue parents over taking the garbage out," she told NEWSWEEK. The article makes it clear that she would reserve the right for children who suffer from extreme cases of abuse or neglect.

 References throughout this page point to the issue of "age of consent" as an attempt to ostracize homosexuals. A Boston DA refused to indict 24 men who had been busted for porn material and sex with young boys saying that there was no evidence that COERCION was involved. Thus, the legal argument for eliminating an arbitrary "age of consent" -- which seems to have been Hillary's theme -- has borne fruit in the legal arena of prosecuting pedophiles. I guess if the kids enjoyed it, then no crime was committed??? If the kids found a monetary benefit then no coercion was involved??? The argument surely becomes quite twisted and the practice of GROOMING children becomes a pedophile's redemption??
            </p>
            <p>
             Hillary's acclaim by others in the "childrens' rights movement" may be based on the good side of this issue -- children who are abused and misunderstood by parents -- but it is also a stepping stone to the further argument that "children are not abused if they give consent to that abuse."

              As I read further into the same linked page I found a reference to Jesse Helm:
             </p>
             <p>
              "The case of ILGA illustrates this opposition. In 1993, the International Lesbian and Gay Association, of which NAMBLA had been a member for a decade, achieved United Nations consultative status. NAMBLA's association with ILGA drew heavy criticism, and many gay organizations called for the ILGA to dissolve ties with NAMBLA. Republican Senator Jesse Helms proposed a bill to withhold $119 million in U.N. contributions until U. S. President Bill Clinton could certify that "no UN agency grants any official status, accreditation, or recognition to any organization which promotes, condones, or seeks the legalization of pedophilia, that is, the sexual abuse of children". The bill was unanimously approved by Congress and signed into law by Clinton in April 1994."
             </p>
             <p>
              Draw your own conclusions. Jesse Helms wanted to compel Clinton to do this??
             </p>
             <p>
              From court documents, there was a link to a corporation that provided funding for NAMBLA
             </p>
             <p>
              ":"The Steering Committee, through several of its members, also formed "Zymurgy, Inc.," a Delaware corporation, which was operated as a profit-making arm of NAMBLA. Although the defendants describe the Bulletin, Gayme Magazine, Ariel's Pages, and Zymurgy, Inc. as separate and distinct from NAMBLA, it appears from the materials submitted, including minutes of Steering Committee meetings, that the Steering Committee controlled all of these entities, providing monies to initiate and support various projects and freely transferring funds among them."

             if you're dumbfounded how AreWeSure could say Killary Clinton is pro-children you're not alone. I found out the best way to make sense of AreWeSure's defense of Killary is to add "middle class and above" before the word "children".
            </p>
            <p>
             Obviously if you've seen
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LYRUOd_QoM">
              "Clinton Cash"
             </a>
             or read how Hillary Clinton got convicted child trafficker Laura Silsby released from jail early down in Haiti you know Killary is no fan of poor children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Poor children of any race to Hillary are Brownstone Operation fuel and the ugly ones are "organs on the hoof" if you will.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hope this helps. I've learned this after 6 months of AreWeSure's extreme distaste at any evidence pointing to any rich white people from Yale having committed any crime ever in the history of the universe.

            The Pedo Elite took a page from Hitler's playbook in covering evil with a "noble" purpose. So this push to give "powerless" children rights in making their own decisions translates into a three-year-old consenting to illegal sexual perversity so they can be a tool for the Cannibal Elite. Really disgusting stuff. Hope someone reads this and gives a summary.

            Yes, that does sound like NAMBLA. How could Saul Alinsky politicians get so far in this country? Hillary was a true believer in undermining society.
