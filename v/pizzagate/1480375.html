            Yes! This is why I love the USA so much. What a miracle the Constitution was! How amazing to found a nation on laws designed to weaken and divide power, rather than amass it in the hands of a few cronies! Amazing. We must restore our government to that ideal, now!

            I would spend an hour or two once a week volunteering to help kids in your community. Foster care, Boys and Girls Clubs, clothing banks, shelters, food banks, literacy programs via libraries, children's hospitals. You will be amazed at how much better you feel.

            FBI Anon says that that is all that we should focus on and do. We dig until we can start raising questions, and then force people to answer. We don't have to rescue anybody. We don't have to prosecute them in court. We don't have to report anybody to the police.
           </p>
           <p>
            The good guys have the information, but they can't act on it. We can do stuff, but we don't have the information. The good thing about us is that we can continue to dig.

            I know exactly what you mean, everything except for this has taken a back burner. I feel like this is the event I was born for, like I was meant to be here at this time, in adulthood to contribute to the good fight. My whole life I have been successful in my work, but never satisfied, mostly because corruption runs deep and I get so far, and I can't go any farther because of what I have to do in order to keep my job. I can't get behind corruption, but this fight is something I can get behind 1000%. So help me God, I'll fight this fight right to the end!

            The feeling you described is exactly how I felt as soon as the Podesta e-mails started dropping on WikiLeaks. Totally fucked up my sleeping schedule and wrecked me until the day of the election. Strangely Pizzagate has had a very calming effect on me. I've known about the pedophiles in Washington and the thelemetic occult practices for years so I'm actually kind of relieved that this is all finally coming out in the open.

            I don't want to preach at anyone I hope you don't take anything I say that was but I have had both a legal career and worked as a therapist. I want to assure you that you are not crazy that there is a reason everyone is attempting to silence you. There is many implicated. It looks like they are trying to buy some time until a power change happens. We are in a spiritual battle maybe as never before. God said he would expose all things hidden in the dark.As hard as it is too see the very fact that You are one of the ones no longer blinded will help you through this. Be on the right side of History this might be the last chance you have to do it.

            I hope I have something to offer here.
           </p>
           <p>
            First of all I think it is important for everyone to realize that all of us on voat at least have suffered to some degree a trauma.  There is a psychological term I don't have for those who empathize with traumatized people, like a secondary trauma.  We have all seen and in some way understood the absolute soul tearing trauma that has been unleashed on those most unable to bear it - innocent open souls.  And then the ongoing grimy survival of those children trafficked and continually used and raped.  This is literally a raping of our young, and it is a human instinct to immediately protect our young.
           </p>
           <p>
            So after getting initially traumatized we also realize we cannot really tell many or any one about it - we are literally in a shadow way experiencing some of what the vitims we empathize with have experienced.  A shattered word where  things appear one way, but actually are another way, and you cannot talk about it openly.   You may not be able to speak about it with those closes to you.  This causes an inversion to self, depression, a lot of soul searching, tears and eventually scarring.
           </p>
           <p>
            I feel that it is important to acknowledge that we are going through this in a group level way, and this is a great thread to discuss and share.   And after time you are able to research, write and even talk about things you never thought you could before.   Because there are victims out there right now, probably in cages, some of them bleeding, maybe some of them about to get raped.  And we are going to do everything and anything we can to limit how many of those victims may still be in line for these atrocities.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are literally witnessing a kind of holocause of our own young.   It was always hard to understand how the Nazi's victims lined up to go to the camp that killed them.  But maybe they just didn't believe it could be true.  We can kind of understand that now.   But we are ahead of it and we can still each do something about it.
           </p>

            The Holidays - are going to be very important.  Whoever you may be able to speak to - 1 trusted friend, or 1 trusted relative.   Your mother or whoever.  Tell one person fully who is a skeptic but who trusts you.   Over these holidays the amount of information that is going to be exchanged face to face is more than it has ever been.  Many people have put off looking into this until they have more time on the holidays.  Help and encourage them.   If you have been depressed and hurt remember that is our strenth - being human.  It is ultimately our humanity that is going to give us a chance to beat inhumanity this time.  We have a head start, we have a warning and they are not all powerful and don't let anyone tell you they are.  They are cowards that feed on victimhood, which ultimately makes them weak.
           </p>
           <p>
            Be strong, heal yourself, love your humanity, and when you are ready, fight any way, big or small, for those children.

            i have felt the same way. Detached, despondent, etc... i've never in my life felt what i felt when i found out on november 23rd...
           </p>
           <p>
            i kept seeing people mention pizzagate, with strange quips mentioned... and i was just like WTF is pizzagate ?? who cares about pizza ?
i kept seeing it in comment sections here and there... not consistently but just enough to remind me ' oh yeah i need to search what is pizzagate ' maybe i'll do that when i clear my youtube video log...  the thing is i had already heard about the spiritcooking but was disinterested
as i understand these people do this as "entertainment" or "culture" the same way shopping at whole foods, and eating organic is a trend. Rich people have too much money to throw away so a trendy lil ritual neatly packaged as " art " is not so much of a concern of mine.
           </p>
           <p>
            i still am not convinced they GENUINELY believe this stuff is real, Well aside from Abramovic...  so i had no idea that spirit cooking  and pizzagate were related... i was thinking pizzagate was mainly something dumb like a pizzachain that had systematically abused employees/tax payers ALA Wal-Mart, nothing new in the world of capitalism.
           </p>
           <p>
            well nothing could have prepared me for what i found out watching those Youtube videos... and after seeing 3 hours of them, i understood
the gravity of what this all means, its like the veil had been lifted and the weight of the world was on my shoulders... you cannot unsee the
terrors our government hides... i can believe in the systematic corruption, and i can even live with that, as long as i play by the rules
i'll never be a target or a victim... but to know that thousands of children have been abducted around the world, and in the name of AMERICA.
 And these people, represent us... its just too much... so yeah i feel you, there have been days where i just felt like i could no longer maintain...
           </p>
           <p>
            but luckily they are on the back foot and every fuck up they make we can push back more and more, until they fall.
           </p>
           <p>
            yes... i agree with you, and i am right there too, unable to focus... on my life... simple things... knowing this is going on... =(

 people just oblivious to this even happening... i don't feel guilty that i never knew, i feel guilty knowing and seeing the MSM being aware and willfully deceiving the public... its like watching a football game where the coach is a fuck up calling bad play after bad play...  its like WHAT THE FUCK are you DOING OUT THERE !? are you fucking serious!? You're down by 6 in the 4th quarter with 15 min on the clock, you RUN the Ball on the 4th Down, not punt you idiot, do you want to fight your way back up the field again!?
            </p>
            <p>

" Fake news "  23 results in the Headlines, EVERY article " FAKE NEWS " --- so fucking blatant... its like Gee are the american public THAT retarded they have to be told the shit is FAKE ??
            </p>
            <p>
             Do people not understand you are either on the SIDE OF TRUTH, or the SIDE OF PROTECTING PEDOPHILES...
they are not even mutually exclusive, Either! there could honestly not be a pedophile ring, it could just end at the podestas
and they are the only ones implicated in this thing,  but we will never know as long as MSM sits with there thumbs up their ass
"FAKE NEWS why even look??" this shit is PUBLIC, you can share the images, you can read the tweets and blog posts.
            </p>
            <p>
             instead lets sweep it all out of the way and Censor the Greatest advancement in human communication.

             HOW LONG OF A FUCKING HEADSTART do we give these Fucks ?? they've had Over a fucking month to clean up the joint...
o look not a drop of blood. These guys are Smart, they aren't carving people up in Comet Ping Pong, or Bucks. its all Innuendo
of course they take you offsite to where the real action is... we will never know, cause they have initiated Code Black, by now
and nuked the whole thing from the inside.
            </p>
            <p>
             I want EVERY Motherfucker who called this shit fake to issue an apology when these people are brought to justice.
They should be Round up, stripped naked, Hosed down, put in a Glass cage, in public while we hurl rotten fruit at the box.
publicly jeered and derided for protecting the child rapists.
            </p>
            <p>
             they Really Deserve to be Shamed, play the footage of them LAUGHING at the Thought of these children who are taken
from their homelands, Shipped in a box, Tortured, Dismembered, having their arms and legs amputated. raped repeatedly,
calmed down by some mother lady told they will be set free soon, only to be tortured and raped some more. These are nothing
more than disposable children that are done away with like tissue. the thought of all of that, is what these Media Clowns are
Dismissing and just HA HA laughing at how Absurd anyone could think Any of our Great statesmen are capable of such a thing,
preposterous!!!   Well lets get a Montauge of that combined with the footage of " giant pedo ring busted " - ha ha ha
whos the fucking joke now ?
            </p>
            <p>
             i get hate comments on youtube, for posting contrary to MSM's narrative of this just all being FAKE NEWS.

            As completely lame as this sounds.... the recent trend of 'adult coloring books' is a legitimately great way to calm your mind and relax. There's actually a lot of psychological studies that shows coloring to be very beneficial and therapeutic.

           <p>
            Another thing to do - is there any video games you enjoy playing? I've been a longtime avid LoL player, and I find that playing a few matches is a great way to take my mind off of things as I'm focused on the game at that moment and it really helps to clear my head.

            This. It's really disturbing to know that these innocent children are being held captive in underground facilities, sexually abused, and murdered, and that although the truth is out there people have decided to close their eyes, ignore it, and even joke about it to exorcize the idea that this could be true. Our society makes me feel like throwing up.
           </p>
           <p>
            At a personal level, there is this sense of urge to get them out of there, that makes it feel cynical and unethical to focus on anything else until these children are out and safe. And at the same time, the obstacle that's standing on the way is simply mind boggingly overwhelming: the most fierce, powerful and merciless enemy in the world and in the entire history, an enemy entire countries can't stand up against, and enemy that's virtually controlling the entire planet: the US government. And as things unfold we get to realise that this government is even more powerful, global, and morally bankrupt than we realised, and backed and supported in their action by the entire global elite. Taking them down is going to be a slow and painful process.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's disheartening to know these children are there and will probably all be dead and replaced by another batch of innocent children by the time we finally manage to overcome the censorship and propaganda and create enough social unrest to force the FBI to start an investigation. But if we burnout in the process of trying to get the truth out, the whole effort will fail. We have to accept that this will be a slow process, accept that we may arrive too late to save some of these children, and keep pushing relentlessly anyway, one clue at a time, one convert at a time, to prevent even more children from being abused.
           </p>
           <p>
            The saddest thing in this story is that the strongest resistance is the general's public naivety, complacence, and intellectual laziness. Our self-centered, materialistic way of life where justice, civil responsibility and community have become secondary concerns is the real cause that allowed the globalists to take away our liberties and undermine our very soul while we were not paying attention. We are responsible for the situation.  Society in its entirety needs to be rebooted. I feel so sick about our society that I start to question why I bother contributing to it. Why work hard, why pay my taxes, why try to be successful if that means that by doing some, I'm just playing the game of the globalists?

            I just signed up a couple hours ago to post something I found on youtube,  and I wanted to comment.  First I want to say that everyone who is doing the detective work on here is doing an amazing job!  I  don't think I'll have much to offer, but I want to say thank you and that I feel a little safer knowing that you're here working for the greater good. It truly is good vs. evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            I found out about this when the leaks were coming out and it has changed me inside. It has changed the way  I see the world and myself and my children. How I want to be close to God. I shared about it on fb because I  felt it was my duty as a human being and I believe everyone  thinks I'm crazy. I barely go on there now. I had a big fight with my brother  on thanksgiving because he doesn't believe it and well he wouldn't  even listen to  what I had to say. He was screaming at me. I'm not putting up with that.
           </p>
           <p>
            So it was nice to see this post because I  feel like I'm amongst people who are like minded. If I find anything I think would be helpful, I'll share it, but I will mostly be reading and voting.

            This information, and the consequences which have occurred, have confirmed a gut instinct. This is a historical meme which is spreading out into human consciousness. Which has now been rationalised. It will have consequences . 
In the new paradigm, I am aware that Organised Criminal elements have moved into the established government, and have hijacked what democracy we thought their was. They have done this by taking over the security organisations, and then the politicians by using their moral frailty. Once this was achieved they then orchestrated the whole game. Its no coincidence that as this takeover had occurred we got poorer financially. Along with less freedoms. Then finally became powerless. Now we know why.

            You are coming out of a brain washing. If you can read articles on how to deal with that then that may help. 
It gets better over time. The first 2 weeks are the worst where you don't feel like eating and stuff like that.

            I know how you feel, I've been the same. Hardly been sleeping either. And the worst thing is, none of my friends or family have paid it any attention, they're just carrying on with life as normal, and when I talk to them about it they just think I'm crazy, or getting 'too involved' or just don't really care, or desperately don't want to know in an almost angry way, like they can't cope with knowing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I find myself really wishing that all the people investigating this were my friends and that we were all in a big house somewhere with comfy chairs and beanbags and cookies and coffee, researching and chatting and keeping each other's spirits up.

            You are suffering PTSD.  I felt it years ago when I found this out, it went on for months..longer.  I can only share what I know. Unfortunately for who I was, what used to matter to me  allot means little now. My eyes have opened more over the years, and  the pain I feel is still there, more of a mourning now.   I am sad that this is the world we let happen, it has been going on for a long time.  I am glad that it looks like many people are awake enough now and ready to face it head on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just be aware to look for a real positive, find something that is totally in the polar opposite of this material.
           </p>
           <p>
            Read on research that can help heal the trauma the children who survive this abuse can recuperate from.  I will be useful to help recover from the PTSD you are feeling as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Waking the Tiger: Healing Trauma   is very good information, and I would pass on the knowledge from the book do a web search on it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Man's Search for Meaning was a book I came across that helped allot as well.

            The sad truth: I know people are doing their best to give advice on self care ,but honestly the best thing is being able to discuss it with your co-workers who understand. This adive is from working on cases like this for 22 years. In fact I mentioned this to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Metalica">
             @Metalica
            </a>
            ,one of the mods here. You need people who are able to support you ,that have experience in what you are going through.
I knew this would take a toll , and it will not get easier. I suggest that you make another forum where you can support each other before burn out or worse happens. You can take it or leave it but I know what I am talking about. You need to do this but not on the pizzagate forums.
Good Luck.

            I tried talking to people about it, but everyone I know irl including a therapist I saw thinks I'm a nutcase when I start trying to explain this shit. This is one of the few places I know where people are aware and talking about it won't fall on deaf ears. If you haven't noticed a lot of people in this thread feel the same way, and I'm not just complaining, I'm asking advice.

            I can relate brother. All I can say is remember to take care of your life first. There isn't much you can do about all of this as a single entity. Not to get down on those who have put in their efforts to expose this. But make sure your taking care of yourself first.

            I was despondent for a while over this, but finding this community has made me feel not so helpless anymore. It will be an uphill battle, but at least we have comrades. There are more "awake" people than I previously thought, which is also encouraging.

            I discovered it last Saturday and everything happening around me feels so irrelevant after putting together all the pieces. Went through some of the older archives from stuff that happened the 20th century and it's taken me even further down this rabbit hole. I cant believe these sick sick people have control over the majority of the worlds population for so long.

            Dude, I'm a grown man twice your age and it's disturbed me since I first read Podesta's sickening emails.  It was like Sandusky/PSU Football pedo ring all over again, but nightmarishly more evil.

             Here in the UK a "historical" scandal similar to Sandusky  is big news....whenever the heat is on they throw a few crumbs from their feeder channels into the mix to distract people from the roots of this evil....but more and more people are asking the obvious questions.....next year will be interesting if we make it that far

              Interesting.  Once Sandusky became the red herring, attracting all media attention as well as the legions of Penn State University football fanatics, interest in the Second Mile Foundation dissolved completely.  Clearly the Foundation existed as a logistical operation, with tentacles all over the eastern and midwestern U.S. and yet it was allowed to slip off unexamined.
             </p>
             <p>
              This adds to the suspicion of pedos operating in key positions of government authority and as media gatekeepers.

            I must admit pizzagate is such a compelling and all consuming investigation. Once you take a look at the rabbit hole, it is never ending. The details are so incredible even George R.R Martin could not make it up. In a way, Pizzagate has given many of us a real purpose to use our brain power and see what cinformation we can uncover. Being part of pizzagate has sharpened my detective skills. I also started watching crime dramas to see what methods they use.

             I think that it helps to be honest about your own bad behaviour. When I look at my past evil, I can compare it to how these villains do stuff. It's easier for me to say, "I'd never do that. That's funny.".
            </p>
            <p>
             For Pizzagate, it's helped me to also look at it from a business point of view. These villains probably think of these poor victims as "products".

            Unless your children or immediate family were harmed by this scandal, you need to detach. There have been bad things going on in the world forever and you alone are not going to solve this. Detach and bring back some productive energy when you have taken care of yourself.

            Its normal to be bummed out about this crap... i stopped looking at it over the years because it is depressing, but... im actually very happy it has been exposed to this point, this is the first time in history that this crap has relly seen the light of day to this extent.  More people are awake now than ever. Just like in the movie "vampires", we will drag them into the light one by one kicking and screaming  as they incinerate. :)

            Yes....I am taking fucking Soma...or Xanax to get to sleep at night...each night for about two weeks....I havent watched any tv......just contantly update this site.   Try to link the best stuff on the internet to my FB account.   But for actually searching and helping I have limited computer skills.

             As I mentioned above, you will accommodate to this, to a certain degree, the better to prevail.  Think of soldiers you know, the combat vets.  I grew up with Vietnam and WWII guys ... the "thousand yard stare" is real.  It gets you through sights and sounds and smells we were never intended to experience.  This too shall pass -- and then may God visit justice on the guilty.

            It's been rough...I've felt the same way. But it gets better. Try to take a break. Try to remember that we're making progress. Also, there's always the chance that the fbi has more info than we think, and they're just waiting for Trump to get into office. I know it's not safe to trust Trump, but it's a possibility! Hang in there comrade. Take care of yourself!

             You should read all of the information shared by FBIAnon. We can never know for sure that he was a real FBI guy, but a lot of what he said made sense.
            </p>
            <p>
             He says that they have enough information to bring everybody to justice, but the problem is that the corruption has tied their hands. We just have to find the information out there which is easy to find. He kept emphasizing that we should focus on the Clinton Foundation, and then start raising questions until nobody could ignore us any more. He said that Pizzagate in Washington DC is really small compared to the Clinton Foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
             After reading the evidence that we have so far, I'm starting to agree. I think that we can start to ignore Instagram and James A. There is just so much more solid information available for the Clinton Foundation and so on.

             I agree with all the posts, and especially, OP, you have to take a break from it once in awhile!  It CAN be very discouraging, when the MSM blows it off, and we hear about people like Monica Petersen, etc.  Sometimes it it hard to tell we are making a difference.  Especially, like on twitter, one reason I'm leaving there, is I sometimes have to check that my retweets are even getting posted.  All of a sudden I went from getting a lot of likes of my tweets to barely any a day.  And I see and hear them messing with twitter, and YT videos, so that's very discouraging.  I guess the main thing I would say, is since PG is so huge, and shills are getting paid by billionaires to keep it all on the down lo, that you HAVE to set aside a time for doing this; and don't let it consume your whole life.
             <br/>
             Edit:  Also, I hae to say that I will never be able to get that image out of my head, of the little girl taped to the table.  There is just NO innocent or GOOD reason for that to have been done, OR the picture to have been taken!  So there are days I wish I hadn't found out about PG.  But I did.  And part of me is praying that someone IS looking out for her and all the innocent victims of these sickos, and that by some miracle, Trump WILL not blow us off like the MSM has done.

            Dont doubt the story, you know its real, so does everyone here... ive known this for over 20 years now. Having doubts is exactly what THEY want you to do.  Sowing the seeds of doubt is how they have gotten away with this for so long. I am 100% sure of this and i dont care how stupid i sound, i dont lecture people, i just drop it into a sentence here and there.

            I went from moderately left oriented to moderate right over the last week or so.  Reality kicks in. Things make sense now. Can't really blame the people who are unaware.. but there is a definite "before" and "after", and I spend almost every hour I can on the topic, actively or consciously, considering the historic significance of the crimes: in modern times, they are on par with the worse in the book. CIA is an enemy of humanity,

             Left and right are now a false dichotomy....two cheeks of the same arse....
            </p>
            <p>
             The sides we need to pick are...
Freedom vs slavery
Libertarianism vs authoritarianism
Life vs death
Love vs hate
Good vs evil

              This is the thing: I really understand. "Some of those that work force are the same that burn crosses"
If trump gets killed (possibly in a false flag, he can go to Mars faik), chaos erupts, no culprit is found, riots, clashes, bloodbaths. The military has more force which is the last ditch resort, and in the end the deciding factor on the road to re-install society. People on the losing end call for foreign aid. See who responds. Maybe some militant muslims. Maybe russia is like heck I'll let you kill yourselves off. Something tells me things will be in control sooner rather than later, there is a chance this is in the planning to an extent that this protocol can be executed, starting with curfew and escalation from there. Maybe the leak was a weapon of mass destruction, a plant with the intention to tear society apart. No more freedom.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why does this matter? War is a buffer for child exploitation, right? Yes. so would foreign powers want to intervene? Not at the risk of escalating it to an international nuclear war, which in turn can escalate to the apocalypse. Besides the fact that this can also easily be staged by the CIA if they wanted. Just point a finger to a scapegoat with false claims, bombs away.
             </p>
             <p>
              Let's assume that in every possible scenario, the abuse can continue.
             </p>
             <p>
              The destruction of society would make things worse, the reduction of mankind to a mere handful of survivors would effectively solve the scandal. Small groups of people can still do awful things, but it'll be far less likely to last long if those people decide to live like animals. Remaining civilians who aren't complete barbaric might also have a hand in cleaning up this kind of filth that is the last reminder of the failure that is planet earth.

              Sorry for what I've said, I am fully aware how insane this sounds. I just realize that we can't win. We just can't. Awareness creates disobedience, which is when the authoritarians can oppress the people. The problem is global. This is the new world order, A side effect of a psychopathic machine making the world turn.

              I;m sure I had at least one proactive thought this week, don't worry.

              I keep wondering what the hell was FBIanon thinking. Maybe realized how hopeless this is?

             Same exact political dispositions as you. It's definitely a singular 'oh shit' moment when it all clicks. I still think the left has a point about being charitable to those less fortunate, but once you see the whole picture you just see leaders manipulating them with their good intentions.
            </p>
            <p>
             And yeah, seriously, fuck the CIA. At least ISIS and actual terrorists are up-front and declare the fact that they are enemies to the American people, which I honestly respect more than being a fucking snake in grass and rotting the foundation of our institutions through corruption.

              I don't think left and right mean anything anymore. It's obvious now that the people in power are mainly the same, and that it's really us and them, and that is the ONLY dichotomy left. All these stupid wars and racism and left vs right and being afraid of immigrants or Muslims or whatever, it's all just their way to keep us from recognising our true enemy, to keep us from realising that actually we have infinitely more in common with all the other ordinary people in the world, whatever their race, religion, nationality, culture, political beliefs, gender etc, than we do with any of the people in power. We only fight wars because they made us believe it was righteous to turn against our brothers and sisters as though THEY were the ones threatening our lives, our peace, our freedom. But now we know that the menace was always the monsters above, who have been profiting from our deaths and violence, and laughing at our futile suffering.

            You may be fascinated by a book written about this back in the late 1800s called "The Great Controversey". I am willing to buy you a copy if you have interest. I can honestly say, it has brought me a load of peace in light of everything that is going on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Originally, I was able to get my hands on an
            <strong>
             expensive
            </strong>
            vintage copy from 1911 to add to my collection, but it was only for the sake of my collection.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, I was also able to track down a reprint for
            <strong>
             only $4.00
            </strong>
            for you

            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Or, if you want the audiobook, or digital version for your device, you can get it within an app that has all of the author's writings for
            <strong>
             totally free
            </strong>

           </p>
           <p>
            I enjoyed listening to the audiobook version on my daily commute to work. If you end up making it through the book someday, I would love to hear from you! This book is by far my favorite book of all time. I promise if you can make it from the beginning to the end oif the book while connecting the dots, you will have eyesight not only on the time we are in, but exactly what to expect in the time ahead. And this insight will help you be able to proceed with confidence and peace if applied correctly. This book helped me to be able to be keenly aware of the stuff going on behind the scenes, while helping give me love for my life! I love being alive now, despite the chaos all around. Yeah the book is my favorite!

            Edit:
            <strong>
             TLDR
            </strong>
            : If you are interested, I will purchase a copy of my favorite book for you, or anyone else who reads this and wants a copy! We need to look out for each other.

             Are you the good kind of shill?
I missed the days when I thought all shills did was plug products and mess up Amazon reviews.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks for the recommendation, and the gesture you don't have to buy me a copy. I'll check it out over a break.

              Haha the good ole' days. Yeah, I'm actually looking for excuses to buy people this book. I keep my eyes open for opportunities. Like at the end of the day, I think it's something simple that really blessed my life, and I want to pass it on :)
             </p>
             <p>
              Yeah! Reading the book was quite a journey, it weaved back and fourth through time painting a picture of past, present, and future in terms of the crazy stuff that is unfolding all around us, and historical recollections of things that have already happened. I got super stoked when I got to the end, though because the author painted a clear path for the days ahead. This book was such a blessing that I am now thinking of designing some special edition cloth-bound reprints that I can maybe save up enough money to get published in large quantity so that I can just send them straight to people. For real though, I will buy copies for anybody who will let me.

             Agree it is a spiritual battle. Since prior to the election when #spiritcooking started and then the pizza code words... it has been all encompassing and one sees that it is worldwide and has been happening from centuries ago with the child sacrifices to Moloch to now in the shadows of powerful elites.
            </p>
            <p>
             Praying that all of you are protected spiritually - put on the Armor of God... being part of 1000's researching is an honor.

               We have to keep in mind that we have already ultimately won by Christ's death on a cross. When evil is so blatantly upon us it makes the contrast of good vs. evil more clear than ever. These evil people, with all their power and devious ways are actually terrified of the Cross. It's their true weakness and they can't ultimately win, that battle was played out over 2000 years ago.

             It definitely feels like an epic spiritual battle between good and evil.   Ephesians 6:12
For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.

              Read Ezekiel 28. It's addressed to the King of Tyre but the passage describes things that couldn't possibly be related to a human king.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               You were in Eden,
    the garden of God;
              </p>
              <p>
               You were anointed as a guardian cherub,
    for so I ordained you.
              </p>
              <p>
               Your heart became proud
    on account of your beauty,
and you corrupted your wisdom
    because of your splendor.
So I threw you to the earth;
    I made a spectacle of you before kings.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              I think this chapter demonstrates the reality that demonic/satanic forces traffic in the halls of government and power through people.

              This scripture describes almost exactly what we are dealing with; a secret group that has infiltrated the government and commits secret murders and abominations and protects each other from justice:
             </p>
             <p>
              " 22 And it came to pass that they did have their signs, yea, their secret signs, and their secret words; and this that they might distinguish a brother who had entered into the covenant, that whatsoever wickedness his brother should do he should not be injured by his brother, nor by those who did belong to his band, who had taken this covenant.
             </p>
             <p>
              23 And thus they might murder, and plunder, and steal, and commit whoredoms and all manner of wickedness, contrary to the laws of their country and also the laws of their God."
             </p>
             <p>
              " 30 And behold, it is he who is the author of all sin. And behold, he doth carry on his works of darkness and secret murder, and doth hand down their plots, and their oaths, and their covenants, and their plans of awful wickedness, from generation to generation according as he can get hold upon the hearts of the children of men."
             </p>

               Wow that sounds like it is talking about the ancestors of the people we're dealing with - it seems like the whole cult/paedo thing is passed down through generations from what I've been reading.

              As sad as this is, it is comforting to know that those involved are feeling this way. I feel like I will never let this go until this shit ends. Once someone has seen the things we have seen.. it just changes a person. I'm someone who almost voted for Hillary. In retrospect, the only reason I thought Hillary over Trump was because the media spent no time at all talking about the specifics of her scandals and I was too busy to dig through them myself. I found out about pizzagate AFTER the election from some random comment on reddit mentioning it. Witnessing first hand the cover up that took place.. and continues to take place.... it makes me look at thing so much more critically than before. I've never been fed such a big lie. Shit changes you man. Keep spreading.

               Thank you for not voting for her. I won't tell you that Trump is the best, but I do think that he was the person, who needed your votes. Even if he turns out to be the same, then we still had a chance coalesce around a different kind of leader, and it proved that a broad cross section of people didn't have to put up with the same standard lies any more. I think that society will be more open minded now.
              </p>
              <p>
               An interesting note is that Trump isn't a classic Republican conservative, in my opinion. Therefore, when the conservative community supported him, they essentially elected a third party.
              </p>
              <p>
               Yeah, I never heard of Pizzagate until that Wikileaks AMA. Somebody asked an innocent question, and then the interviewees expressed that they had no clue on the matter.

               I used to practice/dabble in the occult, Luciferianism and Gnosticism.
              </p>
              <p>
               Everything I've studied, all of the countless books and manuscripts I've read...NONE have ever mentioned any of this.  It's a shadow realm of magick and depravity that I never wanted to be thrown into.  I thought these were fairy tales!  Dark, twisted whispers that 'Christians' utter to smear the reputation of the sinners.  How wrong was I?  Now I find myself questioning everything....all of it.  Every 'belief' I thought I had was never grounded or solidified...it' is now sitting there, mocking my insecurity.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's almost like a Cabin the Woods scenario.  You know destroying the house will unleash the beast and you will die, but you also know that people are being sacrificed to keep the house standing (and the rest of the world).  Which scenario is better?   You both die.
              </p>
              <p>
               I say take the higher road.  We all die fairly, and the torture stops.  Everything stops.

               why oh why would you call this beautiful singer 1) a witch  2) into the same stuff?  this is wrong.  This is classic guilt by association but almost everyone who isn't necessarily Christian isn't a Satanic worshiping baby eater.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm genuinel sorry for you and me and everyone who has had terrible things put in their consciencness because of this scandal, but you can't start painting anyone a little different with the label "witch" and assume they do evil things just because your innocence has been shattered.

                I feel you. I know it's hard when you realize your idols are monsters. Take for instance, my favortie song of all time: Carribean blue. Now read the lyrics and tell me you understand all these weird incantations she is singing, all these calls to demons and this narrative about the sky being a sea. Don't you get it by now?

            I dreamed about pizzagate every night for about 2 weeks. I could feel a seismic shift in the universe.

             I try to take comfort in the fact we dont need the majority to win.....we just have to be a really aggressive minority.....very vocal.....very confident.   After a while we cant help but draw attention.

            I got a huge wave of depression today, where I was literally going to leave my family for a week....because all this "other" stuff, insignificant stuff happening around me didn't really matter VS what is really going on (#pizzagate) , which is why I was getting depressed with this. Than I broke down and talked to my significant other, and he helped me come out of it, now back to research. Its messing with everyone.. Stay strong though, keep your loved ones close and make sure to  TALK about it, how you feel,  to your family or husband/wife, GF, BF etc. Were all in this together, don't be scared, don't let it mess you up, this is your consciousness waking up, like a bad hangover, your waking up out of a "coma", we all are, keep calm and lets get these fuckers.

            Yeah I think the first week I totally snapped and wanted to go fuck up the people involved even if it got me killed. Now that I calmed down a little I see how that would be completely counterproductive and fits right into their narrative. It sucks, it's like you're living in a different world once your eyes open. I didn't even care that much about politics before I learned this.

            I've been dreaming about it every night for about 2 weeks. It is quite depressing. Particularly when it feels like the numbers are against you due to this coverup and the general public being totally blind. It's like they are wearing a VR headset and have no idea what's really happening around them.

             That's the way it goes, you know, forever.  It will never change so you might as well get used to it.  People like us were blessed/cursed with a clear-sightedness that means we really do see things others cannot, or cannot see until they are much closer in time and space.  And evil never sleeps, it only changes shapes.

             It's just like they said on the old Superman stories, a never ending struggle for Truth, Justice and the American Way.

            Learn to meditate. If you don't have any activity that can allow your conscious mind drift away from it completely, then I think your best bet is to learn to meditate.

            If you live in or near a city area, look if there are float tanks you can rent out. Sensory deprivation can be very therapeutic.

            For me, I feel like repeated serial exposure to entheogens has prepared me to go down any rabbit hole and know how to let go and not let it effect me. Like the saying "When you stare into the abyss, sometimes the abyss stares back in to you", it is true, these things can destroy you. It is not for everyone to look at the details and associations.

            Oh ffs. Turn off your wifi and get back to school. Limit your time to an hour a day or something reasonable.  This shit has been going on for decades and yes, I am also consumed but I am old and this confirms so many weird things I have heard and seen in my life, its not news so much as confirmation.  So do not compromise your future by fucking up your exams. It will be here when your semester ends.

              I am so sorry, because learning that world is not what you thought really is devastating. But, you still need to live in real life, so try to focus on your immediate tasks at hand. So much of the world is trying to hide it to cover their asses, and it may be that nothing happens (nobody is arrested or held accountable). The internet reveals so much so quickly and there is a darker sense of the future that I don't know how to console you except that  every generation has had to face real challenges threats and fears that seemed like imminent armageddon and yet life goes on and people find and create value in their day to day.

               Yeah, I'll cope in time. Part of me hates the idea of just moving on and doing my own thing because I can imagine the elites just laughing at the few that notice what's happening since people don't believe them and they're powerless to change anything. I'm hoping for a mass awakening soon, but I guess I shouldn't hold my breath.

            It's finals week and I have directed all my attention to this cause. It has taken a toll on me, juggling all this stress. I don't think I have taken a break today either, but I'm extremely dedicated to exposing these sick fucks

            I've been down it since it broke and still no signs of stopping for me. The worst is how others think I'm crazy, I think if people acknowledged this shit is real to me it'd be a huge relief.

             Stop talking about it if the people around you don't want to hear. You probably do sound crazy to them. I know people who claim that there are Portals for aliens to travel through and others who accept the official story on 911, to me they are crazy, but someday I might find out that they are right.

             Yes.  In order to effectively fight a battle, we must maintain our balance.  Balance responsibility with faith.  Balance suspicion with skepticism (to avoid being suckered by disinformation).
            </p>
            <p>
             Spend only a certain amount of time per day on investigating, etc, and think about how to use that time effectively.  Focus only on leads that are backed up with reliable SOURCES.  Ignore fluff and potential disinformation.
