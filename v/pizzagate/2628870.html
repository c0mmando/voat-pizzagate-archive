            An HHS official said those individuals could have been human traffickers and said the results show its screening process is working. The Trump administration is using DNA testing to reunite migrant families previously separated in order to prosecute adults illegally crossing the border.
           </p>
           <p>
            Will there be an investigation into those people suspected of being Human Traffickers?  Especially involving Children?  Something should be done to look into them and Lock Them Up if guilty.  We don't need them stealing anymore Children.

             Those Fakes that are parading themselves as progressives, are far from it.  I and my friends consider ourselves Progressives.  We DO NOT espouse to ANY of what they are preaching and doing.  Some may be sheep, but if they knew the truth, they would want to boil them in oil.  I think both sides have been screwed over by their "political leaders".  They are guilty of stealing billions of our hard earned money and worse yet, Our Children.  Democrats/Progressives are running down to the holding centers and crying for those children while their Rep.  counterparts are sitting back in DC railing about how much they love the children but they are turn coats too  We have been had for decades and I have to say, I am so glad to be alive.  Yes, those poor little children will be the ones to suffer the consequences if things don't turn out right.  We have to remember that we have been fooled many times over, I included.  I am holding my opinion of Trump and hope what he is doing is for the common good, but I also say, God help him, if he is not.
            </p>
            <p>
             I was worried about them using their DNA, worrying about their privacy, but now I see there was a good reason.  But I think it will all go over the heads of those Sheep (some friends included) and those that just hate Mexicans, including their children.  As I said I am glad to be on voat and among those that are Awake.  Yourself included.
