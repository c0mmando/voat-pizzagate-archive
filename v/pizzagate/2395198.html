<p>From article: &quot;The story of the Comey boys and the Ramsey Rapist imparts another lesson, one that has never been fully reported and that James himself may not know. This accompanying lesson began two days after the break-in, when a civilian volunteer who the police would describe as a “woodsman” and tracker set to following the gunman’s trail through the area that the small army of searchers had trampled.</p>
<p>The woodsman was 27-year-old Tom Brown, Jr. and he would later say that he had acquired his expertise from a wandering Apache shaman scout named Stalking Wolf. The tale as told by Brown was that Stalking Wolf had been 20 when “a vision sent him away from his people” and “for the next 63 years he wandered, seeking teachers and learning the old ways of many native peoples” until he encountered “a small boy gathering fossils in a stream bed.” [&quot;Apache&quot; is mentioned two more times in the article]</p>

             He could be the country’s next top crime fighter, overseeing investigations into the most serious threats facing the nation.
            </p>
            <p>
             But James Comey — President Obama’s pick to be the director of the FBI — got an unwelcomed introduction to law and order as a teenager in Allendale more than 35 years ago, during a brief and dangerous brush with a notorious criminal who had all of Bergen County on edge.
            </p>
            <p>
             A man dubbed “the Ramsey rapist” held 15-year-old Comey and his younger brother at gunpoint after breaking into their Allendale home on an October day in 1977, one of a string of break-ins that included the rape of two area baby sitters. The Comey brothers, locked in a bathroom while the intruder searched the home, escaped through a window, only to encounter the man again on their lawn. The brothers ran back inside the house, locked the doors and called police, setting off a massive manhunt.

            </p>
            <p>
             In the decades since that episode, which Comey has said taught him important lessons about crime’s psychological toll on victims, the Northern Highlands Regional High School graduate has earned a reputation as a tough, but ethical, federal prosecutor and a Department of Justice attorney brave enough to stand up to political pressure from the White House.
            </p>
            <p>
             On Thursday, a day after news of his expected nomination to succeed Robert Mueller, he earned praise from Republican Governor Christie, as well as politicians on both sides of the aisle, and former colleagues from his days as a U.S. attorney in Manhattan. And the plaudits were echoed locally, where the Comey family was known as “one of the best families in Allendale,” the mayor of that borough said.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             Comey, 52, who now lives in Connecticut, would need Senate confirmation. He is certain to face tough questions about his work as a counsel for a major hedge fund and his ties to Wall Street as well as how he would handle current, high-profile FBI investigations.
            </p>
            <p>
             But Republicans and Democrats said his strong credentials and sterling reputation suggest his path to confirmation should be relatively smooth. Comey, a Republican who served as a deputy under former Attorney General John Ashcroft, has also been lauded for his refusal to reauthorize the Bush administration’s controversial wiretapping program while he was filling in for Ashcroft, who was in the hospital at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             “Jim Comey was an outstanding U.S. attorney and served as deputy attorney general with distinction,” Christie, a former U.S. attorney for New Jersey, said in a statement on Thursday. “I have never served with anyone with greater integrity or a better sense of the unique obligations and opportunities presented by true public service. The FBI and America would once again be well served by his strong and honest leadership.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Christie, who said he consulted with Comey regularly when they were federal prosecutors, has publicly referred to advice Comey gave him in 2003. Christie said Comey told him: “It’s harder to hate up close.” Christie has said that guidance prompted him to talk to teachers directly to convince them of his controversial ideas on education and pension reforms.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             Comey, who also has private-sector experience that includes serving as general counsel for the military contractor Lockheed Martin and the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, did not return calls seeking comment on Thursday.
            </p>
            <p>
             But his younger brother, Peter Comey, who was in the house with James the day of the home invasion, said he was not surprised by news of the nomination. He said his brother was right for the job.
            </p>
            <p>
             “He has an extremely strong and beneficial moral compass,” said Peter Comey, who is one of four siblings and now lives in Virginia. “He knows right from wrong. And he looks at things in a very circumspect way.”
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2006, Comey, a married father of five children, told a reporter that, although he was not hurt in the home invasion during his childhood, it gave him insight into the psychological pain that victims feel. No one was ever prosecuted for the crime.
            </p>
            <p>
             Allendale Mayor Vince Barra said the Comeys were heavily engaged in the civic duties and were active at Guardian Angel Roman Catholic Church.
            </p>
            <p>
             J. Brien Comey, James’ father, now in his early 80s, still lives in the same home the family moved into in the early 1970s, even though all four of his children live elsewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
             A retired real estate executive, J. Brien Comey was an Allendale councilman in the mid- and late-1980s. His wife, Joan, who died last year after a long illness, was involved in the Girl Scouts and many other local organizations, Barra said.
            </p>
            <p>
             “They were involved in everything from Scouts to the church to ... you name it,” Barra said. “They were a huge part of Allendale. The parents had a strong sense of integrity, they were hardworking, and they believed in public service. That’s where James got it from. The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.”
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             Walter Arsenault, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office who worked with Comey when he was a U.S. attorney in New York, called him “a smart guy, a hard worker whose integrity is beyond reproach.”
            </p>
            <p>
             But Comey is certain to face tough questions from senators about his work as an attorney for Bridgewater Associates.
            </p>
            <p>
             “If he’s nominated, he would have to answer questions about his recent work in the hedge fund industry,” said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee. “The administration’s efforts to criminally prosecute Wall Street for its part in the economic downturn have been abysmal, and his agency would have to help build the case against some of his colleagues in this lucrative industry.”
            </p>
            <p>
             If confirmed, Comey would serve a 10-year tenure overseeing an organization responsible for both intelligence and law enforcement with more than 36,000 employees.
            </p>
            <p>
             Comey would be coming into the FBI at a critical time, with the agency conducting a politically sensitive investigation of the Internal Revenue Service and an investigation of the Boston Marathon bombings, which have raised some doubts about the FBI’s ability to prevent terrorist attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition, it is the FBI that is carrying out the Justice Department’s aggressive use of subpoenas and in at least one instance, a search warrant, to gather the phone records and emails of some journalists. The aggressive stance has triggered an outcry from the news media and members of Congress from both parties.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             The Obama administration’s actions in the war on terror have drawn scrutiny in Congress as well and are likely to be raised at any confirmation hearing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Comey became a hero to Democrats for the central role he played in holding up Bush’s warrantless wiretapping program, one of the administration’s great controversies and an episode that focused attention on the administration’s controversial tactics in the war against terrorism.
            </p>
            <p>
             In dramatic testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2007, Comey said he thought Bush’s no-warrant wiretapping program was so questionable that he refused for a time to reauthorize it, leading to a standoff with White House officials at the hospital bedside of an ailing Ashcroft.
            </p>
            <p>
             Comey said he refused to recertify the program because Ashcroft had reservations about its legality.
            </p>
            <p>
             Comey was deputy attorney general in 2005 when he unsuccessfully tried to limit tough interrogation tactics against suspected terrorists.
            </p>
            <p>
             He told then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales that some of the practices were wrong and would damage the department’s reputation.

            Let me throw out a random question: why is it Voat has remained largely un-cited as a resource in any major social media?  Posobiec, Cernovich, InfoWars, etc...
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as thinking, debating and sourcing out topics of the nastiest kind, stuff people won't believe.  Why isn't this community growing?  If anything, it seems to be slowing down.  (Intentionally buried sub sub)

             <p>
              Fayetteville, N.C. — Detectives with the Fayetteville Police Department are working to identify a suspect who is believed to be tied to six rape cases from 2006 to 2008.
             </p>
             <p>
              The rapes, all unsolved, occurred near North Fayetteville Street and Ramsey Street between March 2006 and January 2008. Consistent DNA at crime scenes led police to believe that one man, known as the “Ramsey Street Rapist,” is responsible for all six cases.
             </p>
             <p>
              Victims described the suspect as a thin to average build white man in his late 20s to mid 40s who stands five feet nine inches tall to six feet three inches tall and weighs anywhere from 165 to 230 pounds. He is believed to have short black or dark brown hair, some sort of facial hair -- either a goatee or mustache -- and a southern accent.
             </p>
             <p>
              Victims said he had musky breath and body odor and that he smelled of machinery oil. He wore various hoodie-type shirts during five of the six rapes, including a dark-colored pull-over hooded style sweatshirt with the Orange County Choppers logo on the front and a navy blue or dark green hooded sweatshirt with "Notre Dame" written across the chest.
             </p>
             <p>
              Using the DNA, several composite sketches were created in attempt to identify and locate the suspect. "The composites are with and without facial hair and age-progressed to what the suspect may look like today," detectives said.
             </p>
             <p>
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyone who recognizes the description or photo or anyone with information concerning this sexual assault investigation is asked to contact Lieutenant John Somerindyke with the Fayetteville Police Department at 910-433-1851 or Crime Stoppers at 910-483-8477.
             </p>
             <p>
              The investigation is part of the Fayetteville Police Department's effort to solve several cold case sexual assault investigations in recognition of April being Sexual Assault Awareness Month. So far, the department has solved 21 cases in the last two years.

             Tom Brown, Jr.

            actually led police to arrest and hold in custody, Bruce Ader, Sr. just
            <strong>
             "Three nights before Halloween and nine days before Election Day in 1977"
            </strong>
            -- bail was set at $250,000; with Bruce accused of being the gunman involved with the break in at the Comey house &amp; due to that, accused of being the Ramsey Rapist.
           </p>
           <p>
            No evidence would ever surface to prove these allegations, indeed, Bruce's multiple alibis, a lack of anything remotely incriminating being found from searches of his property and discrepancies between witness accounts(even one of the Comey brothers did not ID Alder in a lineup, while the other did), were key factors in the allegations being dropped in February 1978 -- not before Bruce's bail was lowered to $12,000 "The day after Election Day", though.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The youngest rape victim said she was too frightened to view a line-up on November 7, but the other two agreed. Neither picked out Bruce, Sr.. Nor did the family across the street from the Comey home. One of the Comey boys – it is not clear which – did pick out Bruce, Sr.. The other did not.
            </p>
            <p>
             The police searched the Ader home, but found no gun or anything else incriminating. Bruce, Sr. agreed to submit a hair, saliva and blood samples. There was no match with any recovered from the crime scenes.
            </p>
            <p>
             The day after Election Day, a judge agreed to reduce Bruce, Sr.’s bail to $12,000. A Newark police detective who believed in his innocence posted his own property as collateral. The Bergen County prosecutor, Roger Breslin — who reportedly was not consulted by the police before they made the arrest — expressed little confidence in the case.
            </p>
            <p>
             “At the moment, there are no viable rape charges against him,” Breslin told reporters.

             “Nobody was ever charged” for either the home invasion or the rapes, Breslin told the Daily Beast last week.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             By various news accounts, Brown determined that the trail emerged from the trees in the vicinity of a house owned by a man named Steve Ader. The man happened to be the brother of Bruce Ader, Sr., a 39-year-old bulldozer operator who lived in Bernardsville but was helping to clear a road in Allendale two miles from the Comey home. Somebody who had seen Bruce, Sr. on the job had apparently decided that he matched the sketch and the accompanying description of the gunman.

            I would like to know about all the other cases of this Ramsey Rapist.  I think from what I remember, the Comey parents were well respected members of the community.  The father held some office in town and the mother was socially connected with organizations, etc.  I never did trust them, don't know why, but I have always felt there was something odd about the story.  Were the Comey boys sold off?  Were they really raped and the Ramsey Rapist story was a fluke and a Good Cover Story?  IDK, but this story Still Reeks, imo.
