            Look at Carey's dead eyes and disdainful expression. How is "Church of England"--a church invented by an excommunicated Latin Catholic, a syphilitic madman, a king who looted churches monasteries, and the graves of saints, even considered a legitimate church?
their founder, not Christ nor the Holy Spirit, but who was so "Christian": how many people did he burn at the stake? How many wives murdered/divorced/annulled?
