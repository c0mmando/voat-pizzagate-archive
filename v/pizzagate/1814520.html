<blockquote>
<p>Beneath the surface of the political organization, BAMN (By Any Means Necessary) is an organization of human traffickers, who groom and eventually coerce young teens to run away from their parents. 
BAMN has convinced children as young as fourteen to run away from home (secretsurvivorsofbamn.wordpress.com), and are often provided transportation out of state to a BAMN safehouse.
Children at the safehouse are either sold on the black market or used as political fodder when the child reaches the age of sixteen or seventeen (depending on state). 
The proceeds from the sale of underage children on the black market goes towards partially towards funding the organization and the rest goes into the BAMN house leader\'s pockets. 
If the child has not been trafficked by the age of emancipation, the organization will have the child legally emancipated from their parents if they have not already sold them.
The children who are not sold are transported again, placed into the home of a BAMN leader, who will use them as political fodder at left wing rallies.
According to BAMN survivors, they are not allowed to contact their friends, family, or go back home. 
BAMN may be related to many human trafficking cases, as well as emotional, sexual, and physical abuse of teens throughout the country. 
Their main network of kidnapping teens is primarily set up in Detroit, MI; however, they have begun to develop networks in other major cities including. 
Do not let these people continue to conduct their human trafficking of teens under the guise of a political movement; urge the FBI to investigate BAMN.</p>

            Back in grad school I knew one of these BLM protesters and a girl who was an antifa protester. Being in classes with her was the first I ever heard of antifa. The BLM guy was from a nice, well-off family and he traveled all over to insert himself in the BLM protests. Always front and center in news articles about it, like he'd suffered oppression (he didn't). He would also accuse us all of being racist at least once during every class. Seriously. The girl was very nice, but mysterious about what she was doing with the protesting, and she frequently brought up a history of being homeless and being raped. She was always having people stay at her apartment and the people looked like extras from a Charles Dickens movie- like dressing ridiculous in top hats and rags and filthy with the rotten teeth. She'd take them around campus and we all had to pretend like they were regular people. It was VERY weird.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will say, that both of them would talk about "things happening" that weren't being reported and that they were each involved in something big. They definitely did not have any awareness that they might be in organizations with the same global leader(s).

            This kind of reminds me of Marc Lamont Hill.  Remember, FBIAnon said to check him out and what he does.  He recruits kids and takes them to Israel to train like militant rebels against the Israelis.  Hill then brings the kids back after militant training and brainwashing to go to all the Soros-sponsored protest events. Sounds like a cult as well.

              You are correct.  These people that Marc Lamont Hill is dealing with are BLM. Think Ferguson.  Sad people do not realize they are being played like pawns in a game of chess.
Divide the people and cause chaos.

               Just a hunch...but considering the info from George Webb video series (CF network plus /ISIS/Al Queda in Libya)...eventually the small groups will somehow be tied to the top: Keeping in mind that Antifa and other Soros funded radicals are international in scope.  Remember Hillary blathering some incoherent statement about the bottom up plus top down blows out the middle? lol...Thank God she lost!

             I say YES.  Right after the fire, I was looking at IG pages of people who commented on Jimmy Comet's IG.  I found one that had a friend who was killed in the fire. He had moved to Oakland from DC, was a gender confused cross dresser and musician.

               I did not archive it, but I just found him.  Joseph Matlock or Joey Casio ( stage name ),  an electronic musician from Portland, Ore. Again, I do remember him having ties to DC. His IG page has been removed.

                Reading he was from Portland, OR made me think of VooDoo Donuts. They also have a recording lablel now. Locations in Portland and Eugene, OR Denver, CO Austin, TX and now CityWalk, CA. When they started their business they went to Pico Rivera, CA "donut masters" to learn how to make donuts.  Pico Rivera is just southeast of LA. Their decor and donuts are all satanic themed. I don't know if they're conntected but here is a VOAT sub about them

                The weird thing is I had just read the sub about Backpage execs employing programming to their website to remove keywords to indicate underage ads for sex. My final thought as I read it was "by any means necessary". Then I see the above sub. Isn't BAMN an Alinsky tactic? What scum these people are in what they do to children. It needs to stop!

                 This fire always sounded suspicious.  First of all, police statements said their were NO INJURIES, either you died or you got out.  Ever hear of a fire like that ? The victims are all cut from the same cloth and many attended or graduated from UC Berkeley. They worked in music, video production, arts, dance, etc.  Here is a pre-fire photo and the first that comes up ( check the rug )

                   A hunch tells me this Ghost Ship was serving another purpose other than an 'art collective' and it was cleaned up with a fake fire. So many of these hipsters assume multiple identities and stage names, it would be simple to move them from place to place.

                     thanks.. Iv'e scanned them and eclectic, indeed.  I would also add 'suspicious' and 'fitting a pattern' of these Comet-like satellites around the country, all running programs of radical social change, transgenderism, art, music and video production.

            I think they are both: a human trafficking cult AND political hard-core globalist communists (oh wait that is one thing for them).

           <p>
            They recruit kids from middle school (Yvette probably has her go to list of young kids she's grooming for a future batch of 'activists'.)  "In 2009, according to the letter, Felarca “repeatedly solicited students to participate in protests” against a proposed charter school BUSD was considering, despite having been formally reprimanded about involving students in her political activities, and pursuing those activities during the work day."

            Falarca was one of the leaders of a 2014 protest with BLM...

             http://www.berkeleyside.com/2014/12/14/op-ed-bamns-protest-plans-calculated-to-cause-violence/
            </a>
            <br/>
            and a group of 1000 FB users created backlash against then Mayor Bates...
Sounds like BAMN, and their activities are also aimed at putting their people in city council positions, or even getting a Mayor into office.  That certainly would make child trafficking networks easier to set up and protect.  Also it gives them a pool of young protesters, on call, all the time...(see my other post on this thread about Jevon).
           </p>
           <p>
            Wait a minute...Is Soros running an international teen trafficking, political cult?  Forcing the kids into protester servitude? and whatever else they do with them?  WTF.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit:  This really bugs me...was Obama a cult leader?  By Jevon's account, young kids are targeted to become little coerced cult slave protestors...shipped around the country, cut off from parents and even BAMN members in their home town.  So all the BLM (Yvette Falarca lead a protest with them, are they filled with protest slaves too? 
When Trump's Chicago rally was shut down, or at one of his highly protested rallies, I remember how odd it was when they asked one young woman (could have been under 18) why she was protesting...she didn't answer, and when asked repeatedly she said something to the effect 'I'd rather not say'.  That always struck me a completely insane, go protest to shut down other people from being heard, yet having nothing else to say?  Now I'm wondering if she was a protest hostage!

              Good one!  There's some creepy happenings in Oakland and Berkley.
This thread has some good comments and info:

              "Dude I posted in here earlier about how you cant' trust city of berkeley or county of alameda or state of california and that the fed's need to be brought in to investigate antifa specifically in California, and the thread got deleted within less than 60 seconds after i posted that. the thread probably got deleted because of other content in it, specifically about antifa and naming names, but I am speaking about no specific indivudals here I am just saying that as a UC Berkeley alumni and someone who lived in Oakland for about 4 years while going to school in berkeley, they're all really corrupt. Oakland PD gets caught for the underage hookers and stuff, but Berkeley does all sorts of weird stuff and never gets caught. That mayor is probably a pedophile crossdresser and they celebrate it."

             <p>
              'I don't want to name names, but I remember getting to know one professor socially and at one point he admitted to going to Bohemian Grove. I don't know if I believe him, honestly, but there is also a Bohemian Club (like secret country club, but in the city) in San Francisco. It is all very Masonic, and lots of professors here apparently buy into it. I would imagine there is lots of pedophilia and crowley shit too, but its all modernized and in more of a grey area now, so its like a 15 year old twink that mayors usually get caught with (see portland, and others) but yea honestly there is some real satanist shit in Berkeley as well as Oakland and San Francisco. I think it is over 100 year olds, like from the rail road tycoon era, they were all masons, hearst family, all the families that built UC Berkeley are basically freemason or other secret society types, whether Jew, Crypto-Jew, or Gentile. Sooo many Jews on campus as well as in the city of Berkeley, but they're all generally crypto-Jews and atheist Jews. But then there are of course a few orthodox and the pro-israel students that lobby on sproul. Berkeley is satanic ZOG is my point."

              "BAMN have been primary organizers of the violent attacks on free speech activists and Trump supporters in California over the past two years. I think the mayor is conspiring with antifa to deny me my constitutional rights."

nah dude Berkeley already has its fair share of scares, remember the story about the homeless dude who broke into the UC Berkeley chanellor's house with a sword? Berkeley has so many local crazies already, I wonder how they are all handling this recent wave of antifa crazies.

dude I am telling you I did my undergraduate there and got to know grad students as well as some of the jewish pro-israel students including ones who literally would go to china for a year abroad and go to west china where the terrorists are and get like banned from china. there are some crazy zionist fucks at berkeley, a very small but very vocal minority that is constantly battling the vocal muslim students. i went there for my engineering degree so i stayed out of politics, but yea dude, my only request is that we use meme magic and citizen journalism to bring the truth out. Whatever that means for the mayor of Berkeley, I have no idea, but yes I suspect he is so full of himself he doesn't even hide the fact that he likes BAMN, both on facebook and in general."

            Link below,  UCB alum Jevon FB, 2014 'Berkley confessions'...former BAMN member. Joined when he was 14, was a member until almost 18 years old.   Details some of their corrupt and cult aspects (being held hostage for one thing).
           </p>
           <p>
            When he was 16.."When my family started to look for me, BAMN advised me that it was best that I move from my hometown (Detroit, MI) to live with BAMN members in another part of the country....
           </p>
           <p>
            They took me to Oakland, CA to live with Yvette Felarca and instructed me to change my name to "Chase Stern" and cut off all contact with family and friends and even other BAMN members in Detroit.  I complied, thinking that that would only be for a short time." (they lied)
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://archive.is/tJcHx">
             http://archive.is/tJcHx
            </a>
            Here are some highlights of info from what he experienced:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The organization is tightly controlled by two members, the President, Shanta , and another founding member named Leland."
           </p>
           <p>
            " When disagreements arise between base members of the group and the leadership (i.e. Shanta and Leland), that is when things get scary. In order to coerce people into doing what they want them to do, at the leadership's command, this organization engages in a whole host of disgusting behavior like physically dragging people to meetings and political events, denouncing members who disagree as crazy/suicidal and encouraging them to take unprescribed medication, stealing money and i.d. cards to restrict the movement of dissident members, spreading lies about such members to turn others against them, etc. The list goes on and on. The way the organization makes this possible is often by convincing members to abandon their lives and come live in BAMN households. There, such members often become financially dependent on BAMN and many times, have no choice but to comply with orders so that they can eat and not end up homeless. Furthermore, many of theBAMN members are teenagers so this fact makes it even more possible for BAMN to prey on people that become financially dependent on them."
           </p>
           <p>
            A few weeks before turning 18:  " When they realized they could not talk me out of leaving, they got physical. Yvette Felarca came into my room one night and instructed me to read out loud a statement that Shanta Driver had written and convinced me to sign about how my family was abusive. Tired of debating my decision with them, I refused. That night, Yvette and other BAMN members took turns sleeping by my bed to "make sure he doesn't go anywhere." They confiscated my house keys to restrict my movement."
           </p>
           <p>
            "... I realized that I was in a cult and not only was Shanta well aware of what was taking place but that it was her plan all along. I called my mom at that point and in the midst of me talking to her, one of the BAMN members, Adi Hoag, a former Berkeley student, screamed "Grab his phone!" and 3 BAMN members grabbed me and tried to take my phone. Luckily, they were all pretty slightly built women so I managed to push them off of me and make it outside the house. I ran to the neighbors, explained to them what was going on, and she let me inside and closed the door."
           </p>
           <p>
            There's more but that's a shortened version. (side note...I have an article somewhere of an Antifa connected pedo found hanging around a homeless camp, maybe to prey on Antifa teens tossed out on the streets? then they run back to Mommy Falarca's arms?)
