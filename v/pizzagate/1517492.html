<p>When the RudolphGiuliani Twatter account posted a series of very inflammatory statements coupled with a &quot;rudyspeaks@gmx.com&quot; email address, I sent an email to the gmx.com account attempting to verify the story before the account was shut down.  Previously I considered the event a likely Hoax, now however I have received a reply which elevates the incident to either active PsyOp or, incredible as it seems, possibly a true series of events.  I am still highly skeptical but I wanted to see if anyone at Voat has attempted similar contact.  If this is a true series of events, the significance is ground breaking.  If it is an active PsyOp, then I feel we have the ability to track the PsyOp from a skeptical perspective and analyze it further.</p>
<p>If you <em>have</em> received a similar response, please indicate the response.  If it is an identical  machine response, that indicates pure PsyOp.  If the responses are all individualized, it indicates one or more people who may be actually doing what they say.  I am <em>not</em> saying the Twats are confirmed by this email response, only that this is no mere faking of a Twatter account.</p>

Mr. Giuliani has been taken to a safe location and we are awaiting instructions from a group of people we call light workers, who work behind the scenes to protect people like Rudy who come forward. They are patriots within our government, protecting what is left of our Republic and Constitution.</p>
<p>Yes, Mr. Giuliani is in grave danger, but he is safe for now. And indeed, they are using CGI and other methods to &quot;replace&quot; him.</p>
<p>What appears to be a hired group of COINTELPRO agents have taken over the Internet, declaring Rudy\'s brave statements a &quot;hoax&quot; and pointing everyone to a completely fake Twitter account (<a href="https://twitter.com/RudyGiuliani">https://twitter.com/RudyGiuliani)</a>) that Mr. Giuliani has no access to and nothing to do with. These agents and agitators are easy to spot and identify.</p>
<p>We understand the skepcisim as well, but Mr. Giuliani\'s safety is paramount. His safety is the priority, and at a later time when his safety can be assured, he is expected to make a public announcement -- but not within the borders of the United States. We cannot state in more urgent terms how serious this issue is for his safety, and that of his family and some of his close friends.</p>
<p>Mr. Giuliani requests humbly that you spread his Official Statement far and wide on social media (this link -- <a href="http://henrymakow.com/2016/12/rudolph-giuliani-confirms.html">http://henrymakow.com/2016/12/rudolph-giuliani-confirms.html</a> -- contains the statement and his other Tweets for you to use).</p>
<p>The best way to help us is to spread the word, and re-post Rudy\'s statements about PizzaGate from his closed Twitter account using social media, like YouTube. His statements contain many truths that will lead you in the right direction. Do not let agitators and agents try to stop you, because they will, and they will attack and threaten you. If you feel your safety is in doubt, please do not proceed.</p>
<p>That is all we have for now. We will be in touch.</p>

Hello,</p>
<p>This email is in response to this #Twitter post:</p>

<p>I am assuming the account is genuine and the offer is genuine.  If not, shame on you!</p>
<p>I found this video researching random #PizzaGate related material in an archive.  I posted it publicly at the request of Victoria Lynn Rodriguez, the author of the video.  Some of us have tried to contact her but have not been able to do so.  Many of her online accounts are now down.</p>
<p><a href="https://vid.me/bLCx">https://vid.me/bLCx</a></p>
<p>Please look into this matter and, if you can, please update me on your findings, at least so far as whether or not this video is legitimate.  If she can be found safely that would be great.  I wish you the best in your efforts.</p>

            Lol such a fucking psyop. Cia gets more desperate by the day hahahha using 50 year old Star Wars Jedi mind tricks to confuse the public. To bad we all saw Star Wars and know what a Jedi mind trick is. Lmfao u know cia is pathetic when anyone can compare their psyop to STAR WARS.  They'll literally do the most desperate thing in the book. Pussys and lizards work in the Cia. If you ever wanna know how to kill lizards let me know :) I have a bearded dragon I finally put down the other day.  Hahahahahhahahahahahahah

            The confusion surrounding this smells like a PsyOp to me.  The CGI bit doesn't make much sense either.  I know they have a lot of resources at their disposal, but that doesn't seem likely to me.

            I would love for this to be true, but having read everything, I am highly confident that it is false.
           </p>
           <p>
            One thing people should keep in mind is that Steve Pieczenik is very optimistic about Trump overcoming this evil pedo coup, and Trump is also very happy and relaxed in his public statements. If they were stressed, we would see it. That is one important data point that we have to factor into all of our theories.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, does Trump know that the FBI has a picture/video that implicates HRC in sex crimes? That would be enough to put her in prison immediately. Trump has excellent military intelligence supporting him. He's not sweating, let's try to stay calm (but see my new thread on Trump assassination attempts).

            sorry, but that sounds like a pre-written response. which due to the detail, would not be unprecedented, even as genuine.

             Well, if more than one person attempts contact at the address, it would be interesting to collate the responses and compare them.  If the same response is given every time, probably a bot but if the responses vary per the content of the original inquiries, then at least it is likely there is a human running the "show".  I think we should not
             <em>
              assume
             </em>
             we know what is going on with Trump, with PizzaGate or pretty much anything else shady in government.
