<p>On March 19, 2016 hackers manage to fool then Clinton campaign manager John Podesta into changing the password of his gmail account through a basic phishing email. By July it starts raining Podesta emails through Wikileaks, resulting in a number of minor scandals: ties of Clinton to Wall Street and a variety of journalists, shenanigans of the already controversial Clinton Foundation, and concrete evidence that Clinton and the Democratic Party elite purposely undermined Bernie Sanders, Clinton\'s chief rival for the Democratic nomination.

<p>In an interesting development, the first few days of November 2016 - amidst continued releases of thousands upon thousands of Podesta emails by Wikileaks - saw the emergence of &quot;Pizzagate&quot; in the alternative media: the claim that words as &quot;pizza&quot; and &quot;pasta&quot; in the Podesta emails were used as code words to conceal trafficking and sexual abuse of children.

<p>When we look at a number of cited Podesta emails in prominent Pizzagate video clips - such as PizzaGate Definitive Factcheck: Oh My God on the YouTube channel of David Seaman\'s, a former &quot;liberal CIA&quot; Huffington Post contributor - at first glance one indeed is tempted to think that they reveal a kind of code language surrounding the terms &quot;pizza&quot; and &quot;pasta&quot;. However, being extensively familiar with the treacherous nature of disinformation, I checked all the citations in their full context on Wikileaks.

            you do realize that nothing is happening do you ? theres a bunch of posts that get reposted over &amp; over with the same reactions over and over ,
which is actually not the goal of this platform ; in the end its to organize the people against the establishment which is a logical result , people get angry ,
frustrated &amp; then step in to action. its inlogical to state that people find these facts , get angry &amp; tehn keep on repeating while at teh same time calling people to WAIT  &amp; do  NOTHING ,to put their trust in someone they dont know ( trump)  , but this is exactly what i see happening , in my eyes the signature of a PSYOP .

              I'm not refusing anything.. 
if you feel so strongly about the info on this site post some source links.. like everyone else on VOAT..
             </p>
             <p>
              I've supplied links for you... did you even read them?
             </p>
             <p>
              And the government don't need/want the people's help, they want to cull the population to 500 million, humans have emotion, hence this 'citizen investigation'
             </p>
             <p>
              Pedo/Sex Crimes/Human Trafficking etc are a 'profit less crime' for the courts...
Why put someone in jail for life at the cost of @$300,000 a year per inmate, instead they use the power of the info gathered/planted to blackmail to their profit/ benefit..
             </p>
             <p>
              It's quite clear the government aren't going to do fuck all about all of this, but for me personally it's about the power of free minded and free human beings standing together as one and saying, 
We know what's going on Worldwide, we will not be blinded by your propaganda anymore, knowledge is power and the truth will always provail.
             </p>
             <p>
              Use the search bar on VOAT and actually read some posts from 3-4months ago..
             </p>
             <p>
              All your answers are in this subverse

               you dont know what truth is. you do not think for yourself , instead like the rest , you follow the aproved narative  , achieving nothing.
i checked one link you posted which i allready knew. and yes , gov does not need help from the poor people ( slaves)
and no i will not find answers on the questions that popup . i have to many posts censored ( deleted) asking help in finding answers.
almost noone came around.

                Also -
ISGP briefly described Russia's establishments, including the most significant think tanks, societies and conferences. This aspect was never published in great detail due to a lack of time and funding to finish up a 50,000 word article.
               </p>
               <p>
                How much funding is actually needed to publish a 50,000 word doc on you're own website?
               </p>
               <p>
                And if it was such an important piece to list in the websites 'purpose'
wouldn't you do whatever it takes to publish..
Now that is what you call RETARDED!!!
               </p>
               <p>
                Sounds like funding from someone who's hands were dirty was threatened to be pulled..

            The article is quite clear in calling all Pizzagate researchers trolls and the investigation itself a hoax. It's a blatant hit piece.
           </p>
           <p>
            It debunks nothing. And to call the
            <em>
             Snopes
            </em>
            response an
            <em>
             investigative article
            </em>
            is ridiculous as that also debunks absolutely nothing. “None of it is true” is not “debunking”.
           </p>
           <p>
            To compare Pizzagate to theories such as a cruise missile hitting the Pentagon is pathetic. We all know it wasn't a plane. We all know that whatever really happened at Sandy Hook was covered up. We all know that one of the bombs at the Boston Marathon was a
            <em>
             sound bomb
            </em>
            and that a certain guy didn't have any legs anyway, he lost them in Afghanistan.
           </p>
           <p>
            It mentions
            <em>
             troll
            </em>
            or
            <em>
             trolling
            </em>
            16 times, and
            <em>
             propagandist
            </em>
            6 times. It reads like something from a 20 year old rookie at WaPo about a subject which the experienced journalists wouldn't touch with a bargepole.

              I certainly did read the entire article. As I said, at best it offers possible explanations for some of the anomalies. It does not debunk anything but comes across as matter of fact, it is very aggressive in its tone by constantly labelling legitimate researchers as trolls or propagandists. Actually, that
              <em>
               is
              </em>
              propaganda.

               read my post , i just urged everyone intrested in pizzagate to checkout teh article &amp; think about what you think you'll achieve
with your links &amp; leads found on socialmedia sites that get endlessly repeated &amp; posted over &amp; over while meanwhile NOTHING  is happening.
speaking about agressive , checkout 98% of the responses i get on this post , THATS PRETTY AGRESSIVE ? why is that ?

                 look , an email is most of the time part of a longer conversation , so if you check the complete emails from podesta,
its possible you get another context like for example the mentioning of walnut sauce , when you look it up its a very
popular sauce in italian dishes , so it is possible that walnutsauce is really just that. 
podesta is italian not ?
for sure you haven't checked the rest of the website , probbably to bussy to defend the energy you have put into pg ,
but you really should check the rest of the website &amp; see for youself the information , then ask yourself why would the same author 
post disinfo on his website ? so he can discredit the other 99% of his website ? does that seem a logical thing to do if you have put 
so much effort in a website regarding corruption &amp; humantrafficking ?
                </p>
                <p>
                 if you want to make a real change start being honest , you are aggressive (with no reason !).

            This is very interesting. It's certainly the best attempt to date to debunk the food related code words. That said, while some of the explanations could certainly hold water - not all of them do.
           </p>
           <p>
            First off... let's be careful not to quickly dismiss the author. He provided a very thorough case behind 9/11 being an act of demolition:
            <a href="https://isgp-studies.com/911-evidence-for-explosives-and-thermite-at-WTC">
             https://isgp-studies.com/911-evidence-for-explosives-and-thermite-at-WTC
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Now... on to the debunking of the debunking:
           </p>
           <p>
            *email of John Podesta to Herb Sandler of the Sandler Foundation on Christmas Eve: "Ps. Do you think I'll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?"
           </p>
           <p>
            Explanation: Looking at the entire email, it becomes clear that Sandler used to give Podesta pasta for Christmas, but that he changed this tradition in 2015 and sent over "a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses". Podesta's children would also be coming over and it appears what Podesta is saying is that he has been playing some kind of dominos game with his children involving these gifts. Certainly there's no child abuse context here.*
           </p>
           <p>
            No, sorry, that explanation still makes absolutely no sense given the original phrasing of the question. You don't play dominoes "ON" cheese or "ON" pasta. That's like equating those foods to a drug... "Do you think I'll do better playing Call of Duty on weed or on coke?" The context is still highly questionable.
           </p>
           <p>
            Next big problem:
           </p>
           <p>
            *This email from chief Bill Clinton advisor Doug Band to John Podesta and others only consists of the sentence "As John said, it doesn't get any better than this" an included picture of two Asian women eating pizza with a child. The Pizzagate claim here is that the women are child traffickers and with this picture were displaying their "merchandise" (the child) to key Clinton staffers. Additional weight is provided to this claim by bringing up the fact that these women were involved in investigating a human trafficking ring from North Korea.
           </p>
           <p>
            Explanation: The women in question are Laura Ling and Euna Lee. They were arrested in North Korea in March 2009 and released on August 5, 2009 when Bill Clinton personally flew to North Korea and escorted the women back to the United States. Thus the fact that Clinton staffers were distributing an email of these women eating pizza - something they themselves are extremely fond of doing - three days after their release isn't the slightest bit suspicious.
            <strong>
             The fact that Ling and Lee were investigating human trafficking before their arrest isn't the slightest bit relevant here
            </strong>
            . As for the child, it is Laura Ling's then six-year-old daughter, Hana. Yes, that's how low disinformer have sunk.*
           </p>
           <p>
            Ok, ok, really? "The fact that Ling and Lee were investigating human trafficking before their arrest isn't the slightest bit relevant here" How is it not relevant? We're seeing links of multiple organizations and activities with those who are supposed to be researching/helping victims... but actually may be doing the opposite. Also, the researcher conveniently left out the fact that they flew back on Steve Bing's airplane and not a government vehicle... Clinton and Bing were both of Epstein's flight log. That's a whole lot to process and cannot simply be dismissed (
            <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/5jiMO4dzi">
             http://www.webcitation.org/5jiMO4dzi)
            </a>
            ).
           </p>
           <p>
            *Lastly, "September 3, 2015: An email to John Podesta from White House colleague Todd D. Stern reads: "I'm dreaming about your hotdog stand in Hawaii". Not really pizza or pasta, but this food has also been promoted as representing some kind of hidden code.
           </p>
           <p>
            Explanation: The context isn't clear, but it appears Podesta told Stern about a hot dog stand in Hawaii at some point that he may or may not own or have a stake in. Based on the email, there's not the slightest reason to suspect Stern was using code for some hidden boy brothel.*
           </p>
           <p>
            Really? You travel to Hawaii... and of all the things you can see/do/talk about, you are DREAMING about a hotdog stand? And one of the most powerful men in DC has allocated resources to purchase a stake in a hotdog stand in the furthest state possible from where he lives? No... sorry. That explanation makes no sense from a logical standpoint. From a literal POV? Yes... that makes sense. But for Podesta to purchase a stake or an entire hotdog stand in HAWAII, would be similar to a normal person purchasing a vending machine in Alaska. It's pure nonsense.
           </p>
           <p>
            While not food related - it's also convenient that the researcher didn't have to address Luzzato and the hot tub kids.

             keep in mind the person didnt want to write about pizzagate , so maybe he has not put his 110% maximum effort in that article.
and i also have problems with the dominoes ON pizza , and other points ,  but like i mentioned before in other comments , this pg
could be a psyop. we have to keep this in mind. childabuse has happened for 1000s of years in allot of cultures, so in teh background it has alwyas been there
(with the elite&amp; some percent of the common folks) the things we see in pizzagate is that it is worldwide , &amp; every highprofile child abuse case involving elite 
is probbably connected in teh same network. for this i see no reason as to keep pg "local (us only) &amp; why no worldwide protests by the common people?
etc so many questions so little answers , thx for the typing explosion ! :)

            , I read the article. From day one, I had been on the lookout for convincing explanations why those Podesta emails are completely innocent. I haven't found one, and I have to admit, this one is worse than most others. The explanations in this article do the contrary for me.

New WorldCorpo video, 02/20/2017. Listen closely at the beginning. You can hear "SKIPPY", John Podesta's alter ego. submitted by ButtSaladSandwich to pizzagate
fremar -1 points (+0|-1) 1 month ago
oh please , so the guy owns a website with fuckedup videos , gets hacked , gets posted everywhere on teh internet , somehow he doesn't know and keeps his website online with new added content ? he knows hes a pedophile but he doesnt know about pizzagate ? look , it would be awesome if anybody "finds" the ultimate evidence sure , but this seems retarded , really , smart enough to kidnap kids ,abuse them , murder them , eat them and not getting caught ? but then just in the right moment getting "hacked" so all this comes to light ? naaah dont think so. but thats just my opinion.

                 agree with what ? yeah i dont think thats podesta on teh video ( hes way to powerful t o let this kind of videos be taped in the first place &amp; then "leaked" )
i agree that there are more sides to pizzagate then just the abuse part. like pizzagate being psyop to for example "win" the peoples "trust" back so you can fuck em in the ass for many years to come. again.

              We all know the game: build a good reputation, then use this to spread disinfo, which people are likely to believe then. This article may be disinfo, or it is simply someone who cannot for the life of himself believe that PG is possible. I know there really exists a walnut sauce. Other "findings" may have innocent explanations as well. But I bet my life on it that many of them do not have an innocent explanation. And none of Podesta et al have come forward and explained them - you have to look at the bigger picture, then everything falls into place. And supercomputers may not be able to do what they need.

               wrong supercomputers are really really really fast , also a  government is always  years ahead in devolopment of technology
&amp; controlling the masses . the person who wrote the article wrote allot of articles on that website , which is a very good researched based database 
fro childabuse , humantrafficking , corruption , etc. so this someone has no problems believing in the possibility of pg being real.
you also have to look at the bigger picture .

             wow relax , have you even read the whole article , and have you checked the rest of the website ? this is not disinfo.
the website has allot of solid information about allot of differnet cases involving childabuse , human trafficking etc.
maybe you should check the other posts i made , before you start accusing someone.
i still have,'t got any answer on the following FACTS
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              if a country is run by a superelite who are in possesion of supercomputers capable of intercepting ANY form of COMMUNNICATION 
 using pattern recognition programs ,from where the "need" for "HELP" of the people finding "LEADS" in socialmedia sites etc ?
             </li>
             <li>
              if policereports dating 1994 state that 50% of the worldeconomy is in hands of criminal organisations , what does this mean for the economy in 2017 ????
             </li>
             <li>
              why is there the "need' for keeping this "pizzagate" so local ( US only ) when its obvious childabuse &amp; humantrafficking by superelite is happening WORLDWIDE ????
             </li>
             <li>
              why get most of my posts mentioning these FACTS get so easily removed ????
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             so sorry to say but not a shill here or pedo or whatever. just using my common sense.

               Yeah, I did look this up too... there are recipes for walnut based pasta sauces...

               While this particular example can be explained away, some of the other explanations don't sit well with me.

                yes its true for me also , some explanations feel strange to me to. but we have to keep in mind that pizzagate could
be a psyop. there are to many questions as to why the need for help from the people when you have supercomputers that intercept any form of communication for years 24/7 ?
etc. so many questions left unanswerd.

                 Even using the English language version: Walnut Sauce brings you a page full of recipes with TV chef's Nigella Lawson's recipe as the top hit from her show Nigella Bites Christmas Special.  Perhaps google has tweaked their pizzagate algorithims, but this show first aired in 2006.  The first review of her walnut sauce recipe was 3761 days ago.  When these emails came first came out, there was no way you could have did a search for walnut sauce without seeing it really and truly did exist.  It didn't take you to a porn site or some super sketchy place, if you wanted to know what walnut sauce was, the answer was right there on the food network.

                 It exposes the absolute deception of "codeword research" at the very start of this.  There's simply no way that could have been done in good faith.  It was done to deceive people.

                 Cheese Pizza was the term they used to use on 4chan to mean child porn.

                 Go search the Podesta emails for the exact phrase "cheese pizza" and tell me how many emails come up.

                  there is a handkerchief code , maybe you should see the movie cruising with al pacino. 
but this is in the gayscene , the pedoscene wanted to associate themselves with the gayscene but teh gayscene never really stood behind this. (check nambla)

                   Yes, there's a handkerchief code. but there is no color that means pedophilia  that's not part of the code.  It's like looking what a touchdown is the rule book of major league baseball, it's not there.

                Now you're shilling, aren't you? Do you think I'd be wasting my time here if we had no evidence? Evidence is exactly what brought me here. No hard proof yet, but solid circumstantial evidence.

                 I need a lot more. I need hard proof. I'm not shilling, I'm just trying to understand your logic. I mean, how can those emails ever be debunked to the communities liking. It would be impossible. The emails are not evidence because they are pure speculation, and you want hard evidence to debunk, drum roll.........pure speculation.

                  What I'm saying is that until you can provide real counter evidence to debunk the emails, these emails are not going anywhere. They will remain in the pile of
                  <em>
                   circumstantial evidence
                  </em>
                  we have collected for pizzagate. I'm not saying the emails are 100% proof that these people are guilty, I'm saying they are suspicious and will remain suspicious until a proper innocent explanation is given by those who sent these emails.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We're all hoping to find the smoking gun of all smoking guns... the hard evidence that will change everything. But so far we only have circumstantial evidence. We have to keep digging since law enforcement doesn't want to do their job and do a proper investigation. That's where we're at today.

              You're just spreading MSM propaganda.. 
I read the whole article in the link and it's nothing more than the MSM narrative
             </p>
             <p>
              The explanations to the podesta emails are nothing more than unsubstantial opinions
             </p>
             <p>
              The 'explanations' here on pizzagate are backed with sourced evidence and not fueled by a personal agenda, more an agenda of actually making a positive change and helping the innocent in this fucked up world
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe the Washington Post/CNN would be interested in your link for reference

all are digital / online. no hardcore evidence , paper or something ....

            <p>
             December 24, 2015: email of John Podesta to Herb Sandler of the Sandler Foundation on Christmas Eve: "Ps. Do you think I'll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?"
            </p>
            <p>
             Explanation: Looking at the entire email, it becomes clear that Sandler used to give Podesta pasta for Christmas, but that he changed this tradition in 2015 and sent over "a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses". Podesta's children would also be coming over and it appears what Podesta is saying is that he has been playing some kind of dominos game with his children involving these gifts. Certainly there's no child abuse context here.

             Yep.  The article ignores 99% of the actual pizzagate evidence, instead focusing on stuff that either was misunderstood or
             <em>
              could
             </em>
             have an innocent explanation.  Flairing as disinfo.

               No, not really.  FBIanon's claims started it.  The "pizza-related map" email was just a clue that led us to Alefantis (and this article's alternative explanation for that email is extremely weak, as is the explanation for the chickenlovers IG photo hashtag).

                The majority of the public who is aware of PG and was new to these forums who didn't spend their summer on 4chan came to know about PG through Podesta's emails of JA's IG. And cmon man, there has been no other logical explanation of the map besides this one. Nothing else jives, at all.

              Why the f@#$ are you flairing this as disinfo? Let people make up their own mind, this is a cowardly move! I've been saying for a while now that we need to focus on what's real and what's not to further help this investigation. We don't want to waste too much time in the wrong rabbit holes and I believe the Podesta emails to be completely benign but at the same time strongly believe in pizza/pedogate. Its a very unpopular view around but just because something doesn't fit the original and popular narrative of PG doesn't mean we shouldn't consider it. Personally I believe The Podesta emails to be DISINFORMATION and a hindrance to our reputation. There is just nothing there! Here I delve into the reasons why

               You cannot dismiss all the Podestas emails like that. This is not how it works. You cannot just think of an alternate interpretation and conclude "see, there's nothing to see here, move along.".

               He
               <em>
                could
               </em>
               be talking about real pasta and real cheese and real dominoes so let's throw this email in the trash. Really?
              </p>
              <p>
               While we're at it let's throw jimmycomet's instagram in the trash too because hey after all this guy
               <em>
                could

               only have a dark sense of humor and it's not illegal.
              </p>
              <p>
               We cannot do this. I'm all for revisiting the emails with fresh eyes, but so far there has not been a single debunking of any email.

                With the same logic that you are using I could take any email about food ever written by anyone and twist and turn it into having a sadistic meaning. The logical and reasonable explanation of the verbage in the emails is not an "alternative representation" rather something that doesn't make any sense at all in literary terms such as the ones reached by such a stretch in Pizzagate, is an alternative representation. Same thing goes as if an email by Podesta said outright that he is raping children and someone representing him said no, raping children is just a funny way of him saying "let's have a dinner party" That is an example of something obvious being twisted in to an alternative meaning just to fit a narrative....

                 I am completely against pedophilia now. Before I thought, hey, if the kid consents, it's fine. If they're being paid to do it, it's fine.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Nah that shit don't fly.

                 This is child sex slavery, murder and probably torture and grooming for new ultra-sadists. What child would want to fuck an old man or woman?
                 <em>
                  sigh
                 </em>
                 Alas a child could understand money's power very young and it could be consensual on that basis. But I don't want that. I don't want that to be a "thing" or part of a "culture".

                   I guess I was. I mean, for me, the only instances of pedophilia I really knew about was Mary Kay Laterneau and... that's really it. I mean, before Pizzagate I was a Hillary supporter, and thought Bill Clinton was just a... normal guy besides the whole Monica Lewinsky thing. It's in this thread because along with my new understanding of pedophilia, those emails are not fucking innocent. None of them.

              no its not true , the writer of the article really did his homework just as he did with the rest of the website.
if you showed some engagement , checkout the rest of the website , before starting to flair something as disinfo.

             pizzagate seems to be allot more then just childabuse, pizza, pasta , etc.

                    No hard feelings. So you think that the Podesta emails could be a psyop? Wow, sorry but that just does not make any sense to me. The emails were leaked and they are real. They are the entry point to Pizzagate. WIthout the emails, "pizzagate" doesn't exist and we're not here today on this forum.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Without the emails, it's business as usual... and probably HC is the president of the US.

                     no i think pizazgate as a whole is being used as a psyop.
before pizzagate there was allready worldwide spread humantrafficking &amp; satanism etc.
the emails are part of communication, communication gets intercepted 24/7 for years. (ask snowden)
so "they" knew the whole time. why wait to "leak" these emails? how is it possible a website like wikileaks
can just "leak" all this "secret" information &amp; every time they do its a complete surprise to "them" (government)
ah you say because the internet , we have a right for infoprmation ! yeah true that ! how about your right for free electricity ?
or clean air ? how about clean water? etc .... you see ? so many questions start popping up.

                      I really respect your point of view but I don't agree with what you're saying at all. What you're speaking of is what we could call 5D chess...
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Things are not so elaborated. We must remain grounded and down to earth and not get too carried away. If you just observe what is going on, you know that "they" are not happy about that Pizzagate thing and that they are trying to suppress it. They would not create an elaborated plot, incriminating themselves in the process, just to frame us in their next few moves. It would be suicide for them. You can see for yourself, more and more people are getting educated about the real problem that is child sex trafficking
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The evil masterminds are obvious in their tactics. They don't play 5D chess, it's too risky.

                       you're saying yes &amp; no at the same time. youre right that we have to stay grounded but honestly , countless posts all the same stuff , over and over
all the same "opinions" &amp; "findings" &amp; none of these give answers to obvious questions that pop up . and the questions that follow are really important questions.
trafficking has happened for very very long time , worldwide , yet the narrative here is to keep it local , just washington dc ? really ?? why is this ? doesn't that look and feel
like an agenda ?  we need to take this thing way further and take this worldwide to the streets if you want to see real change. if you want keep it local (usa onlyà then who benefits ??? who ?? yess thats right , just trump ( you know that rich fucker that likes money just like the others ) so we are not going to be framed but the attention that we give to this is going to be used for their benefit with in teh end no real change. no new world. just the same old same old.

                        You're right that it's not just about DC, no one said that though. I've been here since december and people have discussed similar scandals happening outside the USA and DC (Hampstead coverup, Norway pedophile ring, Dutroux, Jimmy Saville, etc). I'm sure most know here that these cases are all connected somehow.

                         yes very nice that you are pretty sure , but the ones that maintain the narrative on this platform ( mods /admins) 
do not want progress. they do not participate in thinking , asking questions ,which is very suspect i think.

any form of communication 24/7 with supercomputers whith special pattern recognition programs &amp; the like , for YEARS.

              What's stupid is believing that you actually have a government  that  would even care about finding this shit.  The Government hasn't given a shit about us or children or anything other than their own sick fucking agendas in a very very long time.  If you seriously believe that they do then you definitely need to wake the fuck up!  Our only hope is  Trump.... and only time will tell if he will do anything about it...

               trump is part of that same government ( and for the record i like trump simply because he has zero experience in politics )
that really only needs us to shut up, pay our taxes , give our consent for law changing &amp; die . why not put your trust in someone you know
for sure who made a difference ? ( yeah im talking about you ! trust YOURSELF &amp; take it to teh streets ) putting your trust in someone you dont know
&amp; then sit and wait to see if something happens is insane from my pov.

                 i also went full force with the pizzagate , just like the rest of here , but then i realized that a part of me was reacting emotionally ,
so i started to ponder the reason , the reason for teh help of the same people they have been enslaving for so long , why do we matter 
to them ? etc  thats why im still here to find answers on these questions for all of us not just for myself.
what do you mean you obviously trust yourself by putting your trust in someone you dont know ? you dont know trump, the only thing you do know about trump is that he is
rich as fuck, so he likes money. &amp; what do rich fucks do with there money ? look after themselves.
that is what you know for sure , the rest is all speculation. now if this pizzagate is not a psyop , then why no worldwide protests against the worldwide establishment?
this cp shit happens worldwide not only in washington dc or haiti ! 
this article is not mine and its not that great , it offers a differnt view on pg. makes you want to use your brain.
