<p><a href="http://www.historyisaweapon.org/defcon1/bernprop.html">http://www.historyisaweapon.org/defcon1/bernprop.html</a></p>
<p>Archetypes are powerful images which may or may not reside &quot;a priori&quot; in the human subconscious mind. As such, archetypes are very powerful &quot;motivators&quot; when conveying information.</p>
<p>Edward Bernays is not only the nephew of Sigmund Freud, but he SINGLEHANDEDLY &quot;invented&quot; the modern Public Relations industry, and basically put madison Avenue on the map.</p>
<p>communications:
To the extent that pizzagate has been said to be &quot;losing steam&quot;, that is due to a complete lack of CONCISE COMMUNICATIONS on our part with other people on our own social media sharing.</p>
<p>Bernays has the cure for that. READ IT, and GET SAVVY.</p>
<p>MEMES are something similar to paid advertisements: When well crafted, they\'re IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED. </p>
<p>They also short-circuit normal conscious information channels, and therefore offer DIRECT ACCESS to the subconscious mind of the viewer.</p>
<p>We should be concentrating out efforts on factual, crafted, eye- and -attention catching headlines, brief (synopsis) articles, and MEMES in particular in our social media communications.</p>
<p>As such, and if we do our homework, then we can take advantage of:</p>
<p>• Increased visibility.  • Increased attention and reaction (likes, views, shares, etc.).   • Increased retention of basic facts, data.   • Increased communication effectiveness.   • Increased public awareness of &quot;all things pizzagate&quot;.</p>
<p>I\'ve created many memes over the years, and could post one here you\'d instantly recognize, because it\'s been used ENDLESSLY over the past 8 years, and now exists in hundreds of different (but easily recognizable) forms - but I won\'t. I don\'t want to prejudice anyone\'s ability or creativity, and besides - that meme got out &quot;into the wild&quot; veyr quickly, where it has been repeated so many tens of thousands of times and in so many media types and format at present, that I could not POSSIBLY have made it this popular BY MY EFFORTS ALONE. Not at all, I don\'t have that much time available in the day, nor do I have those kind of resources.</p>
<p>AND WE ONLY NEED ONE MEME OF THIS TYPE, to &quot;blow&quot; #pizzagate / #pedogate wide open again in the public consciousness. Just one - but a dozen or so, collectively, circulating around on social media WOULD BE MUCH BETTER.</p>
<p>And that is the point, create EFFECTIVE, INCISIVE, EASILY RECOGNIZABLE memes, MEMES THAT PEOPLE WANT TO STEAL.</p>
<p>Some rules for this:
• TO HELL with your personal or institutional &quot;branding&quot; - just use #pizzagate or #pedogate... THAT IS YOUR &quot;BRANDING&quot; for this project. Capish? This encourages people to STEAL / LIFT / BORROW / SHARE / DUPLICATE your work, without FEELING like they\'re &quot;taking your work away from you&quot;, and that\'s the point. You WANT them to take your work and post it everywhere. So sorry, but f*ck you if you are the type of person that needs your name or website on everything you do, because  &quot;public information sharing&quot; is obviously not your cup of tea.Stop reading this, and go back to reading your 45th &quot;pizzagate&quot; article of the day, and becoming more and more depressed about trying to find a way to &quot;do something about it,&quot; or maybe just give public information sharing and meme creation a try (hint. hint.)</p>
<p>• BE ACCURATE, but always use a &quot;weaponized&quot; version of accuracy. Hints: Cut to the chase. DON\'T be afraid to use phrases of speech, your own unique voice, unique points of view, bold colors or images, humor, or irony.  
</p>
<p>• Make your points SIMPLE, which will often leave PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS in the mind of your audience. From the PUREST communications, great ideas will flow, and the public WILL respond (you may not always be AWARE that the public is responding, but they will respond anyway). </p>
<p>• Don\'t be afraid to be controversial, different, opinionated or unique. These are all positive things, because they will make your meme/communications STAND OUT FROM THE CROWD... and that\'s what you want, even if it\'s not 100% accurate, and merely reflects your &quot;informed opinion&quot;, based on reasonably accurate data which you are aware of, and with to convey... because at least in America, your &quot;opinion&quot; still counts for something. And you may never know how many people AGREE with that opinion, unless and until you TRY. BUT FIRST, they need to be EXPOSED yo your &quot;opinion&quot; - so go forth, and share that. Fearlessly, to the best of your abilities.</p>
<p>• FACTS ARE POWERFUL. STRIKING IMAGES ARE MUCH MORE POWERFUL. But together, used intelligently, strategically and with purpose, in this &quot;weaponized&quot; / almost-Madison Avenue approach? As placed in juxtaposition toward or reinforcement of one another, words and images can become EXTREMELY powerful, instantly recognizable MASS COMMUNICATION VEHICLES which convey otherwise complicated thoughts, feelings, or emotions at the very first glance, in a matter of a split second. And that is a fact. [for instance: Did you know that you make MOST of your &quot;purchasing decisions&quot; within 5 seconds after SEEING the desired product? You basically do... though you might spend 2 minutes, 2 weeks or 2 months convincing yourself of that decision\'s &quot;validity&quot;... and then purchase the product anyway, despite objections from friends/family/partner at a later time. Effective Memes operate just like this.]</p>
<p>So yeah, we can win this battle, with pure #pizzagate awareness - and we will do that by creating more effective, humorous, infomratonal and opinionated memes... because WHAT ARE THE PAEDOS GOING TO DO?</p>
<p>Are they going to &quot;out meme&quot; us, by showing pictures of naked children? That won\'t fly. Are they going to argue that &quot;children are asking for it?&quot; That\'s dead on arrival. Are they going to single out all the wonderful charitable work that someboyd like a John Podesta or a James ACHILLES Alefantis has done, as if that EXCUSES child trafficking? Are they going to push for legalization of child trafficking?</p>
<p>No. All they can do, is push the &quot;normalcy bias&quot;, as they attempted to do with this NYT article, and that\'s about it because paedophilia is still a HIGHLY controversial subject - which is why they hide in the shadows:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/opinion/pedophilia-a-disorder-not-a-crime.html?_r=0">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/opinion/pedophilia-a-disorder-not-a-crime.html?_r=0</a></p>
<p>We cannot allow them the &quot;upper hand&quot; in this discussion, not even if the NYT decides to plaster pedo arguments all over their first page, above the fold, right under the banner. No way. </p>
<p>So let\'s work SMARTER, and not necessarily harder. Let\'s EDUCATE ourselves and become more effective communicators... we CAN do that. I\'ve seen a lot of the work in here, some of it is FABULOUS... now, we just need to get the DISTILLED VERSION of a mere FRACTION of this work, out to the public, and I think the time is ripe for effective memes. </p>
<p>Go forth and prosper. Let\'s post a few here, as we go. ANd DON\'T be afraid to steal someone else\'s idea, if you\'re trying to make improvements - it doesn\'t MATTER whose meme is better, what matters is that people absorb this information, that we exploit their confirmation bias in meaningful and informative (responsible) ways, and that we create some kick-ass art and have fun in the process.</p>
<p>Plus it\'s a great outlet for the &quot;artist&quot; in all of us. So try it - don\'t be afraid to &quot;go public&quot; or &quot;get political&quot;. Hell - start an anonymous social media account or download site so people can access your HQ memes, and let\'s get started. Lets have some fun with this as we expose these perverts - I\'m tired of letting them make me feel like shit every time I discover the latest f*cked up thing they\'re indulging in... FIGHT BACK. Let\'s do this.</p>',

            here's another example, based on the now-infamous Johnny Gosch kidnapping case, which is still unresolved.
           </p>
           <p>
            Required about 30 minutes. Acquired photo, "polaroid" look developed naturally while formatting... typeface is Markerfelt, which is perfect for the hand-noted Polaroid look. Gosch's whereabouts are still unknown, so this is TERRIBLY relevant to pizzagate and pedogate. Total time budget about 30 minutes.

             correctamundo... and it's high time we began using their own tools against them, eg: Bernays' own techniques, and the responsible "weaponization" of our pizzagate  pedogate memes for public dissemination and information.
            </p>
            <p>
             Meme idea: Perhaps the BEST, most DIRECT meme idea for "all that"? Is using a web image of the Podesta pedo-bros next to their police mug likenesses (all over the web), as well with an image of the missing girl. Maybe follow the idea I used for the Gosch image, child's name and date she went missing, #pizzagate / #pedogate... Freud in this instance is secondary, he was likely covering for Podestas since he was out of country that day.
            </p>
            <p>
             Remember, "less complicated / direct / graphically based" is always better - we're dealing with low-information media users who (fortunately for us) have very high information uptake times... seconds, fractions of a second... due to Pavlovian training via television, mostly, but that works in our favor because we can cut STRAIGHT to the subconscious with a well-crafted meme...

            here's a first example: wordy, to say the least (due to all the type on the page), but a good example of something which MIGHT make a decent meme:

            FOOTNOTES
           </p>
           <p>
            Because archive.org was used as the file upload site, the file will remain PERMANENTLY available to the public, and is absolutely free to download and use, without restrictions.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would suggest others do the same. Now to display, most browsers should show it from the web address. At any rate, free to use/alter/whatever. Took less than an hour to hunt down images, manipulate, and add text. I spent about 5 minute mulling over the idea, and refined it as the images took shape. Text was improvised, edited for one-word recognizability (due to the heavy text appearance of media in use).
           </p>
           <p>
            Upload to archive.org was fast, due to small jpg file size. High resolution jpeg file was easy to create. Feel free to use, share, post whatever... and CREATE AND DISTRIBUTE YOUR OWN.
