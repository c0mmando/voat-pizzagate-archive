            <p>
             The senior pastor of the First Presbyterian Church says Matlak has been a member there since 2009. A flyer on the church's website shows Matlak even held bible studies at his home for children where they could swim and learn about God.

            I wonder if the former pastor found out about the child abuse at the lawyer's poolside bible study, and if that was why the church was firing him.
