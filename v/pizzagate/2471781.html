             I hadn't seen the Abel Danger stuff. I don't tend to follow him.  Some of the stuff seems so fantastical.. like this for example:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Samantha Cameron graduated from City &amp; Guilds’ Camberwell College of Arts; she is the former creative director of Smythson where she allegedly tracked and moved victims of pedophile and lesbian snuff-film raves with dual-use City &amp; Guilds ‘bona vacantia’ products or services such as leather &amp; skin passport covers (Leathersellers), Menzies Aviation weapons cargo and paramilitary-passenger handling systems (Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators and Information Technologists) and Newspaper Distribution (Stationers and Newspapermakers); she was allegedly alerted by her City &amp; Guilds lesbian agents that Gareth Williams had enrolled at Central St Martin’s College of Art and Design in London and appeared to have hacked into Matrix 5 AOSIS network which she had helped to set up to launder CO2e money through her family office at D2 Banking Canada Square, Canary Wharf; evidence she procured a continuity of government authority to organize an illegal rave from Miriam Clegg, the Spanish wife of extorted man-in-the-middle Lord President of Council, Nick Clegg; evidence she used that authority to organize a City &amp; Guilds lesbian rave at which Gareth Williams died

             Do you think this could be true?

              Oh sorry, I meant I thought the AD info would have come up if you searched for "Rebekah Brooks," and that you may have glanced at it.
             </p>
             <p>
              I just remembered I found the AD post in a roundabout way.  I wanted to attempt to cut through the News of the World phone hacking and her "outing of pedophiles" items, so I set Google back to prior to 12.31.10 and searched for 'Rebekah Wade is a paedophile.'

              I have no idea.
             </p>
             <p>
              I was going to preface my comment about his allegations with "For what it's worth," but I did not want to insult him because in my heart of hearts I lean
              <em>
               a little
              </em>
              toward Field's information being true.
             </p>
             <p>
              If it is, I wonder if he is brilliantly presenting it so that it's intentionally almost unreadable, and just sounds so kooky, to protect his loved ones and himself.
             </p>
             <p>
              That's a lot of "ifs," I know.
             </p>
             <p>
              But I wouldn't put anything past the people willfully in these cults.  I'm not sure if he is saying in the excerpt you posted that they made snuff film victims into leather and passport covers, but why wouldn't they.  As far as I recall, snuff film victims were made into food items by some of my relatives when I was younger; as far as I remember, some were delivered to deletes, and some for a time to a restaurant, so it sounds plausible enough at least to me.  From what I recall, certain people had certain tasks, I don't know how it was decided, so it seems realistic-ish to me that SC had a task at one time of keeping track of and transporting victims, then their bodies/parts, to wherever.  Everyone seemed to have a job in the group.
             </p>

              EDIT to add:
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't follow Abel Danger either.  At one time I read a bit about the White's club death betting stuff, which did not seem all that unrealistic for some reason, but that's as far as I looked into his information.

             The shock-horror acquittal of Rebekah Brooks was not a huge surprise to those who have been in court for the past few months. Reporters have said privately that she did well in front of the jury, using her mythical charm. It's possible. For no story about Brooks is complete without the word "charisma". She is a witch who uses her sex-hair magick to do evil for Satan incarnate, Rupert Murdoch. The way in which she is portrayed is quite extraordinary. Tabloid values truly do win.
