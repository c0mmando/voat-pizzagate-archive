            In all fairness...
1.   Reddit is filled with CTR paid shills who bash everything they view as a thread.  Paid for by David Brock, Jimmy Comet's ex-bf/co-owner of his house.
2.  CTR took Pizzagate forum down by posting a bunch of personal info (doxxing) and accusations constantly and the mods couldn't keep up with the b.s. posts.

              When pulled the sub had 30,000 members.   Was growing exponentially.   MUCH smaller and smarter here honestly.   More detailed analysis and we don't have 50 people a day joining posting the same debunked theories.
