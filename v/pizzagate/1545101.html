            Im sure it doesn't take long to realize she's been in the Clinton's pockets since then., She's benn a confidant and sex-party planner, since Bill's early days in office.

             "Based on the information release by Wikileaks and the Panama Paper leaks., These individuals provide us with blatant evidence, that describes them engaging in RICO fraud, deception, racketeering, money laundering, coercion, collusion, and treason. These acts where described by Podesta Email #52046, #2874, and many more.
            </p>
            <p>
             This, more than implicates them in multiple crimes., Especially once tying in the Panama Paper leaks, far more crimes can be attributed. This more than constitutes an investigation, but because of the number of wealthy individuals involved in this., No federal prosecutor is wanting to touch this case.

             Among these parties and those "invested" in them and "donating"., They compose and compile, the worlds largest and most intricately involved laundering group in history.

             Other than being absolute CRAP,  Commodore Gilgamesh is clearly involved with the Majestic Ape / Heavy Breathing videos and vice versa. Who the fuck pays for all that crap? They've got good equipment, all the time in the world, and absolutely zero talent.
            </p>
            <p>
             pujoldotcom may be sharing artistic "talent", use the word loosely, with Majestic Ape also.

             They get paid to sit around all day watching shit (Everything Is Terrible) VHS tapes, sort them into pedo/occult bins, then edit to create near subliminal stimulation visuals. In the end, were going to find out all this shit is being paid with our tax dollars. Its either tax dollars via BS off the books congress fund or a way to laundry illegal money, payoffs.  Nobody would ever invest a dime in that shit expecting return.

            </a>
            and wishing you could get to Comet Ping Pong for one of those awesome Heavy Breathing shows...Maybe you'd go see a Boys II Gentlemen show instead

             https://www.facebook.com/boys2gentlemen/?fref=ts

              Every musician who ever played there or every customer who ever went there is not part of this.  You claim it's odd.  Why?  Because he's playing a club?  He seems to also played other DC performance places:
The Arlington Cinema Drafthouse
The 9:30 Club
The DC Improv
             </p>
             <p>
              This is guy is a popular kids perfromer in Washington DC. What's wierd?  That he's played parties at The White House and embassies and influential places?
             </p>
             <p>
              That's because he is a kid's performer in Washington, DC.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's like if you were the top cupcake baker in Washington, DC, you would important customers too.   Or if you were the top plumber.

            Keep repeating this and he might realize that there's a real chance it will happen, and he might turn states witness! Cuz the noise isn't stopping, all the paid shills aren't working. The dots are still being connected and evidence dug up.... seriously. He's got what two weeks before shit could get REAL nasty! And if I was a Saudi Puppet master I'd be lining up some wetworks on a little pizza boy, no matter how much moolah he cleans through art!! THINK ABOUT IT JAMES!! I'd pull a Braverman and call the FBI like NOW!!!

             He's dead meat already, but I wouldn't count on him turning out a whistleblower, he's already cornered on every side, he's threatening people's families because his own family is threatened, but the reality is that there's nothing he can do to stop this

              I think he's just a tiny little player. To the elite, James is very expendable.

              If I were him, I'd be headed to the Trump Tower and asking to be put in Witness protection with Eric Braverman asap.

               No. 49 is a fairly lofty area; if you figure the higher you go is based on the quality of your blackmail/leverage, #49's pretty good.

               I think James is going to "commit suicide" from all the pizzagate "stress".

               They have certainly been trying to clean up their astronomical errors. They realize they are being monitored by more eyes than the original Silk Road website.

               James feels more heat from this, than from his average butt poundings.

             It's not hard to archive, guys. Copy the web address and paste it in the bar at archive.is. I'm not sure what the plan is if that site stops working. I archived the reviews:
