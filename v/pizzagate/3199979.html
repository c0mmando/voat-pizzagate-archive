              Is there any actual evidence Kelly is "Jesuit"? Attending a Jesuit school does not make someone Jesuit, you know. Most people who attend Jesuit schools aren't even Catholic. Especially Jesuit law schools. You would need to see evidence of him being involved in an Ignatian spirituality group, or donating big money to some Jesuit Social Justice operation of some kind to make a claim like that believable.

              This is absolutely true -- if by "Catholic Church" you are referring to the scrim of bureaucrats and clerics that ride atop the millions of folks who make up the Church. I have never met a Catholic
              <em>
               person
              </em>
              who supports open borders. As the mainstream secular and Catholic media lose their ability to whitewash the truth, those folks are going to get
              <em>
               very

              angry.

              It will be interesting to see what Kelly does...or doesn't do.

               I met Kirstjen Nielsen, President Donald Trump’s recently installed secretary of Homeland Security, in the Fall of 1990. We were both freshman attending Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service, a Jesuit institution built on the foundation of the science of diplomacy, global understanding and cross-cultural sensitivity. At Georgetown, Nielsen always identified as a Republican, but more of the Bob Dole ilk—moderate, thoughtful and considered. She was an avowed internationalist—the free trade, open borders kind
              </p>
              <p>
               Why are Jesuit educated politicians in control of border security when Jesuits are against National Borders?

              <blockquote>

                Why wouldn't someone who knows the bloody history and murderous, tyrannical doctrines of the Jesuits and of Rome find alarming that many of the important positions in government, finance, defense and military are headed by Jesuit-alumni and Roman Catholics who by their own religion are devoted to the pope, a foreign monarch? The United States historically was based on anti-Jesuitism and anti-Popery.
               </p>
               <p>
                These people are coadjutor Jesuits; "Jesuits of the Short Robe," as the French called them.
               </p>
               <p>
                Notice in this case too that this man, John Kelly has attended the National Defense University which openly displays as its logo the crossed papal keys with the silver temporal power key being replaced with a silver sword; the pope's spiritual and temporal powers also being referred to as his "two swords." National Defense University is one of the Pope's military training institutions. It is also chartered by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and guess who the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is? Fanatical Irish Roman Catholic Jesuit-trained Joseph Dunford; the single highest ranking military person in the country.

                Georgetown University has the number one ranked Foreign Service master's program in the world. If you have a master's degree from there, or from their security studies program, there is no way you are not working for them.

                The logic of this statement is appallingly bad. Georgetown being the number one program would obviously make
                <em>
                 anyone
                </em>
                interested in a career in foreign service eager to attend the school.
               </p>
               <p>
                Plus, it takes two years to earn a Master's degree...but between 8 and 17 years to become a Jesuit (the shorter end being a lay "Brother" aka "coadjutor Jesuits")...so, it's barely a
                <em>
                 start
                </em>
                . I found that information
                <a href="https://www.thetorchbc.com/2015/04/28/catholicism-101-how-to-become-a-jesuit/">
                 here
                </a>
                . Is there any actual evidence any of these people have made the vows required for either lay or ordained Jesuit state? (S.J. after their name?)
               </p>
               <p>
                And how does having a degree from a school mean "you're working for" the school, or the religion of the school's founders? Does that mean if you graduate from Harvard you're now working for the Unitarians, since it was a seminary for them? Or if from Yale you work for the Puritans?
               </p>
               <p>
                The majority of students at Georgetown are not even Catholic, let alone "Jesuit". Nor are there more than a handful of Jesuits even teaching there, and I don't think any who run it. In fact, it gets criticized frequently because it calls itself Catholic but doesn't really teach much, if any Catholicism.

                 I agree that the statement is unsupported, to expand upon it is a huge rabbit hole, and the basis of the entire subreddit, of which said poster is the main moderator and poster. His posts are incredibly well sourced and factual with primary citations from Church historians (both Catholic and Protestant)
                </p>
                <p>
                 His main thesis is the Catholic Church is at the top of the conspiracy hierarchy and was the first "secret society/hierarchy" to establish the cells/organizations/movements/subversive agents/fronts to bring down enemies of the church.

                 It doesn't, nor is the average Catholic/Jesuit necessarily involved. However, if you look into the history of Jesuit order, its purpose, its oath, its historical expulsions, its whistleblowers, its messaging, and its overall hyper-importance w/in the political system, a trend emerges. They are a psychologically subversive military wing of the Catholic Church motivated purely by will-to-power.

                 I agree, but I also don't consider Catholicism Christianity. Catholicism is a Ritualized Cult off-shoot of Christianity, which has historically watered down/ supplanted the Bible with a living prophet which can change the rules. Catholicism is inherently morally relativist.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Jesuits are just the furthest left, and natural extension of Catholic philosophy. So I think Georgetown is as Catholic as they get.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And this isn't to say there aren't Conservative Christian Catholics who I want to Ally with. I just think their Pope is the Anti-Christ.

                   , did I summarize your thesis accurately?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   While I don't share Veritas' political sympathies, he has been influential in my understanding of the Jesuit order. His subreddit is THE COMPENDIUM for online info about the order.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   And I say all of this as a former student of a Jesuit institution. In retrospect, the social programming is obvious, but I was a good little commie-catholic parroting the "Social Justice"  memes
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I also have first hand seen the good-ol-boy networks protect teachers, vilify accusers, and squash stories of sexual abuse. The mayor of my city attended the same school, his sister is the "secret" legal counsel for the school
We are given special "diplomas" the size of ID cards to put behind out drivers license in case we're pulled over (the police chief/many in the department are graduates, all funerals are held in the on campus chapel)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I blew the whistle, anonymously, to substantiate an accuser. The mainstream network affiliated syndicate assigned a reporter to "investigate" who herself had been educated at a Jesuit University in the same district.

                    Thanks for the praise and reminding me of some of my old posts. I made a new meme from this (below). By the way, the downvotes in my subverse are because a user falsely accused my of farming scp/ccp in a top comment of a front page thread. It got brigaded and now I am unable to post more than a couple times/day. That has hindered me from backing up the information on my subreddit to that subverse.

                      The Jesuits gained control of the Catholic Church in 1814. The Catholic Church has always been a false religion which has wielded secret supranational influence on the world.

                      This isn't "retarded". A big point of contention between Catholics and Protestants centers over which scriptures are canon. The Catholic Bible has 5 additional books, that Protestants don't consider inspired by God.

                       No, that is only a big point of contention for Protestants, because they are ignorant of history. Catholics set the canon of Scripture, both Old and New Testament, by the end of the 4th century. The Catholic Church existed several hundred years before Scripture was gathered together formally. This is historical fact, noted in documents at the time which are still in existence. When I have more time and no houseguests, I will dig up the links for this, if you want. My experience is, though, that people who accept black propaganda uncritically don't really want to see the evidence.

                        Are you Catholic Vindicator? To say that it's only the Protestants that care about the canon dispute, because they are "ignorant of history" is another ad-hominem and appeal to authority.

                        Biblical Canon was established in 382 by the Catholic Church. The Protestants rightfully recognized the logical inconsistencies created by the Apocrypha.

                        Here are some examples. The implications of these theologies allow the Catholic Church to justify it's position and attempts for temporal control. (Specifically the book of Tobit led to the selling of indulgences)

                       <p>
                        Moreover, Protestants accurately note that none of the apocryphal books are referenced in the New Testament.

                       <p>
                        Theological/logical inconsistencies w/in the Canon motivated the Protestants to remove 7 books. It had nothing to do with "ignorance" of history. Protestantism was very philosophical/intellectual in it's formation.

                        I'd be happy to see evidence,  no rush if you're entertaining, but to call Protestantism's genuine concerns about catholicism "black propoganda" is pretty bombastic
