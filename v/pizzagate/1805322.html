            They are being acquired, adapted and fortified by the US Government for some form of holding/processing centre. Loads of film evidence on YT  Pretty worrying when you look into it closely.  E.g.:

            Ok...unless I have forgotten how to use Goog earth...some of these locations are vacant fields. There isn't anything there and there's no way they would tear these facilities down that fast.  Other's, when you try and go from Satellite (where you can see a building) to street view, the building is gone.  Kid you not.  It's weird. I started with some in Alabama, then went to one in Georgia and then Kansas. Has anyone else tried to look at these facilities? Granted I only tried like 5-6 but still strange.

             Sometimes the tag is in the wrong spot.  ie... check down the street for big bldgs.  I try to stay away from Google.  Try (I know it is old lol) Map Quest.  I may take a road trip this weekend to one in my state.  If you do this, pick one in a very rural area.  I'm pretty sure they would not be so silly as to put a refugee holding area in a very populated area.

              I have to use Goog maps a lot for work locating business. I checked up and down the streets and went N,S,E,W...nothing on some. And the areas were very rural. Like, country, farms...basically, nothing. It was strange. Going to look more this weekend.
             </p>
             <p>
              Some where obvious it was a "smaller" Walmart yet when you go to some street views, they would like disappear. You couldn't see them. One had a sign in front that rented trailers but the name of the company was blurred out. I need to remember which one so I can take a pic of it. Couldn't do much at work besides look a little here and there.

            I will check out his info when I have time but when you throw stuff out there w/out saying why (and on here for only 8 days), the actual shill troll looked like you. Not calling you that per say, just saying that's how it appears that way.

            I bet g4s is providing security at the Walmarts that house these people.  G4s is heavily involved in these trafficking networks and the transport of people.

            i'm in australia and my daughters boyfriend works on manus detention centre on papua new guinea he is ex army and is trained to deal with battle type situations but even he is struggling with the conditions there with the refugees. recently mainstream media reported ' shots fired on manus ' i did a search and google blamed some drunken soldiers. duck duck go had an abc story closer to the truth. .... the real story is 3 refugee males stole a child belonging to one of the military on the base and raped them. they did it they said because their lunch was late and they had been wronged. the parents belonged to the navy base so the navy men went to the camp and demanded the 3 child rapists to be put in their custody. the detention centre declined to hand them over so the navy went in with guns blazing. it turned into live battle. people working there without previous military experience have been sent home with ptsd. my daughters partner watched his mate get his head crushed with a rock. this just happened and the media white washed it. just an insight into politics and that which the public are not made aware of. activists in australia campaign tirelessly for the release of the refugees on manus. my daughter said they receive the best food, medical attention etc. but still find ways to complain and be ungrateful.

            Remember all the unaccompanied children from Central America that swarmed the border awhile back? I remember an article about a two year old found wandering by herself after coyotes ditched her right by the Texas border. Never heard definitively what happened to all the kids (50,000 give or take). Are these maybe the refugees they are referring to or brought from overseas?

             Unlikely.  That wave told stories of why thy came, they were invited, it was pointed in the local papers and such to come to America.  By who?  Never heard anyone investigate why.

             Holy shit..that's a LOT of stores. I saw 4 Sam's Clubs too which are also huge buildings. I assume, it would be easy with these addresses to GoOg Le earth them, see if any are near railroads too. As well as, keep an eye on them if they are getting sold and reopened as anything else.
            </p>
            <p>
             I assume The Waltons/Walmart own their own buildings, correct? There should be a way to search via property records as to who owns the land/buildings.

              I wouldn't fixate too much on railroads. True that the children could be transported by freight train, but just as easily by van, bus, etc. It would be time consuming, but if there are any stores near you that could be viable locations for trafficking, it might be fruitful to stock up on coffee, park discreetly nearby, and watch the place all night long. Have a video camera (with IR/low light filming capability) close at hand. They might move the kids in daylight hours, but getting them in/out of buildings probably takes place when people are least likely to see anything-- i.e., under cover of darkness.

               Believe it or not, no Walmart closings by me but I was thinking the same thing.  I only thought railroads because the "way out there in my mind" was FEMA camps for the future. Very out there, I know, but always a concern specifically with so much civil unrest.

                Anymore, nothing seems "out there" to me. And I'm not discounting the possibility of them using trains, but they would still have to lead the children to/from the train at the start point and at the destination. The more time they're out in the open, the more likely they'll be spotted. The condition of the children might tip off passersby if the children appear to be drugged, disheveled, crying, scared, etc. Each location they use will probably be unique in order fit their agenda, but there will also be overlaps. For instance, a way in/out that is not visible to most traffic such as a back entrance (almost any building anywhere will have a back entrance). It's probably going to be a location with low traffic so that if a child starts screaming, it doesn't bring attention. What we need is someone in the know to buy some balls and give us more specific information such as city, building description, etc. The overly generalized information from Anon5 does not bolster their credibility.

              Potential network. IF the theory holds true, I wonder how many stores it involves. I think many more of the trafficked children end up in Deep Underground Military Bases (DUMBs) either as temporary holding places, underground transportation via the tunnels, and/or slave workers for those who are stationed in the DUMBs. But above ground holding places are where they're more likely to be spotted by everyday citizens. If we raise awareness about child trafficking in general, people would be more inclined to report what they see rather than assume it's a group of kids on an authorized school outing or whatever cover story they're told.

                Yeah. Forgot about that. I just did a search on "Walmart tunnels" and it came up with all kinds of stuff. I think tunnels are key to pedogate. Like rats, the child rapists and Satanic worshippers who perform child sacrifices use tunnels to travel, hide, and imprison the children. They live in the darkness, symbolically and literally.

            This must be addressed immediately.  As if we have not had enough scary stuff, this is  frightening for us and the refugees. Yes we must have addresses and hey, I thought we were going to pull out of the UN That needs to happen asap.  Can someone tweet Sessions? Who is head of Immigration Dept
