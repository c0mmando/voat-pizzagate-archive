<p>In the Pizzacult research that leaded to Domino Sugar in Baltimore we found so many clues and disturbing links that something is very wrong with Baltimore city.</p>
<p>After seeing The Keepers (Baltimore), a few things came to mind: </p>
<p>(Take a look add my Pizzacult submissions Part 1, 2, 3)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pizzacult, Part 1 | Comet Ping Pong | Prince Rama | Naked baby sword ritual | Chicken sacrifice | (Blood) rituals | Occult symbolism | Spirals | Pizza | Prince Rama with Heavy Breathing voice box!!!</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1902985">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1902985</a> (+60)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pizzacult Part 2 | Multipurpose, dubious buildings | Olsen twins: &quot;Selling brother&quot; | Pandas | Pizzas | Spirals | Pizzacult Bands | Pedophilia | Kid, &quot;Sock dick&quot; | Dubious one eye symbolism &amp; more!</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1907161">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1907161</a> (+42)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pizzacult part 3 | New Pedo-Performance artist: Domino = Dominate | Beyonce and Jay-z visited her dubious art piece | Domino\'s with trafficking history | Spirals | Friends of Marina Abramovic | &amp;more!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Quick intro to the Pizzacult research parts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Baltimore is a nest for disturbing pizzacult bands!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dubious places like &quot;Comet pong pong&quot; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ritual art piece made by (pedo) artist inside DOMINO sugar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jay z and Beyonce visited domino sugar Kara Walker art (and they could have stayed until the evening an dinner there)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Domino sugar BALTIMORE has huge history of slavery (human trafficking)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Domino sugar and the money behind it is huge, BIG donations to the Clintons !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kara Walker made disturbing baby slavery art, and made a giant naked sphinx slave in the soon to be demolished (part of the) sugar factory </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clinton ship vessel got raided in Baltimore&quot; (not debunked)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Relation to The Keepers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keepers shows a shot of one of the disturbing party places found in the Pizzacult research.  in the first episode (and episode 4 or 5): name of the place METRO GALLERY  (you can recognize it red big square add on the wall same as Metro gallery on google maps  same advertisement same dubious building)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The keepers research office face with the window to METRO GALLERY (with giant dubious trafficking sign!) and disturbing Pizzacult bands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The womans want to find the bigger ring, in my opinion and research it points out it could be all 
around them, and literally in front of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &quot;father&quot; stayed and worked in multiple places some just 10 mins from Domino sugar !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They show Domino Sugar sign more than once </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strange side note, in the keepers is not even one shot of &quot;boh&quot; Baltimore\'s one eyed mascot (Boh comes from Bohemian) man head with spiral hair and one eye is prominently displayed i the city at least on 1 building (and 2 in the past, before 2015) they even have Boh beer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in The Pizzacult research Baltimore pedo artsit Kara walker interpreters Domino as Dominate, The Keepers (Baltimore) documentary mentions SKIPPY !!!    Two possible references to Podesta emails from two different sources </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Skippy had a mustache, pics of young John Podesta have been found with mustache!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Keepers shows part of Baltimore\'s dark history</p>
<p>The Pizzacult research parts shows whats going on there, at this moment of time</p>
<p>The Pizzacult research leaded to Domino sugar, the place that has written the history of early Human trafficking (/slavery)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First the sugar was only for the rich, then they decided sugar should not be exclusive but a necessity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the ban on slavery, they searched for other ways to facilitate there customers with...? </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big ring with a looooong history ?</p>
<p>(video) Also the Baltimore ACORN housing company that helps a pimp and underage prostitute trough suggestion she is doing performance art shows there is something wrong in that city !!! </p>
<p>Traveling from Baltimore to Washington would take under 1 hour</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
<p>Did Podesta,JA,etc Own any property in Baltimore ?</p>
<p>have any written connections to Baltimore </p>
<p>Any connections to the mentioned church ?</p>
<p>Any other things we can research ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ps: The research woman\'s in the Keepers are amazing! </p>
<p>Ps just took a second look at the add on the wall that can be seen from the Keepers office, before i think less interesting but on second inspection it also shows a interesting symbol a RED SPIRAL in the noise of a man (one more spiral in Baltimore one more possible symbol that doesn\'t do them any good. you need to see this with google street view &quot;metro gallery&quot; Baltimore, the building and surrounding area is filled with symbolism </p>
<p>One i didn\'t mention before is on the single entrance to the parking at the back of Metro gallery, a small head (baby?) with 3 pentagrams above it! 
(On streetview dont forget change the date of the things you view to see older things)</p>',
