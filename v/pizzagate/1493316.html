I noticed it yesterday when i was having a discussion with someone, and he brought up a New York Times article that &quot;debunked&quot; pizzagate, I then told them about Mark Thompson and his past, in a pretty lengthy post, and noticed he wasnt commenting..I asked him why, and he said that he didnt see the comment...
So I hopped on the TOR browser (for anonymity) and checked to see what comments WERE actually visible to the public, and only a very minimal amount of them were visible, basically just enough comments were showing to make it seem like i was talking nonsense..
I took a screenshot of what the view was on the TOR browser (public view), and what was visible from my normal browser and account

It honestly seems like someone is screening each of my comments and deeming it acceptable or not, it sounds crazy i know...its driving ME crazy.</p>

            Could it just be that the person that uploaded the video is deleting your comments?
            <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/m.wikihow.com/Delete-Comments-on-YouTube%3Famp%3D1?client=safari">
             How to delete comments on a video
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree especially with one particular comment that was deleted that it couldn't have been an automated removal. Also there was a YouTube Herod AMA on that old site we went to that they claimed all flagging of videos has to be approved by YouTube staff. But this offers a realistic explanation that the person or people that moderate the channel that posted the video are censoring you.

             I really doubt that is it, i think its more than a coincdence whenever i type more or less, the same types of comments, and those are  the once being censored, i know its not just the video/channel host.
For example, there are a couple copy/pastes that i have, that gets hidden from view on every video i post it on, it simply wont let me post it

            .  If you find a post in a different political sub that's not Hillary friendly and check the (other submissions) tab, you it won't show any posted in

             r/politics

            but if you try to post it there it brings you to a post that exists but is invisible elsewhere and the user isn't deleted but not found so you can't see their history. Censorship on the DL. So far when I post there I get immediately downvoted to oblivion and rude remarks implying I'm stupid so I'm still visible.

            Yup and i've been getting messages saying they were going to ban my account. Lol. Keep going. They lose in the end. Truth is rapidly unfolding around the world. We've been lied to, and everyone is waking up. It's a beautiful time to be alive. From Obama's forged birth certificate, to South Koreans revolting in the streets by the millions, the Mandela Effect, finding pieces of truth everyday and it all ties in.

            I can confirm this is happening as it is happening with my own comments as well, but to be completely fair, I'm not entirely sure whether this is censorship, a fuckup, or a mixture of both. Comments on YouTube are notoriously buggy and unreliable, sometimes perfectly innocuous comments disappear and then eventually reappear, I've even witnessed an entire comment thread of maybe twenty comments and several participants that was perfectly visible from the notification dropdown, but, except for the starter comment, was nonexistent in the comment section below the video.

              This kind of jumping to conclusions without evidence is what helps publicly discredit the entire operation, so let's not do that. We don't know if it's censorship. The fact that another user (
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/tjarco">
               @tjarco
              </a>
              ) has reported seeing all of the comments by OP, combined with the other fact that this happens often with completely innocuous comments as well, suggests it probably isn't.

               Well, i asked tjarco is he could so politely go the this video in this link and count to see how many replies i have to gosaints2345 comment, he doesnt seem to be here at the moment and i really want to get to the bottom of this..
It appears to me that they have only made the uninformative posts to be visible to the public, there a few certain comments that i tried to post on MULTIPLE occasions on different videos, but they are never visible to the public

               </a>
               Its on the first page, just scroll down a bit and could you please tell me how many replies of mine are appearing to gosaint2345? 
Would be very helpful for me..and the sooner i get to the bottom of this the sooner ill shut up about it

                 Okay, so I made a new google account finally..The first 2 test posts went through fine, I checked TOR browser no less than a minute later, and they were appearing where the should be, like normal.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Then i go to try and post the dreaded comment I've been trying to post for the past 2 days, and sure enough it was censored....Maybe they are just censoring certain links from being posted? I posted it once and it didn't go through, but i will try again later on a different video, i just want to give it time to avoid being flagged for spamming..
                </p>
                <p>
                 This is one of the post's it just will NOT let me post anywhere on youtube..anyone else want to give it a try?

                  Your comment is being caught by a preconfigured filter. Have you tried posting it without the link? If it goes through, you will know that this particular video you're trying to link to is on a blacklist (which, given its title, is more than likely), and then you can try circumventing the algorithm by posting just the video ID (53qYAWE8_kE), broken up into two pieces, explained. (E.g., "For more details, watch the video with the ID
                  <em>
                   53qYA
                  </em>
                  combined with
                  <em>
                   WE8_kE
                  </em>
                  – this is the only way I can post it as the link is filtered out every time.")

            Shadow Comment Censorship has been around for about 5 years now.
           </p>
           <p>
            Before hand it worked off of two methods.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              Spam filter URL rules.  If there is a URL in the description that's been put on the naughty list then the whole post is removed.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Word Combo rules.  Specific sets of two words used together and side by side  (they may have busted it out to three) get a specific score attached to them.  When adding up the total score of the post, if it goes over a limit then the comment is shadow dumped.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            But, now they have the new final solution (did that on purpose).  They are game-a-fying censorship with Youtube Hero's.  It's retarded beyond all belief, and the perfect place for censorship nazi's.

            I did look into this yesterday, thing is when I looked for your comments on the Colbert video I was able to find all of them. I was suspecting you were trolling or harrassing people, because more than half of comments on the video we're pro PG so I wondered what made you so special to ban. Anyway I clicked on one of your posted links, which seemed fine. No trolling/harassment, only the sheer volume of your comments could be questioned, maybe they spam-marked you. But when I reloaded the page and tried to search for your comment again, it was removed from the original position! Untill I scrolled down and down and down and there it was again. I notice that Youtube randomly orders the comments, so two of your comments that were below eachother, weren't when I refreshed the page. Still not sure what to make of this. It's hard to support that they are censoring, because the comments I could find weren't removed, they were just moved. If this is a common thing for Youtube comments? I honestly don't know.

              One of which I don't agree with: "I'm sure it it a violation to censor people who are simply speaking the truth, I'm not preaching hate, or abuse or anything remotely similar."
             </p>
             <p>
              It's not truth now we have policy making against FAKE-NEWS. It's your opinion. If that is being censored, your freedom to openly question things. Than that is evidence. I suspect you left more comments, I'm wondering what they stated.

               Yeah i guess i forgot, its okay for the mainstream to have their opinion on what the "truth" is, and spread their opinion to millions of people, but I'm not alloud to state what i feel is the truth in a youtube comment?  (rhetoric question...not to you..)
              </p>
              <p>
               This is what i typed out.
              </p>
              <p>
               "I don't believe pizzagate is fake at all, what i do believe, is that there is currently a major attempt by our government to make it APPEAR that pizzagate is fake
              </p>
              <p>
               But they aren't just trying to discredit pizzagate, they are also trying to find a way to take down the alternative media sites...
              </p>
              <p>
               They're going to try and find a way to link pizzagate with the russians, which will in turn be cause enough to shut down the websites that are supporting the pizzagate hunt, because it it all based on "russian disinfo"..
              </p>
              <p>
               I dont know if you guys heard, but they recently passed a bill in senate, stating that if anyone is in "Cahoots" with the russian, so to speak, they have the right to take authoritative action against you, whatever that may be...

               I also get censored everytime time i try to post a link to this video (

               ) I made a new account since my old account appears to be shadowbanned, and I can comment normally with it, but i tried posing a link to that video and it was hidden from view once again

             It is common. The ordering of starter comments varies from time to time, and depends on many factors I believe, the exact algorithm is unknown. This happens on every video.
