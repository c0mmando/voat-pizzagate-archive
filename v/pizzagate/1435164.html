<p>(Back Story)
I am an English major at the University of Houston, but I am also dyslexic so it can be tough at times. I only signed up for one class from the honors college, and the rest were just standard college classes. I also go to college with my mother and my sister, so we all take the same classes which means we have a small built in study group.</p>
<p>As the title says, it was the honors college class I found odd comments in. But before I can explain what those odd comments were I should explain the class. When I signed up for the class it was describe as, &quot;early contemporary American literature,&quot; so the class could be really about anything around/after world war two. However, upon showing up to class on the first day I soon found out that the class is only going to be talking about LOVE, which I was fine with at first. <a href="http://sli.mg/a/A5qZVw"><strong>Here is a link to the syllabus of the class</strong></a>, it is a pretty standard syllabus until you start reading some of the names for the stories the class is assigned to read around, and after the midterm. I withdrew from that class after the midterm because I was tired of how the class was being run, and the stories we were reading. However, my sister and mother stayed in the class, and now they regret not dropping the class. I have gotten most of my info from them after I dropped the class/overheard the stories they were reading.</p>
<p>Here is a brief description of each story that the Professor loved, and could not get enough of. </p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Anne Carson: Autobiography of Red,</strong>&quot; is about how a young boy who gets raped by his older brother, and is trying to find his way in life, but cant because of what happened to him in the past. The professor liked this story, but never told the class why. The only thing he ended up talking about was how he almost burned down a forest when he was in Boy Scouts. </p>
<p>Snow White, and this is not the Snow White Disney made. This is &quot;<strong>Donald Barthelme: Snow White</strong>&quot;, which can be summarized to seven dwarfs having sex with a lady all at once. This story the TA really liked.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Phillip Roth, The dying Animal</strong>&quot; is a story about how a man forces himself on to a goat and has sex with it, and the story ends with the goat getting killed by the dudes wife after she finds out that he has been fucking it. - The professor LOVED this story he kept saying that the goat should have not died, and that there was nothing wrong with what the dude was doing because the goat wanted it.</p>
<p>The professors and the TA comments about this next story is what pissed me off. It was the <strong>Stanley Kubrik</strong> movie called, <strong>Lolita</strong>, which is based on the novel called <strong>Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov</strong>. Yes the name of the movie and novel are called lolita, and is it about a man having sex with a underage girl. Now in the movie the girl was 16 instead of 12 like how she was in the book, but the dude was still middle aged. I movie itself tried to portray the man as being seduced by the underage girl, but in the book he rapes her. Now onto the comments the professor and his TA made.</p>
<p>These are only some of the stories the class had to read, on top of also having to read <em>Lapham\'s Quarterly -- Volume II, Number I / Winter 2009 -- Eros</em> book, which had stories of sex with children, and defending such acts. When those stories came up for discussion most of the women in the class insisted that we skip them because they did not want to go back over what was talked about in them, and I don\'t blame them for not wanting to.</p>
<p><strong>The professor said, &quot;that it was alright that a 40+ year old man had sex with a underage girl because she seduced him.&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TA said, &quot;it is a shame that such things are frowned upon.&quot; the things he was referring to was sex with children.</strong></p>
<p>Originally, mine mind was blew away after hearing what they said, but after all the recent stuff that you all have uncovered it does not surprise me that people could say such a thing without thinking what they are saying is wrong. But then I had a thought and it is a big what if, but what if this is one of the way these stick people try and brainwash people into think that pedophilia is perfectly alright. </p>
<p>The professors name is <strong>William Monroe</strong> which is the dean of the honors college at UH, and the TA name is <strong>Corey Kendrink</strong> which Kendrink is a bit crazy and attempted to kill himself in the middle of class one day, but that is a story for another time. I really wish I could be making this shit up. But I am not.</p>
<p>I also reported this to the head of UH and Dean Monroe\'s superiors but I was told to take it up with Monroe himself. Maybe I am overreacting to what they said, but I found it odd that they had us read this shit all semester long and at the end of the semester they make such statements like what I already posted.</p>
<p>I most definitely think we should be looking into people who also promote pedophilia in written works as well as movies, and see how they link back to everything else.</p>',

            the end goal of the left is legalisimg pedophilia we see this agenda leak all the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ever argued about islam and the Prophet being a pedo to leftists?
           </p>
           <p>
            Years of being influenced to believe that everything is subjective and moral relativism being there view leabve the door open for normies to accept pedophilia.
           </p>
           <p>
            This could be one reason why they are trying to import islam, if you change your society enough that a significant portion support pedophilia AKA muslims then everyone will have to see pedophilia as being ok.

             <p>
              The other story starts at the third week of class when the TA walks in and say that he is not feeling to well today, and the class asked why? The TA replied with,"oh I went 38 hours without drinking anything because I wanted to see how it would feel like to die of dehydration."
             </p>
             <p>
              The class started asking him why he would even want to do that, and all he said was, "I am getting info for a book I am going to write." Shortly after the midterm some of the women in the class were telling the TA and the professor during class how they are teaching the class was all wrong, and that the stories that we have been reading really had nothing to do with love and more to do with "manic pixie dream girls."
             </p>
             <p>
              Which the TA's way of trying to stop them from talking was to attempt to swallow his wedding ring in the middle of the class, but he kept failing. At the end of the class the TA jumped up out of his seat and yelled, "I did it, I finally did it." This confused most of the people in the class that did not notice what the TA had been attempting to do the whole time in class. Within seconds of the TA yelling what he did the TA started choking on his wedding ring, which he eventually coughed up. The response from the people around the TA at the time was, "What the hell did I just see?."
             </p>
             <p>
              After that I had decided to drop the class, so the rest of the info I have is because my sister and mother are still in the class. About a week later the TA did not show up for class, and the professor said the TA had to see a doctor because the TA started to swell up. When the TA finally returned to class he said that it was because he ate a, "radioactive carrot," which is why he had to go see a doctor. Since that event, the TA has not been wearing his wedding ring, and most of the class does not buy his story of him eating a radioactive carrot.

              Now you know the other story.
