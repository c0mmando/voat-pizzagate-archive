            You are wrong. "Q said the opposite." "Both are very contradicting."
           </p>
           <p>
            What Q said about Reagan is not the 'opposite', because Q doesn't champion Reagan whatsoever, only bringing him up as mention of outsider presidents (Whom Q then directly said (((they))) also bribed/blackmailed...). Q brings up Reagan up in comparison to JFK not due to the intentions of both (plain to see, heart on whose sleeve?), but due to the fact that they were both not explicitly 'on the team'.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is misleading of you to claim that what Q said is "very contradicting".

            Q is not infallible. Reagan used mind fractured Presidential Models, although he may not have been as sadistic as some. He was a product of Pedowood. Who knows what he experienced and was made to do.

            "For decades, the GOP incorporated Third Reich alumni into its ethnic outreach organization. This political alliance culminated in the Reagan regime. The lists of personnel from which Reagan made his appointments was drawn up by Helene von Damm, a protege of Otto von Bolschwing. (Mr. Emory played a small role in the breaking of the original San Jose Mercury story in 1981, along with his late, dear friend Mae Brussell.)"

            Brice Taylor was a mkultra presidential model given to Ronald Reagan. In her book, Thanks for the Memories , she says she had a baby with Reagan. Queen took the baby with the explanation for the good of the world. Brice Taylor in her younger photos and Prince Andrew look remarkably similar. They both have a bright unique look. He does not look like any of the rest of his family. Brice Taylor, I gather from her book, was very very special. She made speeches at Universities in the California state system. Henry Kissinger was her handler. There was talk in the newspaper or magazine Scallywag in GB that Andrew was not Phillip's son. There was speculation as to who was the father.

            I was locked out of my older accounts with ratings[oh well] and therefor cannot post the question. I'm looking for a picture of Hillary that she herself posted in 2017 I think, maybe 2018, that shows her sitting at a table with three other women and they are drinking probably wine. I swear one of the ladies with her is Laura Silsby and the picture seems to be scrubbed. Thanks. This is my one post allowed today. Yay.

            I don't see  anywhere in those 3 q posts that says Reagan was a hero. I see something about being different from all the other presidents except Trump and JFK. That doesn't mean RR is a hero and it doesn't mean Q is calling RR a hero either.

            Stop believing everything q anon tells you. Reagan was tied to the Franklin case years ago, was at Bohemian Grove and into the occult along with his wife Nancy who could never make a decision without consulting astrology and horoscopes and she racked up a shit ton of tax payer money doing so. Nothing about this family was good.

            Cathy O'Brien said the same thing about Reagan.  There's also a pictire of Reagan at Bohemian Grove from the late 50s. Reagan was most definitely part of the cabal.

             I saw a pic of RR at Bohemian Grove sitting outside at a table. I may still have it too.
            </p>
            <p>
             Q has always confused me on this, because I remember the scandal at the White House where they were paying male prostitutes for sex.
            </p>
            <p>
             Q also uses his appeasement speech too.
            </p>
            <p>
             I heard two other people chatting saying that DJT helped RR with pretending not to remember anything by way of faking Alzheimer's disease.

             Now time for NOT SO FUN FACTS:

            <p>
             Stephan halper whom looks like the Penguin from Batman that smokes crack (true story on drugs) rigged the1980's Election too, so this isnt his first time at the rodeo. Dont forget GHWB was Vice President to RR who's biggest donor to him had a son named John Hinkley Jr.
            </p>
            <p>
             Although he didnt die, it was clearly a shot across his bow &amp; I am sure RR knew this anyways.

            Brice Taylor also claimed she gave birth to a baby boy that had been fathered by Reagan.  Allegedly it was Queen Elizabeth, who was interested in breeding and bloodlines, who suggested the pregnancy.  Allegedly that baby was born on a private jet flying to England and taken from her, Brice (the mother).

             Brice Taylor and Prince Andrew have a strong resemblance. They have a unique look .....unmistakable if you know what you are looking for. Most noticeable in their younger photos before they put on a little weight.

             In the book, Thanks for the Memories , Brice Taylor sounds very balanced. Much more so to me than Cathy O'Brian. Another woman who had mkultra mind control and torture done to her.

               If it wasn't nothing, why would I talk about it on unsecure comms with a complete stranger?
              </p>
              <p>
               Do you even OPSEC, bro?
              </p>
              <p>
               The point is, you believe in a false god/prophet that amounts to pathetic hope porn and disables you.

               It's like the man who keeps turning boats down during the flood as they show up to save him "God is going to save me" he says. The man drowns. In heaven he says to St. Peter, "Hey what the hell. Why didn't you save me." to which he replies "What are you talking about, I sent 3 boats and you turned them all down".

               Get off your asses. Thoughts and prayers are useless in this war.

            I don’t understand are you saying neither of the claims are true?  I have always believed the Washington Times article. After all it was immediately pulled. We have had Bush Sr accusations as well. Why not Reagan.

             Brice Taylor was given to Reagan.......he lent her out but was nicer to her than a lot of other politicians . Bob Byrd was horrible and well as the Vermont senator who always seems drunk. Leahy or something like that. She said he had a very feminine bedroom. In the book, Thanks for the Memories.

              Must be Patrick Leahy. Oh dear. Could be he was nicer to her because he had an extremely hard father. But why her and not others. Makes you wonder.

              Whew! Thanks. So sad what those Children experienced at the hands of our country’s leaders no less. This really has been swept under the rug and I am sure those that were instrumental in scuttling it are happy as can be. Namely Muller and as I have lately read, Barr. Sr. Camp put his life on the line in the name of justice. So sad.

              It is troubling. If I were being an apologist, I'd say it's a Q blind spot. If I were being suspicious, I might say Q is intentionally deceiving, or covering Reagan because their target demographic is Right leaning public who are susceptible to Patriotic nostalgia. The Truth reveals itself eventually, and maybe they must disavow that particular anchor to keep their ship afloat. Good dig.

               You would think people would want the truth, but look at how I'm being downvoted in Great Awakening. I don't care I'll keep searching for the truth.

                I see the down voats, but the people commenting seem to be open, though they have their own weighted opinions. I think you have some support for people checking in to this with an open mind, I believe most people do want to know the Truth.
