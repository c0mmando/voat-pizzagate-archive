            First of all you people are doing some amazing work,i am in my fifties and just not that internet savvy so l am not much help except for support.I may be way off base here and the last thing I want to do is deter from your investigations,has anyone looked into hurricane Katrina,it has all the hallmarks of trafficking,natural disaster,mass confusion,trauma(was there another reason it took so long for help) must have been easy pickings for these sick fucks,maybe too easy and someone got sloppy.Anyway just a thought,Keep up the great work and even if I can't help on the research I'll be there marching when it's time.

            Encouraging abuse victims to step forward would breathe new life into the investigation.  Victims are extremely reluctant to "go public" for obvious reasons.  The current investigation would benefit from an individual such as former victims Cathy O'Brien, Brice Taylor (Susan Ford), David Shurter, et al presenting the facts in an effective manner and publicizing as outlined by the OP.

            I was thinking that someone with project management skills needs to summarize  pg with a mission statement and break down the investigative components into a more manageable action steps. This will help focus certain investigative tracks and maybe identify WHAT specifically would constitute a smoking gun.  Then low level researchers like me can look for info to fill in the investigative holes.

           <p>
            I agree with your conclusion, and I'll explain why:
            <br/>
            I wouldn't say that the pizzagate community is necessarily running out of steam, however, there are only so many things that can be discovered before you start running out of new things and links to discover..
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it is incorrect to have a mentality such as: "We haven't done good enough yet, because we still haven't found the smoking gun yet!", because in reality the pizzagate community has found tons of incredibly good evidence.. But when will it be "good enough"?..
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem isn't pizzagate community, it is the departments (like FBI etc.) in the US government that are acting as the bottleneck right now.. Most people probably define "smoking gun" as a piece of evidence that is so obvious that we could show it to the FBI and the FBI would immediately say "WHOA! We definitely need to investigate that!".. But realistically we have already found tons of crap that should warrant an FBI investigation..
           </p>
           <p>
            So I would postulate that pizzagate community isn't necessarily getting uninterested, but that even if they find smoking gun after smoking gun.......Well, nothing is a smoking gun if you can't really do any thing with it.. It is like playing mario brothers and you find every star coin in the whole game, but the game still tells you "SORRY, that still isn't good enough, I still won't let you win the game"..
            <br/>
            (Note: I am not suggesting that we have found every single piece of evidence concerning pizzagate yet)
           </p>
           <p>
            So, I agree with your conclusion; I think that people that are having a hard time finding any more additional evidence should start to channel some of their energy in to raising pizzagate laterally through social media, and spreading it more and more until it becomes general public knowledge, and then FBI will be forced to make a statement on it, or do some thing about it..
           </p>
           <p>
            Actually that has already been happening.. I mean even steven colbert talked about it on his show.. He tried to say it is fake, but he also unwittingly exposed tons of new people to pizzagate that have never heard about it before.. Any big person or media that is trying to say "this is fake!" is also exposing it to the public more and more.. It is like some one telling you "There is no dead body in my back yard! That is ridiculous!"........Before he told you a dead body wasn't in his yard, you never even thought about it, but now you are starting to wonder about it, and might end up looking in to it your self..
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, if people don't want to just post plain text messages on social media like "pizzagate is real!", you can also make memes about it (which is more fun than just posting text) and post your memes to social media or voat/chans etc..

            I think we should plan for the efficient use of almost 9000 people interested in Pizzagate, so that all leads can be explored and documented. a structure for self-organization needs to be provided so people can put themselves to something they want to work on. media and communication is one branch. various investigation leads is another. organizing info and research another. like any growing organization, you have to help them find their place in the work to be done and grow organically.

            I agree thank you for writing this up it almost reads like a mission statement. I was thinking earlier that a symbol would be useful, the democrats wear a safety pin. Christians a cross. I can't say I have an idea about what should be but a symbol we can all easily wear would go along way for encouragement and Visual recognition for our cause. I am convinced our movement is large enough to be perceived as a real threat by the MSM. I also thought this children that are missing and exploited deserve a candlelight vigil. Much as when we see a child go missing and the public comes out with candles. Thanks for putting this post together we need a long term plan to keep this going. Upvoated you too.

            I think the focus should still be investigation. We need a smoking gun. Plain and simple.
           </p>
           <p>
            Redpilling is important too though! It's just we can only go so far at this point.  I especially like your idea #2. Normies do facebook and the comment section is powerful. Look how the onion took their pizzagate article down after we swarmed the comments!
           </p>
           <p>
            I think we need
            <strong>
             investigative subs. Got a lead you want to follow up on? Make a private sub
            </strong>
            where you and a few comrades can investigate without shills. Report back findings to this sub. I think it would really help us get organized.

             i agree with this 100%. we have enough already in the main sub. breaking this into managable subsections with a specific focus will make it harder for shills. consider if there was a sub dedicated to clinton foundation donors, instead of a thread? I would make voting points unique to that sub, and strict moderation where each thread is a donor and all discussion is focused. no other threads allowed. every week or so someone could summarize and report back to main pizzagate sub.

            We are making gains every day, man. Today was amazing. I can think of about 10 new breakthroughs we had and in much more detail. We found the Pedo watch-tower. Nightcheese's new IG. Fed judge is asking for Hillary's email dumps to be released. And we started the day off with Kanye! Tell you what, brother. Take a break from the computer and recharge by talk out to people about it. You don't necessarily have to be at the front of the pack. We need more marketing.
           </p>
           <p>
            In any case, I hope your passion finds you because the prophecy is real and we can do no wrong. We are the chosen.
