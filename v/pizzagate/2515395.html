<p>Sara also had an affair with the Dalai Lama’s representative in America, Lama Tenzin Dhonden. That lasted for a time, but for reasons unknown, Lama Tenzin broke up with her.</p>
<p>On the rebound, Sara began dating Basit Igtet, a Libyan exile, and native of Benghazi.  Basit’s late father was accused of embezzling millions of dollars from the Qaddafi government and sent to prison. Basit fled to Switzerland and lived in exile for years. He was well mannered, well groomed, articulate and played the part of a well-heeled man, which he wasn’t.</p>
<p>At this emotional time, Sara needed a companion, possibly a husband. She seemed crestfallen at losing her lover, Lama Tenzin. Sometime between the time Lama Tenzin was nearly ending his relationship with Sara and the time she started supporting Basit Igtet, she got pregnant.  Sara was reportedly about three months pregnant when she married Basit on July 15, 2012. Her daughter was born six months later.

<p>Basit Igtet (born 24 September 1970) is a Zurich-based entrepreneur and Libyan national who has founded several companies in various sectors. He became prominent in mid-2011 for his work supporting the Libyan revolution through international lobbying and was consequently appointed as a Special Envoy to the Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) on 4 September 2011
<a href="https://alchetron.com/Basit-Igtet">https://alchetron.com/Basit-Igtet</a></p>
<p>................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</p>
<p>National Transitional Council</p>
<p>was the de facto government of Libya for a period during and after the Libyan Civil War, in which rebel forces overthrew the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya of Muammar Gaddafi</p>
<p>The formation of the NTC was announced in the city of Benghazi on 27 February 2011 with the purpose to act as the &quot;political face of the revolution&quot;. On 5 March 2011, the council issued a statement in which it declared itself to be the &quot;only legitimate body representing the people of Libya and the Libyan state</p>
<p>The council gained international recognition as the legitimate governing authority in Libya[8] and occupied the country\'s seat at the United Nations

<p>taking a closer look at Basit Igtet.</p>
<p>Igtet’s late father was a radical leader of Islamic extremists – although Basit denies this. But his father’s extremist activities soon caught the attention of Libya’s then leader, Muammar Gaddafi, and his Jamahiriyah government – which always took a zero-tolerance stance to any kind of internal terrorism. Particularly when those trying to subvert the Libyan state were doing so on behalf of foreign and Zionist agendas. Igtet Sr embezzled millions of dollars from the Gaddafi government and was sent to prison for doing so.</p>
<p>Basit Igtet ran off to Switzerland. He lived in exile for over 20 years – but he chose Switzerland for a very specific reason. For it was here that Igtet found his fathers’ embezzled millions. This is how Basit Igtet built his company and became a multi-millionaire by the age of 45 – although he would have you believe a quite different story.</p>
<p>Whilst in Switzerland, he joined with the wealthy Zionists and become a devout worker for Zionism. He seized his opportunity, when it came, to make the Jewess Sara Bronfman his girlfriend and later his wife. She is a daughter of a man who – until his death – was one of the world’s richest and most powerful Zionists, thanks to an empire based on trading in booze…</p>
<p>Once he has cemented his position as leader of Libya, Igtet intends to announce Libya’s full recognition of the ‘state of israel’ – and to allow ‘israel’ to set up a military base in the Green Mountain region of Libya… He strongly espouses the Western and Zionist agenda of capitalism and free markets.</p>
<p>One of Igtet’s top backers though is John McCain – a man who has been photographed shaking hands with almost every extremist in Libya and who was a major figure in the plot of the invasion and destruction of the country in 2011.</p>
<p>But what the media never mention is that the Hensley gangster fortune that backs McCain is, in fact, a branch of the same bootlegging and racketeering fortune of the Bronfman dynasty of Canada…</p>

<p>A web of Swiss bank accounts were opened. Some suggested this activity – as well as the Bronfman-controlled Bank of Montreal having had their bank account for the Prohibition Era alcohol put under a false name – led to suspicions of money laundering.        
</p>
<p>And is it merely coincidence that Basit Igtet ended up in Switzerland with his father’s ill-gotten gains already there?</p>

            Basit Igtet’s Independent Libya Foundation: An Uncharitable Critique
           </p>
           <p>
            Two founders and their financial ambitions are listed below:
           </p>
           <p>
            In announcing the Belgium office of the Independent Libya Foundation, “Co-founder Richard Reinert,a former chairman of the International Petroleum Exchange and a hedge fund and oil executive…” seems to revealed his real interest, “…The beauty with Libya is that they don’t need money” because the country’s oil wealth, which eventually ‘can be used to benefit the people and the country
           </p>
           <p>
            As mentioned before, the other example is that Richard H. Griffiths, Executive Director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Libya who started as the media contact/vice president of the US-Libya Chamber of Commerce.  Simultaneously, Mr. Griffith was the Independent Libya Foundation’s media contact/ registrant for all the press releases and later was  ”officially appointed as the Director of International Affairs for the Brussels-based Independent Libya Foundation (ILF).”
           </p>
           <p>
            Sara Bronfman, Basit Igtet and their business partner, Richard Griffiths.
           </p>
           <p>
            We feel compelled to provide this article  which has since been cleaned from Authorsden which was boastfully authored by Richard H. Griffiths about himself.   The article’s highlights note Richard H. Griffiths’ impressive connections to American and Canadian intelligence agencies such as CIA, CSIS (Canadian Security and Intelligence Agency), and the US Navy.   As well as being “…exclusive director of public relations for Scaix (Nasdaq-UGMI) a US based counter Terrorism and tactical equipment developer for the US Military, CIA, FBI and Intelligence…”    He further elaborated:  “Mr. Griffiths has developed relationships with United States counter intelligence as well as Special Operations command as well as having classified clearance via NASA.”
           </p>
           <p>
            As we said before, a Chamber of Commerce is a non-governmental entity whose profit orientation is to arrange access to policy makers within the Libyan Government.   It is the business of selling access and influence.

              It just keeps going and going and constantly connecting up to my past and ongoing research lol - hilariously enough, I was looking into Libya(just looking, haven't written about it yet) right before it got really interesting - then Julian Assange came along and totally stole my thunder there lol, no worries though, I have my own stuff to work on xD

              His[Richard Griffiths] name rings a bell thats for sure... where the fuck did I see it... A few things there are familiar even.

              That's bloody long and I'm not quite on the Libya topic yet - probably even better that others do take the lead on that angle, I'll be touching on that one in my own way at some point but that won't be much compared to what others can bring to the table in that department.

                It's amazing how NXIVM is such a strong connecting factor between so much shit going on... right now I'm currently keeping it slightly aside while I get ready for something much bigger which is, incidentally, connected.
