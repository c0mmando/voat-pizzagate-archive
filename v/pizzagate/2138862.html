To maintain status with CASA, you have to attend meetings/continuing education. When I saw an FBI agent was going to speak about Human Trafficking, I jumped at the chance to see what he\'d have to say. </p>
<p>Some of his 2 hr lecture I was happy to hear, some of it, not so much. But keep in mind, this lecture is geared towards CASA volunteers so I\'m sure his angle would be slightly different than if he we talking to cops or what have you. A volunteer will have access to kids that are reported/known versus a kid that has been trafficked, unknown and not attending school or seen in public. </p>
<p>His slide show gave a few graphs from Palantir- red flag. Not sure if Palantir Project is working WITH the FBI or if they just took info from Palantir. He also said trafficked girls are used to traffic other girls. When searching, look for &quot;Bottom Bitch&quot;. This is what this means. Of course, we know they call their pimps &quot;Daddy&quot;.</p>
<p>Also, those with kids, to check and make sure ur kid isn\'t on these weird sites, if you check your kids\' cell phones, look for TWO calculator apps. Apparently, there is apps out there where you can HIDE other sites/apps under a calculator icon. You won\'t know that it\'s actually a fake icon until you click it. </p>
<p>As we know, he said the internet is the new Trafficking. The biggest sites:</p>
<p>Craig\'s List</p>
<p>Backpage.com</p>
<p>Sipsap.com</p>
<p>Grainbelts news</p>
<p>USASexGuideForum- discuss different prostitues, but he said some will stop each other talking about kids</p>
<p>SexyEscorts</p>
<p>Backpage- he said there have been busts on this site. But its been difficult and they use Bitcoin. When they shut sites down, they turn around and just start new ones. The newest off branch of Backpage is EroticMonkey. </p>
<p>Of course, Facebook, Twitter, Tinder, Instagram, Snapchat, and a newer one MeetMe</p>
<p>Other sites:
Myex.com
Revengeporn.com
Shesashomewrecker.com (think this is the one that also has a page on FB)
Jezebel.com</p>
<p>Of course he mentioned darknet, darkweb, deepweb</p>
<p>As far as holding the Internet responsible to remove content, well I jus heard GoOg is fighting AGAINST regulations of Humantrafficking???</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/14/16308066/sex-trafficking-bill-sesta-google-cda-230">https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/14/16308066/sex-trafficking-bill-sesta-google-cda-230</a></p>
<p>I asked why he didn\'t include YouTube since it\'s OBVIOUS what\'s going on there. He didn\'t have much of an answer which pissed me off</p>
<p>He also mentioned how trafficked people from other countries with language barriers are hard to help. Main reason being, they are threatened if they talk that their families will be killed back in their home countries. He said Queens,NY is HUGE with Chinese trafficked women. They are able to get to Johns by having prepaid taxi tickets given to them with addresses on them that they give to cab drivers so they don\'t have to communicate. I wonder how many taxi cab companies are aware and part of this trafficking network?</p>
<p>Much of the lecture was geared towards girls that get lured into this by exposing themselves on social media or run aways (again, this leans towards CASA) But it was disturbing to hear they try to do education seminars at schools about the danagers of social media and the schools say NO, they either don\'t believe in the human trafficking epidemic or they don\'t want the kids exposed to negative info/sexual content?!? WTF? If anyone here has kids, I\'d DEMAND the FBI come to the school for lectures. </p>
<p>They also mentioned that they can\'t get stricter laws passed for the perps because &quot;the 50-70 year old men (senators/congress/state legislators) feel that if they keep it as a misdemeanors vs a felony, then men won\'t lose their jobs and have a stigma for a &quot;mistake&quot; they made. Of course, protect the pedo scums vs the victims. DAMN is our world fucked up. </p>
<p>So bottom line, there needs to be more of a banded unit...parents, the public together raising their voices to get legislation passed to help the kids. He said predictions are that human trafficking will surpass the #1 spot of most profitable illegal crime (drugs) in 2018, yet people are blind to it, news never talks about it and there isn\'t a large enough effort to give it Awareness.</p>',

            Thank you for sharing this very useful information.

           <p>
            Did the stuff about the 50-70-year-old lawmakers and their line of thinking come from the Palantir material, or was it volunteered by the agent?

             It was actually another speaker who works with the trafficked kids after they have been rescued.  I don't remember the organization she works for but she was extremely angry when talking about it.

            He didn't talk about Planitir by name, it was in the slides. I also don't fully trust FBI, but more so than CIA. The people I personally worked with in CASA were legit, 100% stand up people. CPS system is however, screwed up to the max.

            Not sure what you mean by "we don't need a lecture on how to find". Who doesn't need a lecture and to find what?

             The FBI &amp; CIA are the same entity through JTTF.....FBI are CIA operatives in high ranks. CASA is run from the top...you will never get a case involving government. They won't allow it....That is the reason for CASA to control the narrative. The citizens are great people but they do not realize this.

              Again, what did you mean by we don't need a lecture to find? And of course CASA isn't going to get a case involving government. That's kinda a given don't you think?
             </p>
             <p>
              But at least some volunteer citizens have helped some abused kids. I had my share of cases. Shit that haunted me for a long time. I guess trying is better than not.

               I deleted that I said it in a way I did not mean sorry a lot is going on. This is a great post and citizens are amazing that is why we are here.

               The FBI special agents and everyday agent are selfless, tireless, heros as are most officers.
              </p>
              <p>
               Just emphasizing the top brass. Once Comey was seen after getting fired as a top CASA representative...it is conserving. I hoped he was a hero that would intervene and take a stand. He knows all about this. Maybe he was also compromised?
              </p>
              <p>
               The true hero agents are helping now like FBIANON...:)

                I totally agree with you, all the top brass are corrupt AF and I'm sure several in lower ranks. But just like we've seen, some are trying I hope. But they usually get suicided. I do think if the FBI were at least allowed into schools to warn kids the dangers of the internet and being lured into trafficking/prostitution, it would help. But schools not allowing it? BIG RED FLAG.

            This is an excellent post with great leads.  Thank you for using your time and funds to go to the FBI agent's human trafficking lecture, coming away with such good notes, and letting the other attendees know about YouTube's child trafficking through your question for the presenter.  Awesome work!

              it can be happening without the cab companies in the know. I worked as a taxi dispatcher. There are company 'calls' and private calls. Cabbies would go in and out of company service to attend to their private calls. Some cabbies have a full clientele and only pay the cab company gas and gate to use the cab, they don't take a single call from company dispatch.

              and, in an odd convergence of seemingly unrelated threads, we can connect taxis to the "Supreme Master" Ching Hai.  a LARGE percentage of cabs in Taiwan sport Supreme Master bumper stickers, which is a peculiarity  I noticed many years ago (long before I even knew anything about the organization.)  i always got a strange, cult-ish vibe from their infomercials and billboards.

                 Go figure. All the more reason we need to all gather to a different thread like PizzagateWhatever or the uncensored one. And explains why I couldn't find it anymore. Obviously, something in this thread has significant info that needs more digging. I searched the Panama Papers long ago, WJC or companies with "Chelsea" have quite a bit of ties to Taiwan   Could also explain HRC with her weird ass kimono outfits she always wore.
