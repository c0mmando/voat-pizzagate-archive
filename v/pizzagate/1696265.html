Pizzagate is part of a wide crime scene of human trafficking, and seems like the first conspiracy theory proving the value and importance of citizen journalism. I\'m working my ways to get my two cents shared, since as a citizen, I feel responsible for our kids disappearing all over the globe. Looking into the topic is awful but a necessity. The matter is serius, and it seems to be left for the community to start clearing everything out.</p>
<p>I\'ve been thinking about the citizen journalism itself, tinkering ways to work together. My problem is that parties involved are sneaking into each others work, and not everybody sees through this. Some of us might even help the criminals without knowing that! The parties involved are:</p>
<p><strong>DIRECTLY INVOLVED</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The actual criminals, in several areas of life, who are possibly (1) Buying or blackmailing governments, transportation offices, customs, press, lawyers, judges, police... and (2) sharing unreliable information to all the other parties, including fake-intelligence-data, fake-news, not-important-actual-data(!) acting as whistelblowers to improve their crediability. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1694556">Good list</a></li>
<li>The people hired/blackmailed by the actual criminals doing exactly the same as above, but being more difficult to connect to directly into the case. They are able to feed other parties a lot of shit</li>
<li>The honest whistelblowers sharing relevant data (which is difficult to confirm by other parties because of their pretenders, but still possible)</li>
<li>The dishonest whistelblowers, sharing both real and false data in purpose to just to mix the soup, making honest parties seemingly unreliable. A tactic used in the intelligece community for a long time with succesful outcome. Very dangerous group who might never face any charges.</li>
<li>The skilled tinkers and logically minded investigators pulling the data together, but not necessarily sharing (or being able to share) too much of their findings. This group includes the honest work done by governmental officers. Important work to be supported.</li>
<li>The honest parties in police, justice, customs CATCHING and JAILING the criminals. I have more on this to share later, but in overall, this party seems to be pretty much silenced and their work made impossible by their superiors. The source of new whistleblowers.</li>
<li>The victims. Oh, those poor children, I hate to mention them knowing who one might feel. Most of them silenced in multiply ways, they don\'t get their word out. Should be both encouraged and helped. </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: The criminal party is efficienlty taking advance of ALL the other parties in several ways. A horrible example would be pretending as a helper, taking information directly from the victims but using that information to cause the problem to exapand.  Or for example <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170305033046/https://www.facefirst.com/solutions/watchlist-as-a-service/solutions-watchlist-missing/">spreading a mobile app with face recognition for finding missing children</a>, without telling that the same app might be used (or even worse, is even meant to be used) by the criminals. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>INDIRECTLY INVOLVED PUBLIC PARTIES (LIKE THIS FORUM)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The skilled HONEST journalists with investigative attitude, categorazing the information (true/falce with more success than mistakes), connecting parties involved (with more success than mistakes). Btw I see many ppl with similar thought in mind here, which is great!!!</li>
<li>The unskilled HONEST bloggers/journalist students, trying to do the above but make more mistakes.</li>
<li>The skilled DISHONEST journalists, a very DANGEROUS group motivated by POLITICAL/IDEOLOGICAL point of view. Easily mixed with the group hired/blackmailed by the criminals, and very difficult to separate from them. Possibility to feed a lot of shit without consequences, not actually being criminals. Be sure, there are these people here as well.</li>
<li>The unskilled DISHONEST bloggers, motivated by gains or personal reasons. Easier to recognize, these are the clickbait writers sharing both SHIT and VALUABLE stuff with the same interest. They are skilled in making NOISE, making them an efficient party to affect the public opinion. We should get in touch with them, as they might be unaware of the trouble they cause for getting everything cleared out (while sharing fake-data without questioning that). Well, some of them wouldn\'t listen anyway...</li>
<li>Individuals forwarding information, a very important group for us. These are the people who like and share what other parties do, waking up the masses, in both good and bad. Before the common knowledge (critical mass) is reached, we don\'t need to worry about if they share shit or great work as long as they have the courage to keep on sharing. After the critical mass is reached, we should find the ways to reduce the spreading of shit. In the meanwhile, we should trust the public to make their own opinion on what\'s shit and what\'s worth sharing.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: We should keep in mind that ANYTHING PUBLISHED can be will be used by all the parties, including CRIMINALS taking advantage of YOUR WORK. We are easily helping them to locate their weak spots and making the work of the honest, direct investigation both easier and more difficult. <strong>This should be knowledged among us, but it should not silence us!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>INDIRECTLY INVOLVED UNPUBLIC PARTIES</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Groups doing the work as above, but in secrecy, trying to avoid the criminal parties to get mixed into their group. Unfortunately, I see this as impossible. They\'ll sneak in somehow at some point, and all their work might end up being more helpful to the criminal side. </li>
<li>Personal investigations delivered to ANY OTHER PARTIES, based on who one trusts or on ones motivations.</li>
<li>People who KNOW about the criminals or their ways of working, but keep their mouth shut. As sad group, possibly udef fear. We should figure out ways to help them, as carrying such a burden (considering honest people) is a heavy load. </li>
<li>Concerned public, either too afraid or too confused to join any of the other parties, still looking into this. A HUGE GROUP OF PEOPLE, most of them wanting to help but not knowing how to do it in the right way. Part of them could be mobilized, taking a note in that they might belong to ANY PUBLIC PARTY. <strong>Note: I was personally in this group for quite a while. Thanks to you, not any more.</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: On any great work done unpublic, understanding that keeping low profile is motivated by either fear towards the criminal parties, or by a false idea that the criminals could not get access to it when evetually used in public, or by uncertaintly on the topic, there are a lot of concerning issues related to these groups. In my opinion, thes groups should keep low profile for now, and follow closely if the data by more public parties is being used properly. If it happens that the criminal parties manage to misguide the public groups, these hidden groups are about the only hope we have. Hoping that their data finds honest viewers at some point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THE SILENT MASS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Those who already know, but don\'t act. To be encouraged.</li>
<li>Those who suspect, but haven\'t made up their mind on any actions. Let\'s guide them to the accurate data, before the criminal parties or their slaves guide them elsewhere. We need these people.</li>
<li>Those who don\'t care. Sad that there are people in this group. Very sad.</li>
<li>Those who don\'t know. Let\'s just spread the word!</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for reading this far. Did you find yourself? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>WE ARE ALL CONCERNED OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING, the <strong>3rd most profitable crime in the world</strong>, milllions of kids disappearing every year. It would be IMPOSSIBLE that this wasn\'t covered up by high level parties. Children in slavery, in psychiatric studies to take control of minds of the masses or to develop AI, in totally screwed sex, in sick art... Oh, why don\'t we take care of other people\'s children any more as a community. Sad. Some light for this tunnel: It doesn\'t take millions of men to save millions of kids. Our work is important, never forget that, while the main stream media is unable to do this. Don\'t ever think that someone excepts you to follow all the journalistic standards while sharing names or pics. You have an excuse, accepted by the public, because of the situation in the main stream media. Don\'t take justice into your hands. Don\'t blaim, don\'t accuse, but show the connections in the most honest way you can. Be brave, be honest, stay in the light whatever you find. We can do this.</p>

               Good, I took a Fed job test once and there's an entire hour of correcting punctuation grammar etc bcuz half your work will be drafting memos to be quickly read by your coworkers. Thus I am immediately suspicious of someone who hasn't ingrained those habits into their writing.

If it's found out that this crime is covered up in such high levels as suggested here, I'm sure no whistleblower is convicted. Heroes of the community worth medals in this case. If one blow to the whistle saves one child's life, its already more than welcome. When the court finds out that a child would have been dead without it, what do you really think?

               I can only hope that any laws preventing such serious crimes to be revealed would be changed. The court is, eventually, what we make of it. There's really no case where a whistle has been seen as necessary earlier?

                Have you been in court, where the judge has an army of lawyers (even your own) lined up against you to take your personal and business property (or children) even though you are a victim of a physical violence crimes and that person owes you restitution, has threatened your life and is in prison? because this is happens in courts in the united states even though there are all sorts of laws that the judge and those lawyers are breaking. Did you know that a litigant can be locked up indefinitely in some states for contempt of court (which is whatever the judge wants it to be?

                 Can anything be done to that? I'm more towards realizing the facts and towards solutions than accepting something like that (so thanks for bringing the issue up, as it's pretty relevant also in the human trafficking cases). If the crimes takes place in war/coflict zones (where children are hijacked), could an international war court be used?

                  do you think that victimized children can afford uncorrupted international lawyers when even citizens of the united states can't get justice?

                   Problematic, yes. Defence attorney is free, but if uncorrupted... hmm. Well, we're not actually in this stage quite yet with the pizzagate (hopefully soon), so should we focus on actions helping the current stage instead?

                     Sorry I was confused... Victims would be heard, hopefully, and the prosecutor would be either hired or public. But should we really get out of court? Maybe not constructive at this point, while the first charges are yet to come
