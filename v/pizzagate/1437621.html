            Hey man,
           </p>
           <p>
            Its a crazy time yeah? Ive spent about a year "out of the matrix" and dwelving into all this shit they dont teach us in school, I didn't think that this is what I would find man. It's fucked up to say the least and its fucking with a lot of people, including myself. I think it's definitely necessary for us to debrief as this is really intense stuff. Feel free to send me a message if you want to chat more? It's hard man. But we are waking up! This is getting huge, as it should be, with 0 thanks to the mainstream media. Much love man.

            I'm pretty sure there will be no prosecution, as there is no hard evidence for the assertions that a pizza parlor facilitiates illicit child activities.   What is the legal burden of proof, and what charges would be brought?
