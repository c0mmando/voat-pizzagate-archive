           <p>
            Thank you for pulling together all those links and including mine in the list. Also for this post. I am new here and don't plan to visit often, but wanted to share raw material for the collection.
           </p>
           <p>
            As to the personal/character attacks, well this is a public forum and people are anonymous so I guess it is to be expected. Yes, I am Jewish, overweight, ugly (large Jewish nose is unmistakable), hold a Ph.D. in sociology/women's studies, and am self-promotional.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said: To publicly come out and support the worldwide investigation effort into pizzagate/pedogate is to brand yourself as a crackpot. Even if you ignore what happened to the public figures who have done so, just read the comments on the
            <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2017/03/25/protesters-outside-white-house-demand-pizzagate-investigation/">
             Washington Post article
            </a>
            about the rally. The level of hate and condescension was unbelievable.
           </p>
           <p>
            As to quoting disinformation agents, hopefully that is not the case, but then again I am not an expert. So far the way I decide on what's real, and not real, is to read a lot and then compare similarities across accounts. When so many people talk about:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             The CIA, or elements of the CIA
            </li>
            <li>
             Stonewalling by law enforcement (the FOIA request on Comet, lack of investigation, claims that kids should "stay home," that it's a runaway problem, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
             Child Protective Services
            </li>
            <li>
             Murder, people being beaten up, frozen accounts, attacks on social media for speaking out
            </li>
            <li>
             Media coverup and censorship (I keep hearing "debunked" but nothing was ever "debunked")
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            ...and on and on and on, something is there.
           </p>
           <p>
            I specifically wanted to write a blog about going to the event because I had a feeling that the media would represent it inaccurately. It also seemed to me that people would be afraid to attend for security reasons (this is something that came up on Twitter), and I wanted to support it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Indeed, just before the event, Alex Jones issued his "
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaAqvRYH1dM">
             apology
            </a>
            ," and then a day afterward there was the 60 Minutes piece on Mike Cernovich, trying to paint a picture of him as a promoter of "fake news". Coverage from
            <a href="http://www.dcclothesline.com/2017/03/27/et-tu-gateway-pundit-report-on-saturdays-pizzagate-march-on-d-c-disappeared-into-the-memory-hole/">
             The Gateway Pundit was scrubbed
            </a>
            from the web.
           </p>
           <p>
            For the record, I was afraid to go to the rally myself, which is indicative of the level of fear people feel. It is unfortunate that the children who are being trafficked in this country (and around the world) live in that kind of fear every single minute.

            Another highlight:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In fact, the term "pizza" refers to two things.
            </p>
            <p>
             Number one, leaked emails that have never been contested with respect to their validity. Those emails contained references to pizza that do not appear to have anything to do with pizza. 
   Number two, graphic sexualized images of pizza and children that appeared on the public social media accounts of a pizza shop proprietor. (I leave it to the reader to Google these images.)
            </p>
            <p>
             It is noteworthy that the Department of Homeland Security released a video for human trafficking month (January 2017) showing a minor being trafficked outside a pizza parlor. The symbolism was hard to ignore.

            Wonderful.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me highlight:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I did not get the impression that people attending were "crazy." Rather, they seemed sincerely concerned about kids. If anything, observing conversations, it was clear that they were self-educated, and trying to get some official information. This is a sentiment I wholeheartedly share: Let's get the facts.
            </p>
            <p>
             Getting an official investigation going, without citizen investigators having to do the work, was the entire purpose of the protest.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is not acceptable to tell young Black girls to "stay home" to avoid getting kidnapped and trafficked.
