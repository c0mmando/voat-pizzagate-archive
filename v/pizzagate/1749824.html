            LOS ANGELES –  Broadband and telecommunications giant Verizon is under fire for defending its decision to provide hard-core porn titles with child and incest themes. The company was included in the 2014 Dirty Dozen List of pornography’s leading facilitators, compiled by Morality in Media (MIM), a national organization that opposes pornography.

           <p>
            Haven't even read all of your post as yet, but just want to say astounding that the all the pornography infiltrating not only the internet, but creeping into so much programming on cable TV was just passed over in the search.
Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

           <p>
            And, I just happened to have read this at the Johnny Gosch website -- a comment by his mother, Noreen . . .
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Noreen Gosch and the Discovery:  Years ago one of our regular PreventingAbuseConference speakers,  Noreen Gosch, mother of kidnapping victim Johnny Gosch discovered her son was abducted by a national pedophile ring (30 years ago). A few years back she uncovered a massive Internet pornography network resulting in hundreds of arrests.    Below is a statement from her:  &gt;

             "Human trafficking is fanned by the flames of "pornography".  The internet has made it easy for these perverted individuals to view [pornography] .... all types and soon that isn't enough to achieve their thrills, they must move on to something else which is often violating a child.   Addiction to [pornography] is the breeding ground for "human trafficking, murder and torture of young innocent victims."

            Look for photograph of "News Headlines"
           </p>
           <p>
            Obviously, pornography is also a great concern for every female who is demeaned and degraded by it and put in danger by it as it encourages a callousness towards females, if not outright violence against women.
           </p>
           <p>
            It serves a propaganda against females which can be very effective in doing damage to the group targeted, as we've seen throughout history -- whether Jews, or homosexuals, or women.  And, of course, any time that women/Mothers are de-powered then children are put in great danger.  The oppression of women all over the world is one of the reasons why pedophilia and child molestation thrives.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just a reminder:  Males are our sexual abusers of children and they are heterosexual males.
Homosexual males are 100X less likely to sexually abuse a child than a heterosexual male.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here more info from a study -- 
A 1998 Study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.
           </p>
           <p>
            Research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are less likely than heterosexual to sexually abuse children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps the most egregious and damaging claim promulgated by anti-gay groups is the claim that homosexuality is intrinsically linked to pedophilia and child sexual abuse.  The social science research on sexual orientation and child sexual abuse clearly disproves the claim that homosexuals are more likely to molest children.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.  One researcher explained this statistic by noting, "Gay men desire consensual sexual relations with other adult men.  Pedophiles are usually adult men who are sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children.  They are rarely sexually attracted to other adults.  In fact, research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are LESS likely than heterosexuals to sexually abuse children.  Two studies that examined the sexual orientation of convicted child molesters found that less than 1% in one study and 0% in the other were lesbian or gay.  One psychologist reviewed the existing social science literature on the relationship between sexuality and child sexual abuse and found that "a gay man is no more likely  than a straight man to perpetrate sexual activity with children."  Further, "cases of perpetration of sexual behavior with a pre-pubescent child by an adult lesbian are virtually nonexistent."
            </p>
            <p>
             Gay rights activists, like all advocates for children's welfare, oppose child sexual abuse and support equitable age of consent laws that help prevent and punish such abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             At least 110,000 children are waiting to be adopted in the US.  Approximately 588,00 children are currently in foster care.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
            </p>
            <p>
             Children who remain in foster care for much of their childhood, as do tens of thousands of American children, are more likely to have emotional problems.  Some children in foster care live in 20 or more homes by the time they reach the age of 18.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting is not simply unjust and unethical; it also decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
            </p>
            <p>
             Research shows that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are not disadvantaged vis-a-vis their peers raised by heterosexual parents.&gt;

            **Footnote 65 -- p.123 **
*A review of 352 medical records of children evaluated for sexual abuse during a 12-month period at a Denver children's hospital found that less than 1% had been abused by a gay man or a lesbian.  Of 269 adult perpetrators of child abuse identified among the 352 cases of abuse, only two were  gay or lesbian.  The vast majority of the children in the study (82%) "were suspected of being abused by a man or a woman who was, or had been, in a heterosexual relationship with a relative of the child."  And the review concluded that in this sample, " a child's risk of being molested by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is over 100X greater [than the risk of being molested] by someone who might be identifiable as being homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual."

            In an earlier study of convicted male child molesters in Massachusetts, none of the 175 men were found to have an exclusively homosexual adult sexual orientation or to be primarily attracted to other adult men.

            Porn might be used as a cover to harm kids, but child porn itself reduces pedophilia, or did in one European country that legalized it. It's just like with the rest of us. If we have porn to watch for masturbation, we don't need prostitutes or rape as much.

            Since we're just speculating I'm going to guess that the porn industry is under too much scrutiny to cross any lines.

            In the case of porn companies the risks of doing anything illegal would outweigh the rewards.

             And we hear over and again that those watching the pornography sites say that more and more porn featuring children is being introduced into regular sites.  Sometimes they begin by using "of age" but young looking males/females.  But gradually they move on to actual youngsters.  It continues to get pushed into regular porn.

            Hey, long time no chatter, I've been gone for about a month and have had to bury a parent over these past few weeks so I'm now getting back to research on this. Interesting that you mention this because I actually have a friend who is in the pornography industry and she stated herself that pizzagate is partially a part of the porn industry. I know that with my friend that while she had a really good life, decent parents, and she got into the industry on her own because it paid a heck of a lot more than being a chemical engineer, which is what her degree is in, that that is not the case with a vast majority of these girls and young women.

             If you are aware of the violence and constant abuse to the bodies of women in pornography, you know that they are barely able to spend 3 months in what is happening now in porn.
It's not "Love Actually" -- it's highly abusive to female bodies.
And again most of these females have history of early sexual abuse.
And I doubt you'd find even one male who has a chemical engineering degree in the porn industry.
Why would that be true for any female?

            Hi there. I am from Germany. A friend of mine came over from the united States when she was 18 years old (way back). She was searching for a job and filled out a form for a film production. Because she didn't speak our language at this time she checked the box for "Erwachsenenfilme" (adult movies) along with commercial productions and other stuff. This mistake got her in real trouble. Soon she was ordered to a casting. She did the casting and she and other girls were then told that they would go to Russia the next day to have a photo shooting. She was so naive and went with them. She said that not every girl was an adult. From there they were brought everywhere. She said, that she sometimes sat more on a plane than in any country and that they all had a hard time understanding each other because all the girls came from other countries. She fled the scene one night while they stayed in London. She got away. But she kept the shock for life that one simple checked box in a fill out form had nearly destroyed her whole life. Isn't that interesting that thoose legal productions just ship you around the world where you might get lost …

            It is a fact that 95% porn actresses were molested as minors. If you ask any porn star she will nod her head. Porn industry is a funny industry, it caters to different tastes - and that is where problem begins. Also porn develops into addiction, and every addict seeks a new high - and hence he seeks more and more depraved stuff which leads staight to Abyss. Porn is a very murky, misunderstood industry with a really dark side. Sadly, porn is here to stay for good.

                  I used to drive Taxi during college years, had regular customers - strippers. They opened up and told me all about it. Then I interviewed a few porn stars - real life. I suggest you do the same thing.

                   Your assumption that I do not know or have not lived a similar life myself reveals the problem here. I believe your intentions are good. And I don't doubt for a second that there are plenty of people working in the sex industry that have a history of violence, abuse and molestation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   But to be a valuable part of the discussion here, unless your intention is to distract, one must be willing to self-edit and recognize the difference between an opinion and a fact. Claiming "95%+" of sex workers/porn stars are victims of abuse without any documentation, source or data is no different than me claiming 95% of people who comment on Voat are morons. True, some are. Many are, in fact. But 95% ... ?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   All I'm saying is be aware and be willing to defend when you call something a "fact." That is the only way to make progress with investigations. I appreciate you giving more color to your statement and experiences. That sort of information would be valuable to include when you make a claim in the future. ;)

                    Basically go to any Porn Producer (as I have done) and he will tell you - behind the scenes. Candid talk. Some factoids are not recorded, hence no official sensus! It's the same with Homosexuality &amp; pedophilia correlation; we know it's high but we have no official statistics, the best we can do is garner from an insider - and Milo Yannopolis did just that. He lifted the veil and told us inner secret about homosexuals, in that pederasty comprises huge part of gay culture. As with porn, you may wonder how I can make these claims. I grew up with porn. Porn (straight vanilla kind) played a huge part in during my puberty and I developed facination. I did for many years even when I was in relationships. I went as far to date one, and a stripper. I got a glimpse of that elusive world. You won't find it on pages galup polls. You see, this is a statistic that would not be disclosed to an outsider. Only in a discreet setting, to a trusted confidant - I was a cab driver with regular customers who were strippers, which many use as a stepping stone to porn. I can fill several volumes of what I discovered. And yes - porn plays huge part in child porn specifically. There is a big market for this, even among those who don't consider themselves as pedophiles, but who want to watch it out of sheer morbid curiosity, kind of like watching Hostel Franchise not because you are a sadistic freak but to get an adrinalin rush. Personally, idea of child porn is a no go are, it is beyond depraved even the thought - thought police does come in handy (sorry Orwell), but that's me.  That is the problem with humans, intelect breeds perversity. Very comicated and disturbing. No black &amp; white, gray areas in between.

            Yes, you're spot on in the observation. Here's another one: they create markets for themselves. How? Well, suppose they're now including free images of kiddie porn to get people hooked.

            You could do your investigations by sticking to doing business searches. Compile lists of companies producing this crap and then do other searches to see maybe shell companies and the names connected with the businesses/shell companies. In other words, FOLLOW THE MONEY.

            I turn to the source and wonder if it isn't the violence at birth especially as it relates to circumcision. I wish that practice was eliminated for men and women worldwide. There needs to be at least medically peer review long term studies on it. You know the scholarly sanitization of dirty topics.

            I think the ones making real money for child porn is in the dark web. But I want to warn anyone that doesn't already know this, you should NOT go try to find these sites! They could turn that against you so fast your head will spin. Don't do anything that could make them accuse you of child porn. I think that is something we cannot touch. It's one thing to investigate. But, nothing illegal. Do what you want, but be smart. Besides, you can never unsee those images.

             There has been a closing lately associated with a large ex-military structure in San Francisco that was for BDSM and such that lamented the lack of revenue because of the ready availability.

            That would be Kink.com
           </p>
           <p>
            I think they failed because the building is large, so I assume the rent or at least hydro would be high. I think they had events there, but some "not in my backyard" types complained.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, the content they provide is niche. Most people - such as myself - who are into that content access it for free elsewhere, whether it be "illegally" posted Kink.com videos like Extreme Bondage or bondage videos produced by others for free.
           </p>
           <p>
            I always thought it was kind of weird and funny that they always have the actors say stuff like "it was fun!" at the end. Like if they were being forced to fuck, they would also be forced to say they consented to it. I do think they were willing participants though, and it was just a way to cover their ass from prudes and prejudiced people.

            We should also say the same thing about violence ( not that I am knocking your comment because I am not ) . Its been normalized thanks to our media and games that we all play and watch daily . Notice how people get more upset over pictures of animals that are dead then they do over an actual dead child ?  They just do not show dead animals on T.V. but dead people we see every day . It makes one wonder if this has not all been done by design and where we have left to go from here.

             I 100% agree. I cannot stand violent movies/media and my husband thinks I'm strange. I go so long without that type of indoctrination that I'm shocked and disturbed when I do see moves now. I hate to be seen as a "goody two shoes" to my friends, but I genuinely don't like watching the sex and gore in entertainment anymore.

            Pornography is promoted in societies to degenerate a culture or nation of people. Cultural Marxism at its finest. Karl Marx himself looked at the family as property. There are reasons why this is pushed in our society. The same group of people started Pornography, Hollywood, and pre-Hollywood. It's the same group that owns the media. I have no doubt that all of these organizations, including CPS, are all connected on some level and ultimately make up a world that is foreign to us yet everyday life to them. Hard part is connecting all of the dots and convincing your fellow man/woman.

            I disagree with the kink.com San Francisco Armory being involved in any way with pedophilia.  I lived in SF for over a decade and have many friends that work for the company.  It is a very professional studio space with lovely employees.  Do not demonize consensual S&amp;M and fetish experimentation.  Human sexuality is ultimately a positive thing if you aren't hurting anyone.  Especially children.  Once we cross that line then start to call it out.

             I was saying that kink.com doesn't make enough money to cover their costs. How are these companies covering expenses when their product is free to anyone who wishes to use it? Kink going under may prove your point about being technically legal, but what of the others?

             As soon as you remove sexuality from God's perfect plan of marriage, it will naturally become more and more perverted. What you're talking about is a gateway to crossing the line even further. In time, you will not get a rise out of the "kink" and then go looking for more...cue downward spiral.

            I for one will not do any clicking on or looking up anything to do with this sick shit😵
I do agree though someone should look into this industry more.
Be careful, this is a slippery slope. I know trained law enforcement officers who was assigned to monitor possible CP chatrooms and sites. One who was investigating for only 9 months, has had to go on disability for PTSD. She refuses to use electronics, no phone, no TV nothing. She will not go to places that kids are at. She does not attended family gatherings when kids will be there. No pics of family's kids, nothing. She said that when she sees kids, she automatically wants to question them. To make sure no one has touched them. She said the things she saw and heard will haunt her for the rest of her life.

            You're right, porn though is like any other "gateway drug" out there. Categories of legal porn exist, like "teen" that might get some people to go down the rabbit hole and into more sinister stuff like CP.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then again, human trafficking would be happening regardless, whether or not porn even existed. The trafficking business is ancient.

              Believe it or not, CP that's put online, is usually put there by a sick relative or somebody the family knows.. Underage girls getting into drugs and what not, poor circumstances and environment plays a role to.  I'm not advocating for the porn industry, but show the stats.

             Not really. Kinks always existed, and it's just easier for people with like-minded kinks to join together and partake in their fetish. Ain't nothing wrong with it. In all honesty what is wrong is how pornography is ok and legal but prostitution isn't. That doesn't stop people from selling their bodies for sex but think about how much safer the world could be if some people could just get their rocks off paying legal 18+ willing participants into sex.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sounds taboo right, but in all honesty, why is it wrong? Do animals not fuck when they feel the need and yet our society is suppose to act as if we are better than that even though we fail pretty much everywhere else in terms of what's socially acceptable lol.

              Dolphins fuck for fun, like humans. Chimpanzees fuck for social order. Humans fuck for many reasons beyond reproduction; fun, endorphin rushes, pair bonding, "urges." All other animals fuck for reproductive cycles.

             <p>
              Humans have been painting nekkid bodies on cave walls for thousands of years. It's my opinion that what's between consenting adults is fine; unfortunately that opens the door for someone with an agenda to push another into making porn against their will. This is often the case with children. The Dr Phil sex slave episode covered that to a small extent.

              Been saying their pizza charade has been going on for decades. I realized it after seeing that the Chuck E. Cheese CEO (chuck e cheese is basically pedophile heaven) was also behind the creation of our beloved first video game system atari along with the famous hit game PONG, that this shit's been going on for decades. I threw out my pizza rolls after all this stuff because I knew it contained humans, we've all eaten countless humans sorry to say, they need ways to get rid of all these dead bodies, we just eat the shitty drugged up retarded american humans while they go for more scrumptious virgin/non-gmo infected minorities. I'm not crazy but this is where pizzagate is heading, we're all cannibals and pizza child rape has been going on for decades. SAW and HOSTEL we're documentaries and they're doing that under Comet Ping Pong for massive profits from rich sadists, that's why the censorship has been insane, this goes BEYOND CHILD RAPE, people are being tortured mercilessly underground by disgusting freaks who get off to it. WE THE PIZZA was real and that torture menu they found was fucking real, $250,000 to kill rape and torture someone just another day in the fucking bag for a rich Saudi Oil magnate. Wake the fuck up and realize what's going on, pizzagate will forever change our world, we're just queued up in line to be tortured in Deep Web "red rooms" once the final plan is actualized. Don't call me crazy, or do if you want, once you're tied up to the torture rack for the next few years of your life it'll be too motherfucking late.

               Pizza was invented by these people. It was introduced into the United States/Canada in the 1950's. It's a completely created market. I don't think that you're crazy at all. I don't disagree with a single thing that you've said.

               This dude examines the symbolism that they invented EXTREMELY thoroughly:

                I also realized we're brainwashed to love pizza, it's the one food I remember from when I was young that everyone liked. I remember even from kindergarten we we're pretty much taught you're weird if you don't like pizza, not sure how it was for everyone else. Then in middle school we could eat awful poverty "cafeteria" food or do what everyone else did and get the upcharged dominos pizza every single time I went to lunch. We get constant pizza references from tv, pizza commercials/ads every 5 minutes too, it's all part of the coverup. Thanks for those videos I'll check them out, been trying to make more sense of all of this, not sure where the rabbit hole ends this shit's so deep.

                 Pizza was the "only" good food. That was at literally every fucking school. I don't think this rabbit hole ends. I finally understand why it is "Pizza". It's a symbolic reference to Osiris and Horus from Egyptian mythology, as outlined here:

                  Man the head of my elementary school cafeteria was this Indian (feather not dot) lady that my dad was actually related to and she would make this soup called 3 sisters that was so delicious as well as chicken soft tacos in like, Tennessee in the late 80s early 90s, 
She made food that no one else in the entire state would make and the kids all did so much better in grades despite us being in one of the poorest counties in the state. Didn't really mean anything though cause once most of my classmates got out of school they either started working the factories or becoming meth dealers. She did make a really bomb French bread pizza though.

             It's a tough nut to crack. But I'm convinced deep down everyone knows it can seriously fuck you up. I always thought to myself that there was no way porn hadn't negatively effected human sexuality in some way since it became readily available in every household via the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then one day a guy on a forum I was on relayed his story about how he chronically masturbated to porn and had done so since his pre-teen years. When he finally had a chance to be with a girl he couldn't maintain an erection. This was a young guy in college mind you. Later when he went home and sat at the computer, he got an instant erection. He was literally terrified and asking for help. What followed was a flood of responses about very similar experiences, including the need to watch more and more sick shit to even get an erection. It was worse than I had even imagined really.

             The truth is our brains are quite plastic and can be trained into or out of certain behaviors over time with repetition and reinforcement. The long term effects of sexualizing children in the media is without a doubt having some effect. To what extent we simply don't know. But it would be a good tactic to employ if you're in a position of power and are involved with generational pedophilia to get the masses desensitized to it over time. Start getting people used to little girls in booty shorts and eventually there's no one concerned with little girls in booty shorts coming and going from the halls of power.

              Thank you -- 
It's a sign of a healthy individual that they quickly become bored with porn - or depressed by it.

              Imo, it's also about some fake illusion of control over women as it's very easy to imagine control when you have a remote in your hands and the $ to buy porn videos.  Or, when you can $ a magazine and share in the exploitation of females.
And there's now ever more need to sell this fake kind of  "control" to men who can't maintain relationships, have no imagination, and who are overwhelmed by the idea of female equality.

              People have been stupid for a while, letting their young daughters run around swimming areas naked regardless of who's around because the water legitimizes it. People become desensitized, it's been happening for decades. Young girls are by nature modest, and feel ashamed initially, until it becomes more and more 'normalized' in their minds and others, including the parents. In the old Beach Blanket Bingo movies it was incredibly scandalous seeing the girls in tiny two-piece swimsuits. Now you can't view any story on the web w/out seeing much worse. If you wanna swim naked, do it 'non-coed.' Okay downvote me.

                Or in front of strange grown men at the beach or local swimming pool? That's how grossly desensitized we've become. But we know where this kind of delusion comes from. It's the boiling frog in a pot ... we've been so fooled that if you say stuff like this they think you're insane. How many perverts go to the local high school football games to ogle the young cheerleaders? And on and on. But hey, it's all good! Don't be a dirty-minded prude idiot.
