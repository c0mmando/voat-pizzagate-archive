           In November 2011, the FAA ordered that on-line flight tracking websites, such as FlightAware and Flight Tracker, block 7000 tail numbers from being viewed by the general public. Included in the order was Epstein's Gulfstream II.

            At the time I first saw this I didn't factor in the human trafficking ( and organ delivery?) to so many of these planes, but we know renditions still happen and drugs are still run as well. Regardless of cargo there's no doubt these shady flights we see are proving to be dirty every damn time so here's a  10 minute video classic from the not to distant past that just reinforces that this is a ridiculously huge criminal enterprise......

            Hey, no offense intended, but I think it would be really good if you could write these posts in a more condensed, easy-to-follow way, making use of embedded links.  Most users will not have time to read these walls of text. :-)

             I also heard the Epstein showed up at Mira Lago with a couple 'women' and he banned them.  He has also said that Epstein is a weird guy.  These are just some quotes I've read on the internet, so treat it as hearsay.

            Sure, I guess if you're running in those circles... I just want to be cautious that I don't buy into his divinity too much just yet. But you make a good point.

              I guess only time will tell weather he or the people behind him are true catalysts for change. Maybe the only way they had to get this shit out in the open was to use someone who was equally as guilty. Maybe you're only as powerful as those who are blackmailing you? Some blackmailers have morality on their side? Fuck, this is one helluva rabbithole. I just want this planet to be free goddamit!!

               You are not alone. People of good will are going to tear this rats nest out of the walls over the coming months. Mark my words. Don't despair. Just the stubborn refusal of folks to stop talking about this, despite the insane shutdown attempts by Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, PayPal, Wikipedia and Fakebook, not to mention the MSM should tell you that American culture has reached a new phase of development marked by a comeback of critical thinking, personal responsibility and the courageous and unrelenting exercise of liberty. If others are doing what I am doing -- throwing off laziness, doing deep research, adding technical cyber skills for safety, and venturing into areas of social media they've never accessed before -- this country is making a tectonic shift. It is an amazing time to be alive.

            Once again the sources you are copying and pasting from is the only thing that you are not citing, Freed0mFighter. Why is that? You do such a good job with the other links, but it's like you're trying to disguise something by leaving out the source of all the research.

             I feel like there is a yuge story behind the Al Gore sex allegations, but that story died a quick death shortly after it broke and was never heard from again, really. That dude is a creep and sick fuck like the rest, he just hid it better behind his boring facade.

             LOL, I had wondered if Gore was some weird squeaky clean aberration to the Clinton Clan norm, more interested in the smell of his own farts than gettin' some strange.

            <p>
             But that does sound like he was awkward as fuck and really had no game. Just wanted a taste of what Big Willy was enjoying I imagine. Just an all around stiff.

             Is it the same Roy Cohn that raised Donald Trump? Is it the same Epstein that Donald Trump calls a 'Nice Guy'. Aren't we getting more of the same? The public's call of 'lock her up' is going to turn ugly real fast in the age of #pizzagate.

            Motherfucker is above the law. Someone needs to whack him. I'm not suggesting someone attack him, but in my personal opinion, his death would not be mourned, and he should kill himself, if he has any dignity left, which he doesnt. Someone should kill him.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             On November 18, 2012, the President signed into law H.R. 2112, the "Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012”, and was further continued in FY2015. This statue changes the previous entitled Certified Security Concerns Blocking policy in which aircraft owners or operators can limit the dissemination of their aircraft registration in the FAA ASDI data feed. The FAA will still accept and implement all direct requests from private aircraft owners or operators to block their aircraft data from public display in ASDI, including those not accompanied by a Certified Security Concern.

              Just want to point out two things:
1. This rule definitely can be used to hide nefarious stuff.
2. It is also a necessary security measure for many VIPs.
             </p>
             <p>
              Aircraft are vulnerable, and people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos etc. are always on gaurd against hostage taking, stalking, and even threats from foreign entities. Not being able to track the movements of their aircraft is security 101 and doesn't necessarily imply child trafficking.
             </p>
             <p>
              Edit: On the other hand, this is a terrific way to raise awareness. Why did our government allow Epstein to hide his aircraft movements? We need to get this out there because it LOOKS really bad. Fire up the meme generator!
