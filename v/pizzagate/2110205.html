<p>Here is a great write up from Cathy Fox\'s blog... apparently this was released in June of this year. Did I miss a post about it?! <a href="https://cathyfox.wordpress.com/2017/06/17/british-intelligence-bought-information-about-us-child-abusers/">https://cathyfox.wordpress.com/2017/06/17/british-intelligence-bought-information-about-us-child-abusers/</a></p>
<p>An article from 82\' referencing the same investigation: <a href="https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/07/26/Investigators-Monday-reported-a-boy-prostitution-network-operating-in/8645396504000/">https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/07/26/Investigators-Monday-reported-a-boy-prostitution-network-operating-in/8645396504000/</a></p>

            I agree. 1000000%. The Hillary email posts drive me up the wall. Since the search function is effectively gone, sliding is a much more effective shill tactic now.

            Yep..I posted original doc and I do think there is alot there...not only on the testimony from the case...I found it highly interesting that there was speculation that the boys that were abused thru the 70's and 80's stayed in DC..further there was psych testimony that men that are abused as children have a tendency to become the worst kinds of rapest and are more likely to rape babies and even younger children.  The Franklin situation and the Finders situation created the NIGHTMARE that operates in plain sit in DC...dollars to donuts Alefantis was a Franklin/Finders kid...

             Yeah, I believe he might have been sold off by his father/family to glean favors.  The father and he have been mentioned as CIA.  I believe the father is living in Alaska.  Hmm.  Is he in charge of the operations there perhaps.

            All I have to say after looking all of this over is:  Who is going to file the RICO case. MAFIA  It is so obvious as to how to solve this, but who will take the steps to actually start the ball rolling.  That is the hard question.

             I'm assuming the ship has sailed on RICO'ing this... very old case. Who knows what/who is still active from the original information provided? It was certainly telling that the investigators at the time still had much work to do, unwilling to divulge some of their leads at the time. One can assume that the investigation was shutdown. They got their fall guys, prosecuted them and poof... out of the news and into the shadows.

              It can be used today though.   But it seems the feet are being dragged at the slowest possible speed.  They are doing everything they did then only on a much grander scale.

            One of the first quality posts on pizzagate today. Almost every post that was upvoated to the top was disinfo or shill accounts with one submission who later deleted their accounts. THIS SUB wil lfall so start downloading everything!

             Thanks! Yeah... the sub has been getting hit hard. Fortunately, for those of us still active/in the know, it's easy to sift through the garbage and see what matters.

             I tried doing that on CNN.com today and came up with nothing. All garbage. At least we still have CNN beat for now.

              Attempts to discredit sub by creating a semblance of antisemitism. If you call out the tactic you are mercilessly hounded. I have just gotten to the downvoat and move on stage with it, seems that not too many fall for it anymore.

              His game is so obvious it's tedious. He's here to discredit. Everyone on this sub knows it's not "teh Joooooz ZOMG!!! But we have a couple of posters (or maybe one with two names) who have obviously been tasked with discrediting the important work being done here by trying to make the community seem like the "alt-right." Just downvoat and ignore them.

               PG never enjoyed ANY CREDIBILITY TO BEGIN WITH because of Jewish media organizations, you stupid fuck.  Your simplistic, arrogant, holier-than-thou attitude makes you a faggot and a bad person.

               I know, but I want him to put his money where his mouth is. He's offering to prove that, in my particular post, he can prove that "Jews are overrepresented by a factor of 2500 in this list".

              <p>
               I've accepted his challenge.

               An exercise in futility? Perhaps.

               People like Bush Sr and Jr are not jews, but they both enjoy screwing kids and who knows what else.

               Are they not Luciferians?

               Besides, a lot of jews could have been saved in WW2, but they were left to die.  It seems like the people we are against don't like jews that much.

                Why do you think "Holocaust" means sacrifice, i.e. to Moloch?  The sympathy generated by that fake genocide has enabled the brainwashing you currently see in this thread.  Dont you see they admittedly see the charge of antisemitism as the worst sin ever LOL? And they implicitly admit the public is brainwashed  by claiming it is bad optics! This is while implicitly admitting that the media, run by Jews, wishes to propagandize against us!
               </p>
               <p>
                It could NOT be clearer!

                 I see your point.  I am also aware of blood libel and other issues, and I know it is all real.  I am familiar with the Talmud, too.  I have been called an anti-Semite plenty of times by people that want to shut down the discussion.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I understand your point of view.  I just don't see how people like Bush Sr. and Jr. can be considered Jews.  I think we all agree that Bush Sr. and Jr. are part of the problem, but what are they exactly?  If you believe they are Jews, then fine.  I just wonder if there is a more accurate description, and I have legitimate reasons for wondering that.
                </p>
                <p>
                 For example, I believe that it was the Jesuits who were behind the Bolshevik Revolution and the slaughter of 65 million people in the Slavic countries.  There was also the Holodomor in Ukraine.  The Jesuits wanted to destroy the Russian Orthodox church and the Slavic people.  It seems like they also wanted to destroy Judaism throughout Europe.  The "Jewish" bankers, like the Rothschilds, could have saved millions of Jews from the holocaust, but they let them die instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You are right about the meaning of "Holocaust", and sacrificing to Moloch.  I guess my question is what is the difference between the Jews that were sacrificed to Moloch and the "Jews" (i.e. Rothschilds, Royal Family, International bankers, etc.) that caused the sacrificing?

                  There is wide agreement that the earliest Jesuits were marrano crypto jews, from what ive seen.  Jews hate russia more than any country because of their history there, and Marxism is absolutely a Jwwish ideology, they proudly admit it.  I dont feel the need to theorize why they let SOME number (not many millions) of jews die -- collateral damage, sacrifice for permanent propaganda value, classism, doesnt matter since the evidence is clear that they are sabotaging white countries.

                Whereas you think it's falling into a trap to even mention Jews, because the media will make us look bad. But the media is controlled by Jews. What a conundrum, I am sure YOU think, you stupid asshole. LOL!

                So if Jews are overrepresented by a factor of 2500 in this list, what do i win? Will you fuck off for being a sentimental retard unfit for research?

                 You win a discussion. And to stop whatever it is you are doing.

                 Dig my friend! Let's see the "Jew Factor"! I'm legitimately curious.
