             If you are talking about actually getting organized and doing something, I'm not a figurehead for "Pizzagate" as it has a lot of different definitions to different people. AND THAT'S FINE. Seriously.
            </p>
            <p>
             I just have my own niche and I have always maintained that, if you want to get these people, you start with Uranium One. Forget Pizzagate for a minute. Just look at the Russian money trail. It is really, really easy to break down.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whatever your personal political opinion is, the only way to get the answers here is through government transparency. No matter which side of the aisle, this is what you should be asking your politicians for. LET'S START THERE. Do you have a list of people a TRANSPARENCY movement could complain to about policy? Their emails? Their addresses to write letters? Their phone numbers? Who are these people in charge and how can we politely contact them to ask about these kinds of things. Has anyone tried that?
            </p>
            <p>
             I have EVERYONE's email addresses. You want some specific lists that would help a truth movement? Email blasts? As long as it's done politely, and if everyone can play nice, to push for change.
            </p>
            <p>
             These online corners have been divided hard and the divisive targeting is only going to get worse. Are you actually ready for that?
            </p>
            <p>
             If so, then you go ahead and get ready to create a TRUTH CULT to get to the bottom of things and get justice and it isn't a short quick road and it isn't a passive effort.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you use the inverse of their tricks to 'demagick' or 'deprogram' or whatever you want to call it, in a focused manner, a small but determined group of people can raise a lot of awareness. Do you have any type  of awareness campaigns? Do you know how many people marched at The White March? It was the response to the Dutroux case. This problem is nothing new.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you start with Uranium One, and work your way out, you can, in a non-controversial way, take down every single player in which ever version of "Pizzagate" makes sense to you.
            </p>
            <p>
             Despite a mountain of evidence, people are going to keep calling you crazy; but, not if you start with Uranium One.
            </p>
            <p>
             Beyond that: If you see a crime, report a crime. You are allowed to report crimes anonymously as long as you are doing it in good faith. Don't jump to wild conclusions. Connect the dots, for yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you want to talk about focus and direction, I think that's great. Just know that I have no desire for any type of control or responsibility for
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/Pizzagate">
              /v/Pizzagate
             </a>
             , itself. That's why I recommend we have a dialogue before you start taking steps that will draw all the wrong attention.
            </p>
            <p>
             Point being, a plan should be implemented in stages that starts with Ian Telfer  et al &gt; Clinton et al, and Ruben Vardanyan et al &gt; Podesta et al.
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you see why my advice is not necessarily Pizzagate related, but it might be the best way to bring focus to the problem? IT DESTROYS THE MEDIA NARRATIVE. I've been saying it for years.
            </p>
            <p>
             Let me know what you think. Good night.

              And do you know why it stopped there? Because people found that their whole society is totally corrupt, and government and the judciary system is full of pedos, and people got killed. And they were not able to find a starting point for creating a new system.

                Yes, it is still on their minds, but I was talking about why the public action stopped.

                My impression has been that people just don't know how to start building a new society. And the language and culture split in Belgium doesn't really help.

               I don't mean be actual cult members. I mean an anti-cult.
              </p>
              <p>
               I've made hundreds of reports starting in about 2014, when, in an unrelated matter, someone had stolen a firearm from me and paid off the DA to bury a police report. I tangled with a corrupt local system, was placed in a confidential location by DA Victim Witness, with my family, and eventually saw a limited hangout operate in my face, but resulted in resignations, failure to win elections and a documentary that was releases recently, tangentially related, is "Murder Mountain."
              </p>
              <p>
               I got a business and a non-profit shut down by reporting them to the FBI, because (I feel) they want their cut. You just need to tell them when they aren't getting it. Anonymously. The IRS also wants their cut and, on this initial effort, I merely used an alias to report to the IRS. This resulted in a seizure of millions of dollars in assets.
              </p>
              <p>
               This situation is why I know how to do this. This is where I first discovered that the corrupt people, even in local government, were all part of a weird swingers club. The DA's son was openly soliciting sex and nudes from 12 and 13 year old girls and nobody was doing anything. This situation was why, when Pizzagate broke, I was already under the impression this was happening everywhere.
              </p>
              <p>
               As far as my success goes, I went from being homeless and jobless because my family was being terrorized and my windows were getting smashed and my tires were getting slashed on a regular basis. I was having to deal with violence and I was put in a position where I had no choice but to fight back; to where I am today, which is with a house by the beach and a cabin by the ski lift and the luxury of not having to work if I don't want to.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm no one to fuck with.
