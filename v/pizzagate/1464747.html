<p>&quot;The book was neither fun nor cute. I just read it to my almost 4 year old and cringed as I read: &quot;When you make something secret, you make it special.&quot; Yeah, that\'s not what I want to teach my child. It sounds like something a pedophile would say to their victim. ... This could have been a fun cute book, but it really missed the mark. I don\'t expect all books to preach moral lessons to my children, but when they specifically encourage keeping secrets and make a joke out of stealing from a store I am not impressed.&quot; - Feb 2015</p>
<p>&quot;I was very unsettled by the book\'s characterization of secrets to young children - &quot;When you make something secret, you make it special.&quot; I probably watched too many after school specials growing up, but it just didn\'t sit well with me.&quot; - October 2014</p>
<p>That lead me to his other books..</p>

<p>&quot;I was excited to give this to my five year old son after seeing the demo on the website and reading the rave reviews. I read it before giving it to him and it\'s a total disappointment. Kid squirts robo sauce on stuff and they turn into robots. No adventures being robots, nothing. The story just ends.&quot; - December 2015</p>
<p>&quot;This book is not for a four year old, nor a five year old, I suspect. I found it to be too clever by a half ... In fact, I found it very difficult to read. The notion that there\'s this sort of gun-like thing that shoots &quot;Robo Sauce&quot; is also very odd and, for those who are looking to keep guns and gun-like objects out of children\'s stories, unwelcome.&quot; - October 2015</p>

            Dragons love tacos is also really weird, pedophile network oriented. "they love big gigantic tacos and tiny little baby tacos as well", "if you want to make friend with dragons, tacos are key",  'dragon love parties,like costume parties (satanists) and pool parties (hollywood)", with mentions of burying in the garden, burning a house...

            Every parents that love these books of Adam Rubin agree on the fact that it is really absurd and weird and funny (because of absurdity), but once you get the code to decrypt them...

            Secret Pizza Party -The mayor of NY read this to kids. It seems like a form of grooming.
           </p>
           <p>
            "When you make something secret, you make it special. Regular handshake, boring. Secret handshake, boo Yah! Regular staircase? Tiring. Secret staircase, terrific."
           </p>
           <p>
            The raccoon is obsessed with obtaining pizza and eating it in secret. He doesn't want to order pizza over the phone because the delivery man might recognize his face from a Wanted poster. He steals pizza and runs home dodging brooms that have been used by people to stop him from getting pizza. He dodges robot sniffer brooms, which seems like a reference to electronic monitoring or something. When he was getting pizza alone he was timid, scared, careful. When he stole the pizza and ran home he avoided the broom enthusiasm club which was stationed in a neoclassical style building similar to the government buildings in DC. At home he was scared of being caught so he turned off the lights and whispered. He says pizza gives him happy screams but forces himself to contain his excitement for safety purposes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then he notices a secret pizza party outside that's loud and out in the open. Adults and children in an open air tent with masks on, some black and similar to his own natural raccoon mask. There is a large sign announcing SECRET PIZZA PARTY (very non-secretive.) He says these people are better at giving parties than keeping secrets. He goes, is still timid, secretive but is overwhelmed by the party and rolls around on the central pizza table with a slice of pizza covering his genitals.
           </p>

            Robo Sauce - this seems to have themes of dissociation which can be an outcome of sexual abuse. It also suggests drugging kids with Robo Sauce and ideas of the abused becoming the abuser to spread their isolation. Here is a repost of my sarcastic take on the book's themes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hey kids wouldn't you like to become a robot? Everyone would want to play with you then! You would be so cool! Just take a few spoonfuls of this cough syrup looking stuff and you can be a robot we can play with! Rub it all over your body! Now it's working! Now you can do all the cool stuff you couldn't do before you were our robot! It's more fun to be a robot than a sqishy human. Oh no, your friends don't like you now you're a robot and if you try to hug your parents you'll kill them. People don't want to play with robots after all! So then the kid is offered a chance to return to human but chooses instead to turn those around him into robots, including his dog. If you abuse those around you they will be just like you. So the robo kids covers the world in robo sauce, using some vaguely phallic looking contraption, transforming everyone into a robot. "The end is near. The end."
           </p>
           <p>
            Who the fuck reads that to kids?
           </p>
           <p>
            That is some creepy mind control shit with liberal doses of "you better not tell anyone you're being abused or they will hate you and your parents will die."

              At 1:56 in Robo Sauce there is a recipe for super secret robo-sauce which turns kids into robots. The are 3 codes in the bowl of ingredients. Two of them correspond to imprint codes for drugs which cause drowsiness. The third corresponds to a HD web camera model.
             </p>
             <p>
              C56 is the drug code for paroxetine aka Paxil, an antidepressant which can cause drowsiness.
              <a href="https://www.drugs.com/imprints/c-5-6-14508.html">
               https://www.drugs.com/imprints/c-5-6-14508.html
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              C27 is guaifenesin/phenylephrine which is for chest congestion and can cause drowsiness.
              <a href="https://www.drugs.com/imprints/c27-18535.html">

             </p>
             <p>
              C92/0 - couldn't find a imprint code for that or C92 or C920, but Logitech does make a C920 HD Pro Web Camera...the idea is to drug them up and put on a show maybe? Who knows?

             As I was reading this to my husband I could not stop shouting  Oh My God!! after every 3 or 4 sentences.  What the hell is going on in this country when we are banning books about slavery and letting crap like this be published for our little children?  I have grand children and I can tell you I would have left one hell of a blistering review of this horrible sick book on the seller's site.

              Seems the NY mayor book reading of SPP was mentioned in the wikileaks.

               That's where I read it before!   I tried to read as many  emails as I could and have followed Wikileaks and Snowden's twitters almost every day.  My husband thinks I am nuts.  He hates all the stuff they are doing but thinks nothing will come of it.  I have more faith in you guys and wish I could help more.  I am not very tech savvy but will try to help wherever I can.  I hate to think that DeBlasio is involved, but I know that he ran HRC Senate campaign.  I think we are going to have to realize that some of those that we thought were OK just simply are not.Anyone is suspect at this point.
