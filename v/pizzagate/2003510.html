<p>I\'ve posted several threads over the last week about how the mysterious Natalia Veselnitskaya was an expert on the William Browder case. <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/salvadorhernandez/veselnitskaya-conspiracy-theory?bftwnews&amp;utm_term=.ssZaW64vjV#.oojQy23NVk">A Buzzfeed article</a>, dated June 15, 2016, quotes Natalia saying she worked extensively on the Browder case and filed a report to the U.S. Congress on how William Browder deceived the U.S. Congress in the evidence he presented in 2012 for the passage of the Magnitsky Act:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The representatives of one of US House subcommittees attended the screening last night, and told me that if I have something to say, I could file a report as a Russian lawyer,” Veselnitskaya said on Tuesday, adding that she has spent some two years working with the documents related to Browder. “I filed a written report today. I am qualified to talk about it as a lawyer, and I am stating that I know the facts that can help the Congress to figure out this complicated story.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently, Natalia\'s knowledge of the Browder case is also linked to Hillary Clinton\'s dealings with corrupt Russian officials. Could William Browder have provided guidance or counseling to Hillary from his own vast experience defrauding the Russian govt? Was this the information Natalia was bringing to Donald Trump, Jr? </p>
<p>Natalia\'s NGO, HRAGIF, which was allegedly set up as a lobbying organization for the restarting of Russian adoptions, provided a useful cover both for her meeting with Donald, Jr., and for her activities in Washington afterwards. Natalia and several allies worked to spread an alternate explanation of William Browder\'s dealings with the Russian government and organized a screening of an anti-Magnitsky Act documentary in Washington.</p>
<p>Donald Jr could point to her segue during the meeting to Russian adoptions as the reason why the meeting was inconsequential and nonproductive. After the meeting, Natalia could go to Washington and use her NGO as a way to wheedle lawmakers into making changes to the Magnitsky Act. In the words of Daily Beast reporter Michael Wyss who was on to Natalia\'s act last May, as he reports in an article entitled &quot;Putin\'s Dirty Game in the U.S.Congress&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;disadvantaged Russian children are being dangled as bait, with a wink-and-a-nudge promise to have the Russian law (Magnitsky Act) rescinded if the American law is taken off the books.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kyle Parker, who has recently been outed in the State Dept. hacked emails as a correspondent with William Browder, tweeted confirmation of this opinion yesterday: </p>
<blockquote>
<h1>Putin tactic of holding #Russia\'s most vulnerable kids hostage was used more than once--in this case, successfully.</h1>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kyleparkernet/status/886603550364663810">https://twitter.com/kyleparkernet/status/886603550364663810</a></p>
<p>However, Natalia\'s scheme to use restarting of the &quot;popular&quot; Russian adoption program fell flat early on. Unnamed sources in <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/341788-exclusive-doj-let-russian-lawyer-into-us-before-she-met-with-trump">a The Hill article</a> scornfully described Natalia\'s lobbying efforts in Washington last year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Don’t let anyone tell you this was a sophisticated lobbying effort. It was the least professional campaign I’ve ever seen. If she’s the cream of the Moscow intelligence community then we have nothing to worry about.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the liberal elite in Washington weren\'t fooled by Natalia and were making careful notes about her activities, esp. about the screening of the anti-Magnitsky Act film. Their suspicions of Natalia and her allies, lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, and the Russian filmmaker, Andrei Nekrasov, are the basis of a highly detailed <a href="https://www.grassley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/judiciary/upload/Russia,%2003-31-17,%20Magnitsky%20Act%20-%202016-%2007-15%20HCM%20Complaint%20to%20FARA%20(003)_Redacted.pdf">complaint made by Senator Grassley</a> that her NGO was a clever front to disguise her real motive---the repeal of the Magnitsky Act and the de-railing of the Global Magnitsky Act. So convinced is the Browder/Grassley 
coalition that it was a false cover to seek support for undermining the Magnitsky Act that they are seeking criminal charges against Natalia\'s associates.</p>
<p>Further evidence has come out that, contrary to popular belief by Trump supporters, Natalia\'s alleged &quot;anti-Trump&quot; Facebook posts are actually sharply worded criticisms of the Women\'s March and anti-Trump supporters. One of her Facebook post also celebrates Neil Gorsuch\'s SCOTUS nomination----which doesn\'t jive with an anti-Trump/Deep State shill profile at all.</p>
<p>Kyle Parker, who is mentioned above, <a href="https://twitter.com/kyleparkernet/status/885692911500898304">tweeted</a> four days ago that a photo he took last year sparked the current Russia collusion conspiracy theory and links to a <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/salvadorhernandez/veselnitskaya-conspiracy-theory?bftwnews&amp;utm_term=.kiG5KqmpvN#.qjjv856yXZ">Buzzfeed article</a> entitled &quot;How A False Conspiracy Theory About The Russian Lawyer Who Met With Don Jr. Spread To Trump&quot; wherein claims that she posted anti-Trump Facebook tweets are debunked. What Natalia actually said about the Women\'s March:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It\'s all about abortions, homosexuality, illegal immigration and two presidents,&quot; she wrote in Russian. &quot;Whatever the order is, but for those who don\'t understand — that\'s what\'s called \'human rights.\'&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In light of recent articles and further information, I\'m going to stand with my hunch 8 days ago that Natalia is not a Deep State/Soros operative. It\'s pretty well established now that she used her foundation to work for a pro-Russian agenda (overturning the Magnitsky Act) and may have intended to use her pro-Russian adoption foundation as a way to lure possible pedophiles and traffickers into a trap, but it was detected early on by William Browder\'s team as a false front.  Can\'t prove this entirely yet, but further developments will no doubt be unfolding that could potentially shed more light on that aspect.</p>

            Why do you say that?  You've agreed to a meeting to accept ultra-sensitive information from the Russian Government who are trying to affect our election.  That is collusion and the specific crimes would be conspiracy and election law violations.

             I don't believe any of this was criminal in the least
The emails promise high level and "ultra-sensitive" official government documents as part of the Russian government's support for Mr. Trump.   Once you agreed to meet, you've committed a crime.
Kushner committed an additional crime by not revealing this meeting on his SF-86 questionnaire. 
If Ivanka knew about this meeting and she didn't reveal it on her SF-86 questionnaire, she committed a crime.

            You also still seem to willing to give them the benefit of the doubt of believing their cover story.  A benefit they should have forfeited by the 5th time they have lied about.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you remember later meetings end up with Kushner asking senior officials to communicate secretly with Russia using Russia communications systems.  I believe these two meetings were part of the ongoing conspiracy.

             The Master of ‘Kompromat’ Believed to Be Behind Trump Jr.’s Meeting
            </p>
            <p>
             MOSCOW — The salacious video, of a naked man in bed with two women, was one of the most prominent examples of “kompromat,” the Russian art of spreading damaging information to discredit a rival or an enemy, in recent Russian history.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was made available to Russian state television in the late 1990s and authenticated in public by Yuri Y. Chaika, Russia’s prosecutor general, who at 66 has a long and storied background in kompromat. Mr. Chaika benefited from the video, as it destroyed a predecessor as prosecutor general, Yuri I. Skuratov, who had been looking into suspicions of corruption by President Boris N. Yeltsin and his associates.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Chaika (pronounced CHIKE-uh) is also the man who is widely considered to have been the source of the incriminating information on Hillary Clinton that Donald Trump Jr. was promised at a meeting last June in Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer and a Russian-American lobbyist. And yet, oddly, the accusations brought to New York fell flat, by the accounts of those present, despite their having originated from such a seasoned master of kompromat.

            So she was pretending to want to re-open the adoption program, but she really didn't.  She was only pretending that because she knew that is what the Obama adm. wanteded to do.....to reopen the Adoption program.  and that is why they gave her a visa to get in the country .  Then why is nobody in the adm admitting to letting her in?
           </p>
           <p>
            Was she only pretending to be anti-Trump on her facebook page...so she could fool the Obama admin?
           </p>
           <p>
            So, are you saying the the Obama admin got duped by her?  Are you saying they are that dumb?
What did Bill Clinton talk to Lynch about on the tarmac. It wasn't about Hillary, because the fix to exonerate her was in from the beginning. .

            This is kind of like investigating the OJ Simpson case while ignoring the statements of the Brown family
           </p>
           <p>
            The opposing viewpoint in this case is a PR strategy to retroactively rewrite what happened, however it's not supported by the facts and makes no sense. And this opposing viewpoint was only created after the cover-up fell apart and journalists traced where the money wound up.

            And just like in the OJ case, you don't have to rely on Browser, there's plenty of other evidence.  It's not just Browder.  There's lots of reporting from at that time and since to back up Browder.  Remember Magnistky reported this crime.  He was the one who blew the whistle.  It was a tax fraud case involving huge paper  losses that had to be approved by tax officials.  It was approved and the refund was grantly instantly.  No audit was done and $230 million dollars from the Russian Treasury walked out the door. . The only way this works is if the tax officials are in on it. The tax officials were not arrested, Magnistky, the whistleblower and victim was. The money didn't go back to Magnistky or Browder, it went to a bunch of shell companies one of which was controlled by the ex husband of the tax officials who approved the theft.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's tons of other Russian and contemporaneous sources on this including Boris Nemtsov the murdered opposition leader and an initial Russian human rights investigation that found Magnistky's arrest was illegal and that he was beaten right before his death,

            Natalia was using the adoption angle in a completely cyncical way for only one reason: to make it easier for Putin's cronies to move their money around the globe. Have you read about the fraud at the center of the Magnistky Act?  It exposes how deeply corrupt Russia under Putin is.  Putin hates the Magnistky Act because exposes this, the fraud at the center of it only works if both high level Kremlin officials and judges are in on it.  Did you miss this part from the Michael Weiss article?

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Since the passage of the Magnitsky Act, much of the looted $230 million has been found or frozen. Some was in Swiss and Latvian bank accounts; some was in offshore companies technically “owned” by Russian concert cellist Sergei Roldugin (who happens to be Putin’s best friend), and some was even in six-figure condos in Manhattan.
            </p>

           <p>
            This is why Putin is pissed.

             Far from a fight against globalists, NV is fighting these sanctions because they hit the gangsters in government and make it harder for them to move their stolen money out of Russia and into New York and London real estate..  They very much want to be globalist and launder their money outside of Russia, and this makes it harder for them to do so.

            She may or may not be, but  She is not the key, at least not now.  The key is that she was either used or participated in a set up meeting with Trump.

             Obviously she participated in that pictures prove she is anti-Trump, but then tries to give damning evidence of Hillary straight to Trumps son. That cannot be believed. This is propaganda to get Lynch off and to stop the possibility of dominoes falling.

            Right? You fail to address why the MSM would essentially be doing Putin's bidding which they obviously would never do.

            There's a famous expression in the medical field: "If you hear hoof beats thinks Horses not Zebras.". That means the simplest and most likely explanation is almost always the correct one, i.e. Ocum's Razor. The simplest explanation that explains her story and frankly the past 9 months is Hillary &amp; Co are, duh, trying to say the Russian's Hacked the election.

            Why do you think there is a coalition?   Grassley seems to not have done anything about this last year, and this year is using this complaint to cast doubt on the motives of the Trump meeting.

            Are you saying that she was not working for Lynch? Or she was not being used by Obama/Hillary/ Lynch to gain access to Trump Tower?  Somewhere I read that the reason Bill met Lynch on the tarmac was to relay all the info they had ILLEGALLY, gathered on Trump, not for Bill to convince Lynch to protect Hillary from charges.  That does make a whole lot more sense.  The fix for Hillary was going to happen no matter what.  Bill had no reason to try to persuade Lynch.  She was giving him all the info they got from tapping Trump Tower.  A visit by the Russians was the excuse they use to tap the Tower.

            Lynch got her a visa, Pd for her to be put up in a house in NY, ect..  Lynch had her followed.
HillPedo and her cohorts would have outed Trump long ago, if this was Trump's doing!
You are wrong, Trump is not involved! 
Trump would not do anything illegal. Trump had more than enough Pedo shit on these MFkers to cook up a half baked scheme with 2 bit players!

            the problem with this theory is the parole entry. I know you are keeping track and posting on this subject but there is just too much conflicting and missing info. Her whole story is baffling and isn't there still another person at the "meeting" not yet identified? I'm still not seeing how she is functioning as a lawyer in a federal case without speaking english or bar license.

            Oh My God, when will this ever end?  I still see it on TV News every day.  They are trying to get all they can out of this story.  Thanks

            for another wonderful and intriguing post.  I don't know what to think anymore.  I will hold off on my thoughts because this has me so darned confused.  But don't worry, they will drag this out for another few weeks.  More to come I am sure. UpVoat4U

             Really? The MSM wouldn't be doing Putin's bidding after spending the past 9 months trying to blame Hillary's loss on Russian Hackers. The whole story is laughable and given the fact AreWeSure thinks she's working for Putin and is pro Trump is all the evidence you need to see through this charade.
