            On the Howard Stern show during the 1993 allegations Latoya Jackson argued with Feldman and stated that Michael Jackson really did not like Feldman and actually annoyed by him. I could easily believe that.
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/mjvictims">
             @mjvictims
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Feldman accused Michael Jackson of having damaged his childhood by befriending and then abandoning him. The two had become close after Feldman found fame as a young star in Gremlins, The Goonies, and Stand by Me. Feldman admitted Jackson helped many children by becoming a friend and mentor – but Feldman claimed Jackson did more harm than good, by dropping kids when he grew bored with them. The actor said, "He did real damage in my overall life. I was a 12-year-old boy who was hurt by his family and ignored by people at school. Michael would sit and talk to me for hours and he would listen. Then he would get bored. The biggest thing that Michael's done to children is befriending the ones that are in need and then abandoning them."[30]
           </p>
           <p>
            When Jackson died, Feldman dedicated a Los Angeles hospital concert with his rock band Truth Movement to the singer. Feldman told the crowd Jackson was watching over the show. "I didn't feel I could pull myself together to do a show tonight," Feldman told People magazine after the show. "It's been really difficult, honestly. I'm all shaken up right now. I had to do a lot of acting, basically, to get through the last 48 hours". Of the events of the week Jackson died, said Feldman, "It was shocking, and I think I'm still in shock, to an extent. I don't think I have fully, completely come to terms with it yet. I have waves and flashes. One moment, I feel fine and I'm myself. Then all of a sudden, it hits me, and I go, 'Wow, he's really gone.' It's very troubling."[31]

            Wiki got it from Feldmans book
           </p>
           <p>
            Feldman is starting to creep me out, Seems he likes to promote himself, and I think he uses the Haim card to monetize himself
           </p>
           <p>
            Guess I'm no longer on the fence about him, The only thing he has said, that he has said over and over, that I believe is " I can't name names"

               I hear you, but I think he has actually done a lot, and I'm really hoping this whole movie business he's talking about ends up helping the cause, cuz I agree it seems a little odd, but what really gets me is his angels, I think the whole thing is creepy.  but I have empathy for what he's been through and for the fact that his family members' lives are probably in danger the closer he gets to saying anything. I think he has a young daughter.  he is likely putting her life in danger the more he says.
              </p>
              <p>
               in the book, corey talks about how Michael was nothing but a friend to him, but that there was a fallout, which I believe happened around 9/11 and relates to corey feeling Michael j was getting paranoid and I think started feeling he couldn't trust Corey... i can't remember if he thought corey had said something about him, or what it was, but it was something mild and indirect.  Corey knew things weren't right when MJ had three big busses going out of new York right after 9/11, and corey got on one of them, and supposedly MJ made him get off, via message delivered through a sibling, I think.  it was made clear to him that Michael no longer considered him a trusted friend, and Corey was very surprised.

                 I don't think i'll be disappointed either way.  but I do have hope this evil will keep getting exposed.  and corey Feldman highly criticized Charlie sheen, which makes me think he's one of the guilty parties

            Like any profession their are individuals that know how to do their job and individuals who dont. I believe the officers who interviewed Corey Feldman at the time should of followed up on Corey Feldman's accusations about other individuals he named. However that is no way means that Michael Jackson did not rape children.  The case that this news clip is referring to is the Chandler case.  A case that Jackson settled for over 15 million dollars.  A case in which his lawyers insisted that the parents and their spouses be paid Millions to not be able to speak publicly. In this case Jackson actually showed up at the child's home and slept in the child's bed for almost a month. The accuser in this case accurately described the underside of MJ'S genitals and when the pictures and child's drawings were found to be a match. Michael Jackson's own defense attorney Carl Douglas said it was the 600-pound gorilla in the room and they knew that they had to silence the child to prevent a criminal trial. After close to five years of research on this trial I do not believe that Jackson sexually abused Feldman.  On the Howard Stern show during the 1993 allegations Latoya Jackson argued with Feldman and stated that Michael Jackson really did not like Feldman and actually annoyed by him. I could easily believe that. Corey Feldman did not also fit the physical characteristics that Jackson wanted. 
   Feldman in this interview stated that he would of immediately gone to authorities if Jackson had harmed him. However by his own admission he did not immediately go to authorities when the men he is accusing now raped him. The authorities came to him looking to question him on the Jackson case and it was than that he gave them the names. Also Corey Feldman knew about Marty Weiss for decades before Weiss was arrested.  He even thanked Weiss at an award show that Marty Weiss had organized for child actors and said nothing. So what this tape shows is bad police work but it is far from a vindication of the 1993 accusations of Michael Jackson.

             It's quite possible you are right on all of this. Just because one person was not raped or molested by someone doesn't mean others weren't as well. Feldman was kinda annoying as a kid and definitely not as cute as the other child actors at the time. I hate to think of Mj as a pedo but it seems to be true. And can't forget Brice Taylor's claim of seeing MJ sodomized himself as a little boy

             I have heard that Michael jackson was castrated as a child to keep his high pitches singing voice. Which explains why he could not produce his own offspring.  Also that he was purchasing children from their abusive and opportunistic parents to liberate them. MJ accused David Gefen of worshipping the devil publicly. Corey feldman Is adamant that Michael Jackson was not an abuser. I am willing to look at all sides of the issue, back then I believed the main stream media and their spin on Michael Jackson however knowing what I know today: about the music industry, child exploitation, and satanism I am willing to entertain alternate theories. We know that sandy hook was staged, we know LV massacre was a set up, whose to say the MJ scandal was not a set up? Especially when he died under such mysterious circumstances. Who knows what the truth is, this definitely deserves some research!
