<p>Other accounts state that the Canadian government is to be blamed for the children being taken away, but for the children to never be seen again is extremely unnerving. What happened to them? How could Serge\'s wife never get in touch with them again? Not much information is available, but this situation embodies most of what we\'re seeing now with people such as Andrew Breitbart, who was speaking out about the globalists, then dying of a heart attack at the age of 47 when he\'d just received a shining health report from his doctor. </p>
<p>Part of Project Blue Beam is said to be able to cause heart attacks and diseases in individuals without even being near them. Considering secret weapon tech, this all sounds like magic and sci fi to me, which essentially reminds me of Spirit Cooking and other ways of attacking people without being directly in contact with them. </p>
<p><em>[Note: Serge Monast [1945 - December 5, 1996] and another journalist, both of whom were researching Project Blue Beam, died of &quot;heart attacks&quot; within weeks of each other although neither had a history of heart disease. Serge was in Canada. The other Canadian journalist was visiting Ireland. Prior to his death, the Canadian government abducted Serge\'s daughter in an attempt to dissuade him from pursuing his research into Project Blue Beam. His daughter was never returned. Pseudo-heart attacks are one of the alleged methods of death induced by Project Blue Beam.]</em> <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/cn/projectbluebeam25jul05.shtml">http://educate-yourself.org/cn/projectbluebeam25jul05.shtml</a></p>
<p>Considering all that is believed to encompass Project Blue Beam, I feel that the globalists need our children as various types of fodder to make their plans materialize. </p>
<ol>
<li>Use the abducted child to get the parent to stop researching and/or speaking out</li>
<li>Use the abducted child as a means of blackmailing those who oppose their plans</li>
<li>Use the abducted child to satiate themselves and those they\'re in league with either through sex slavery, blood &amp; energetic harvest, payment &amp; bartering, etc.</li>
<li>Use the abducted child to experiment on either genetically or as a target for the various secret weapons that are physical and psychological</li>
<li>Use the abducted child for blood transfusions and organs to prolong their own lives, and sell whatever they don\'t need to those who can afford it</li>
</ol>
<p>While I\'m still trying to uncover more information about Monast\'s children, I believe this is a perfect example of how the globalists work in order to keep their agenda moving forward. They will use any ridiculous reason they can think of to remove the children from their families, and kill anyone who gets in their way. It\'s a good thing that Breitbart didn\'t have children. Are there other examples of the globalists doing what they did to Monast, but we haven\'t scrutinized this avenue? </p>
<p>As Monast\'s situation is related to the Canadian government, let\'s not forget that they have declared that children be removed from families who won\'t allow them to be subjected to gender reassignment initiatives. It\'s clear to see that they will invent any reason to remove children from their family\'s care if it suits their agenda. </p>
<p>Scary times we are living in. If anyone is able to find more info about the kidnapping of the Monast children, or any other instances similar to this situation, please post. Thanks in advance.</p>',

            Something strikes me as odd about this story.  There is no follow up on his widow or children in any of the searches so far/cept one mention in poor health and out of money.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reading more on project bb it was supposed to happen several times, by 2000 for sure, but nada.
           </p>
           <p>
            Occupy wallstreet was infiltrated.  Many movements including pg are infiltrated.  Is it possible that Serge was infiltration?  Sure, maybe going out on a limb but just very strange nothing about his widow or children (cept gone forever).  Wouldn't it seem like the mother would be raising hell?  Threat of death?  Well, according to the story she lost everything anyway/what would stop her?
           </p>
           <p>
            Just what if PBB is designed to do something much different but the story line presently is to distract?  You know, the look in the direction other than where being pointed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Could Serge have been a creation of an alphabet agency?  After all, the last US potus was a cia fabrication fake id's and all.  Said one thing and took ppl off in another direction.
           </p>

            Something is just not adding up here...just sayin :)

             I hear what you're saying, so let me explain how I stumbled on to this. I believe that what we're seeing with fake news and CNN is part of Project Blue Beam, which is why I was researching this when I came across Monast's story. I actually just found this and have added it to the main thread, so maybe we actually do know what might have sadly happened to his children:
             <a href="http://www.azquotes.com/picture-quotes/quote-classification-of-christian-children-as-they-plan-it-are-to-be-used-as-human-sacrifice-serge-monast-67-9-0943.jpg">

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             I think Monast's info is being well buried and the propaganda has made it so people feel ashamed to even say they're researching Project Blue Beam, so info is few and far between. I'm still looking into this and will post any new info I find.

              Ah, yes, very possible.  Could it even be that he was fed info that it was going to happen (the stuff in the sky) on several dates that came and went so it would all look like a huge tin foil spiracy.  He could have even been fed the info via mind beaming/one  thing PBB can do/or a supposed inside source that purposefully led him in a diff direction.  I don't know anything about him to know where he came up with the dates for PBB to happen.

              And of course this ties in with the oh so generous gov giving away all the free or nearly free antennas for the new digital tv's.  I knew something was up with that.  We don't watch tv, an occasional movie on dvd...and tv is old school not digital.

              ps...hope you can find out what happened to the widow.  That would bring some clues.  So far I can't find out anything about her.

               Thanks, and I believe that the whole fake news thing is an experiment to see how many people believe what they're reporting, and when it's revealed that it's not real, how many people still believe and defend it. Not sure if it's true, but CNN is saying their ratings are up, which would be an indicator to them as to who would most likely fall for the projected images they have planned. Plus, it's not difficult to make the connection of Blue Beam to the blue light that is emitted from the TV.
              </p>
              <p>
               Considering all the earthquakes we're seeing reported, man made earthquakes are supposed to be part of Blue Beam. I also saw today that Facebook had a fake article about Yellowstone erupting lava, and it was getting a lot of attention. Facebook is certainly being used as a gauge to see what people will fall for.
              </p>
              <p>
               Interesting times we're living in, so we all need to keep our wits about us. I do believe that Monast was uncovering a huge plan that they're preparing us for.
              </p>
              <p>
               I do find it interesting that as more and more people are waking up to Pizza/Pedogate, the earthquakes are also ramping up.

                Manmade earthquakes absolutely.  More often than not imho the earthquakes are manufactured.  Did you see the tubes from Japan where supposedly it was the earthquake as it happened?  There was no massive eq.  Planned demolition, tsunami, some theories bc Japan got out of line and was selling some nuke parts to I think Iran but don't quote me.  Israel is involved natch.  The vid that brought it home for me was prior to the eq a dog was walking on the beach/animals know when an eq is going to happen and don't just stroll casually down the beach.
               </p>

                Yes on fakebook...for sure.

                Interesting observation/sure/keep ppl diverted.  PG has the potential to expose the satanic worship that has been part of 'history' for millennia.  It's hard to predict how this will all play out and who might be into the SRA that we don't know about yet.  How many SRA peeps are playing the part of good guys exposing the truth/not just gatekeepers and other paid trolls?

                Going a bit OT but Dolores Cannon was very skilled in hypnosis and discovered the 'volunteers' and that earth has had a reset many times/Atlantis being just one example.  She didn't channel, this was all while ppl were deep under.  She was super straight, mainstream looking/not the crystal this and that new agey stuff.  I wonder how many of the volunteers are involved in PG research and other red pilling.  Might want to ck her out/I found it very dot connecting.  I have often thought if it comes to reset Yellowstone would be the perfect vehicle.  Then you mention Yellowstone and fakebook...inquiring minds

                 I very much appreciate the info you've brought forth, and I'll certainly check out the Japan tube earthquake vid, and Dolores Cannon. Good catch with the dog walking down the beach! You're absolutely right about the animals reacting way in advance of earthquakes.

                <p>
                 Considering everything we're currently seeing, it appears that we are already at war, but not in the traditional sense. Those who are awake and researching PG need to also keep researching the other conspiratorial angles because it will provide deeper insight to what is going on as a whole thus enabling us to connect more dots and see the whole picture. Had I not started looking into Blue Beam, I never would've found the story about Monast, and I like how you're taking a different, but similar, angle with Cannon. These freaks we're battling want to control the Earth, so why not also take into account the tech that they have that can create earthquakes and other things that will cause great suffering and stop the revealing of PG? Yellowstone may indeed be the key for them.
                </p>

                 Thanks again for the excellent info, and be safe!

            This is part of the plan. Make good people afraid of having kids, and and make the average person too poor to afford them anyways. I say have your kids where you are from and seriously consider raising them in a place that does not allow such things to happen.

             I agree that it is part of the plan because they want to dictate who has kids and who doesn't, and they probably want to have them grown in labs where the genetic engineering can take place. It would be nice to find somewhere safe from all of this, but where might that place be? We're dealing with globalists who have infiltrated every corner of the Earth and have the capability to kill you no matter where you are. I just don't know where there is any safe harbor from their evil tentacles.

            Does anyone know more about the alleged heart attack gun thing? How close do they have to get? Is it silent? Does it go through walls? Would it affect bystanders or pets?
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT: answers to my own questions, but curious if anyone knows more
           </p>
           <p>
            A CIA secret weapon used for assassination shoots a small poison dart to cause a heart attack, as explained in Congressional testimony in the short video below. The dart from this secret CIA weapon can penetrate clothing and leave nothing but a tiny red dot on the skin. On penetration of the deadly dart, the individual targeted for assassination may feel as if bitten by a mosquito, or they may not feel anything at all. The poisonous dart completely disintegrates upon entering the target.
           </p>
           <p>
            The lethal poison then rapidly enters the bloodstream causing a heart attack. Once the damage is done, the poison denatures quickly, so that an autopsy is very unlikely to detect that the heart attack resulted from anything other than natural causes.

             Not sure if the heart attack gun is the same thing as this or not, but here's a blurb from a very informative webpage about Project Blue Beam:
             <em>
              A 1978 book entitled Microwave
Auditory Effect and Application, by J. C. Lim, explains how audible voice can be
broadcast directly into the brain. This technology could be used to make the
deaf hear, but instead it has been turned against the public. Lim also reports
that he could speed up, slow down, or stop isolated herz by synchronizing the
pulse rate of a microwave beat with the beat of the earth itself. According to
Robert Baker, similar results have been obtained using live frogs, indicating
that it’s technical feasible to produce a heart attack with a ray designed to
penetrate the human chest. I should mention also that Baker does not
participate in such research.

            Poor  Canadians-their  country  is  now  a  Zionist  stronghold where  you can  be arrested  for  speaking  out against Jews, the  Holocaust,  or  pretty  much  anything the  PTB  don't like-oh, how  Canada  has  fallen...

             Canadians look at the filthy, crumbling streets of the  US with it's homeless population, horrendous crime rates and overworked parents (their country has a 1-yr maternity leave) and say - Poor Americans!
            </p>

             Don't feel sorry for the Canadians.  They have it much better than most.

              In  many  ways  your statement is  true, most Americans  I  know have  always  had a  lot  of  love and  respect  for  your beautiful  country, vibrant  social  life,  amazing  music, but  seeing  how the PTB have overtaken you,  leading  you into  the direction of Zionist-Communism  is  heart-rendering,  any society, no  matter  how powerful and creative that  has  been  overtaken  by  this group of political  SUB-HUMANS  is  only a  heartbeat  away  from  poverty, prison, starvation and  gulags-US  included

             Makes you wonder about all the people who said they were going to move there if Trump got elected. Alas, they remained. I suppose they can't have all the crazies crossing the border or their agenda would wain here in the US. I do feel for the Canadians who aren't drinking the Kool-Aid, but where does one go to protect themselves from this insanity?

           <p>
            <em>
             As a result of the sensitive information which he was making known to the public, Serge realized that his life was in danger, had been threatened on many occasions and voiced his opinion that he did not expect to survive.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             It was in fact, a pattern which was timed to each new release of information he publicized that was an ongoing string of tragic events for himself and his family.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             He and his family were faithful believers and they home schooled their children, perhaps knowing all too well the indoctrination facilities that public schools are.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Serge and his 7 year old son were detained by authorities after just such a release of information… allegedly to protect the boy from instability at home.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Serge’s son was placed in foster care and he was released from custody. His daughter was also taken with claims that the children were being abused by not being allowed to attend public school… his children were never returned.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             In the aftermath of his arrest, the following day in his home, December 5th, 1996… Serge Monast suffered a massive coronary which ended his life in his wife’s arms.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             It is easy to see this as an accident and that is precisely how it is meant to seem, but understanding a little bit about what Blue Beam is and what it entails might put that assumption into a different perspective.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Blue Beam technology incorporates transmitters which broadcast at the same frequency as the human body’s nervous system.

           <p>
            <em>
             Along with various other manipulations possible, both mentally and physically, this type of device is able to alter the heart rate of a targeted individual, and it is entirely possible to cause heart attacks with it.

             Is Blue beam different from the heart attack gun? From what I am finding the heart attack gun is a dart of shellfish toxin that causes tingling and then death by paralysis. This is more consistent with his MS diagnosis (probably fake) and alleged treatment, especially if it was administered in small doses at first.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know that Bob Marley suspected that his lethal cancer was administered to his toes by dart placed in a gift of shoes.
