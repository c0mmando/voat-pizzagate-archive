            So what do you think about the hannity interview?  I think Assange may be alive and that they allowed an interview but told him he could not talk about his whereabouts or whether safe etc.  they allowed the interview to quiet the people wondering about his well being??
           </p>
           <p>
            I can't really make sense of the whys but i really think that interview was him (not spliced together)

              Very possible.  I'm just not a big believer in coincidences, especially considering the time line and the pretty obvious message the errors spell out.  They are PRETTY bad spelling errors.  I figure it's better to be safe than sorry when adding them to a public timeline.

            Yeah that's also very strange, the day after Podesta makes a tweet about the food at the embassy Pamela Anderson(wtf?) visits the embassy with a 'vegan' sandwich. It's a sick joke for him, I think they tried to poison him!
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm pretty sure that Julian would only eat with the rest of the personnel at the embassy, so that they would have to poison the entire fucking embassy to get to him.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is probably the reason they stormed it, because he wouldn't eat the "vegan sandwich" which was their last try.

            I think we can basically be certain that Julian is in the hands of the enemies of humanity. Their problem is they know their days are numbered . They also know if it gets nasty the army wont support a load of degenerates. So they have a choice.

            Why would the leaker give the goods only to Assange and nobody else? It seems likely, on the assumption that he is rational, that he would have given it to other sources as a backup, as well as some external storage locations.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Assange was taken, isn't it highly likely that the NSA, FBI, and thereby Trump's team all know about it -- and if so, why haven't they said anything about it? Could they all be under duress too? (Seems doubtful.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Having said that, it is odd that Assange hasn't made a definitive appearance yet to establish he's still alive.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is it possible that he's escaped? What if the white vans etc were a private op run by Xe or some other org, busting him out.
           </p>
           <p>
            This would be consistent with the fact that he has not made an appearance -- he'd have to wait until after the 20th, at the very least.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just thinking aloud.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another consideration: whoever's in charge of the WL twitter, they've been calling out the "Russian hackers" stuff. It seems to be working against the CIA if anything.

             It's absolutely ridiculous to think that anyone other than the US had reason to storm the Ecuadorian embassy, on the same day as Kerry visits them and pressures them to allow capture on Ecuadorian soil.

            <p>
             The 'Russian hackers' is complete bullshit, it wasn't Russians that got Trump elected. It was anons from around the world but the blame goes to Russia, why? Because they are trying to instigate a war between the US and Russia, to kill off as many Europeans and Christians as possible.

            Here is my theory:
Assange and the leaker of podesta emails are the only witnesses of the file transfers.  There is nasty shit hidden via steganography in the emails.  The only way they will be able to convince their followers that Russia put the cp in there is if they are silenced.

             Unless the videos are of specific politicians (for example, Podesta) raping kids. At that point the horror and shock would drown out any concerns about who leaked it.

              That's what I'm screaming.  Who cares who leaked it?!  We already know the emails were not changed - what's in the emails has not been tampered with.

              I think it was Seth Rich.  Watch this interview of Assange - he brings up Seth
