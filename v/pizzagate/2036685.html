            16 is the age of consent in a lot of the world so just another distraction away from what should be the real focus. We should be worrying about the 6 year olds not the 16 year olds.

            Breakfast at Tiffany's had Holly married to a man much older than her when she was 13. Then you have Lolita. There have been tons of films with younger women and older men. Oh, and then another one that is younger men and older women - Y tu mama tambien.

             Males are our sexual abusers of children as even right wing women's groups agree.
            </p>
            <p>
             And they are heterosexual males.  Homosexuals are 100X LESS likely to sexually abuse a child.
Actually, it was tradition in Hawaii before the coming of the "white man" that homosexuals - both
lesbian and gay - were held in honor and esteem for their care of orphaned children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pedophiles are thought to be a case of arrested development and may have no sexual-orientation.
However, heterosexual males who may prefer sexual relations with females will sexually abuse a 
child when no female is available.
If anyone wants more information on the studies, please let me know.

              It has to do with the retention of child like qualities of women that men are attracted to. It's an anthropological trait based on sexual selection. Men are attracted and want to protect women because they are like children. No body hair, more fat, smaller, softer etc.

               Women are not "childlike" ...
              </p>
              <p>
               In fact, it is males who are the more vulnerable gender as more males are lost in spontaneous abortions which nature brings about when there is something wrong with the pregnancy.
              </p>
              <p>
               And more males succumb to illness and death up to the age of two.
Males also die earlier than females.
              </p>
              <p>
               However, you've just given your theory on why males are our sexual abusers of children.
              </p>
              <p>
               Again, if anyone wants more information on the studies which show that it is heterosexual males who re our sexual abusers of children, please let me know.

                Well then I guess anthropologists are all wrong, is saying that the retention of child like qualities as part of sexual selection is totally wrong. Who would you rather fuck, a nubile young thing or Frida Khalo?
               </p>
               <p>
                I am just saying, part of the human brain is hardwired to want to have sex with young fertile women who are not hairy.

                 Immature males may seek women with "childlike" qualities and some women may
adopt "childlike" qualities to attract these immature males ....
                </p>
                <p>
                 We see this in "baby talk" and in females standing with their toes pointed in
to imitate very young girls.
                </p>
                <p>
                 A lot of the clothing that we see being made for adult females today is reminiscent
of clothing made for young girls.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We also often see the return of "slave shoes" for females 
and "choker" necklaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Again, these are things which appeal to immature males and they are "looks"
taught to women to seduce males who are actually attracted to childlike behavior
in females.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Children are NOT "fertile" which is one of the reasons why pedophiles are 
attracted to them.

                  Youthful then. Perhaps "childlike" is not the best term. But women go through puberty around the age of 13-14 making them fertile. So, instead of older women who may have started growing a mustache or having excessive body hair, etc. men are attracted to young nubile women. I mean a horny 15 year old boy is going to want to hump a horny 15 year old girl. Older rich men get the youngest wife that is appropriate.

                   True "childlike" isn't the best term, though men are encouraged to think that women can't 
think for themselves and are childlike.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Also, this Hollywood Model of coupling which depicts females at 20% smaller than males 
is also a lie.
                   <br/>
                   We know that not so long ago men and women stood shoulder to shoulder.
                   <br/>
                   You could as well in recent times see this in the Puerto Rican populations for some reason 
where the females were often larger than the males.*
                   <br/>
                   Some of that has to do with the fact that Nature intends that women carry more fat on their 
bodies which is required for childbearing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Not sure, but I think because of our diets -- specifically animal eating -- females are 
passing through puberty at earlier ages.  And that is being accelerated because of the
hormones and chemicals being used on these animals.
                   <br/>
                   One of the reasons for late terms abortions is cases of incest when even 10 year old 
girls have become pregnant, but certainly we are aware of 11 and 12 year olds who 
are past puberty. 
Puberty alone is not a signal that a female is strong enough to give birth to a child as
what we know of childbearing suggests that it takes an adult female's body seven years
for her body to return to full health and well-being.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Obviously, people can be attracted to the same sex or the opposite sex at very early 
ages.  If you ask people when they were aware of their sexual orientation many will 
state very early ages.
That doesn't mean that they were involved in sexual relationships with the same or 
opposite sex at that time, but we are all capable of feelings of affection and even love 
for one another at any time and we are aware of those attractions and affection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   True -- young teenagers will be attracted to one another -- whether the same sex or 
he opposite.  And they do often become sexually involved at those ages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Many immature older men will seek relationships with younger females, even under 16.
And often pregnancies result and end in abortion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   But what you suggest is "appropriate" in relationships where the older rich men get the 
youngest wife is NOT appropriate.

                    I'm just saying, who doesn't want a young hot wife? No one goes out there and is like "Hey I am looking for a 38 year old fatty with small tits". By and large men are attracted to young women. Neotony exists. Sparse body hair, softer features, women don't have beards, sexual selection and what not.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Why do humans go gaga over things with big eyes and soft faces? Baby seals, baby penguins. Models with big eyes. Why do asians try to make their eyes look bigger to be more kawaii?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Because what we think of as cute, or desirable, is pretty much a woman looking young.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Does that mean I support pedos? Hell no. But you have to be kidding me if you can't at least agree that men are attracted to young women over older women. And that women have more childlike qualities than men.

                     What you are describing are "baby faces" on children which are intended
to make us fall in love with them -- and protect them -- not sexually abuse them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Asians -- who are the majority on the planet -- seemingly came under culture shock after
WWII and the invasion of the US army in Japan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Not so different from women here being encouraged to have plastic surgery --
and breast augmentation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Males in the US are obsessed with women's breasts and many think it is because
of the lack of breast feeding since the late 1930's or so.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I'm sure many women are interested in younger males -- we are seeing those kinds
of marriages more often now as women have more earning power.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     it goes both ways.

                    <p>
                     Women have been trained to be desired --- not to concentrate on what THEY desire.
Times are changing, however.

                    <p>
                     If women want younger more "childlike" males, will the males oblige and develop
more "childlike" qualities?

                      Biologically women want the opposite of child like in their partners. Which is why you see them more attracted to chiseled jaws (no one wants a Hapsburg), deep voices, taller than them, etc. Basically manly protector. No one wants a short fat neck beard and they never will because biologically they are seen as lesser.

                       Again, the "Hollywood" coupling is suggestive of what everyone
                       <strong>
                        should
                       </strong>
                       want and it's long been
propagandized as ... the right thing to want and do.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Women fall in love with men with "baby faces" just as often as men fall in love with women who
are "baby faced."  There's even a song about it.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       While beards on men are being pushed now for decades, from what I see women and girls want
guys without beards, with clean faces -- and nothing to hide behind.
And a shave that produces soft skin -- no razor stubble.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       The idea of a male "protector" exists because females have been so under threat by male
aggression.
I'm sure it would be a relief for males if they didn't think they might have to fight off some male
thugs to protect their girl friend or wife.
I'm talking about the men in our societies which other men fear.

                      <p>
                       From what I've seen and read, women are interested in men who support women and who
are compassionate and humane.

                        I am not going to go into all the research on human biology, nurture nature, facial hair trends (which does not connote baby facial structure), or the desire to retain a mate who is biologically fit and manly to protect not only women but their offspring. But it's a thing. But don't ask me, ask the American Anthropological Association.

                         </strong>
                         surrounding
romance and attractions.  Much of it is created.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Like the role of organized patriarchal religion in mandating a
                         <strong>
                          sexual norm of heterosexuality
                         </strong>
                         ...
because that benefits the church's membership ... whereas homosexuals do not as often procreate.

                         ... they're two different things.
One is about softness which women also appreciate in males -- the other is an insulting portrayal of adult males and females as mentally and spiritually immature.

                         " ... which is that females
have been oppressed by violent males and often subjected to harassment and rape by them.
It is common even today to see gangs of males sexually assaulting women.
This certainly isn't about "sex" as we know it ... it's about domination and control over another human being.
This is also true of male on male rape.

                          I think you are relying on analogies and specific examples, vs. biological evidence over thousands of years. We can always observe a cultural thing, or a trend in a short period of time and chalk that up to biology, or we can observe over a longer period of time, like 50 thousand years, and the actions of evolution, and see a common and traceable trait, regarded as better by sexual selection.

If you want to talk about history over 50 thousand years ago, you are talking about the violent overthrow of 
females and matriarchal-centered societies ...

                          </p>
                          <p>
                           Historically, our professions of influence have been owned and controlled by White Male Patriarchy:
Advertising, Hollywood, Corporations, Organized Patriarchal religions ...
By those males in political control of our nation and its lawmaking over issues such as
birth control and abortion.
We've also seen medicine moved into the hands of males ...
even to the removal of women who studied our plants which are our natural drugs/medicines -
and women who served as midwives where childbirth actually became the business of males/OBGYN's.....!!
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           Who researched, wrote and controlled the "biological evidence over thousands of years" which you refer to

                           Nor has "sexual selection" been the privilege of females -- 
It has been males who have done the selecting which is why US society is so obsessed with female breasts.

                           Further, males patriarchy oppressed females into subservient positions, including into poverty which denied them even inheritance rights from their own families -- and rights to their own children .  They were denied educations and access to professions ... all of  which forced them into marriages in order to have shelter, food, clothing.

                            Btw, we are dealing here with the subject of sexual abuse of children which was covered up by Sigmund Freud in his Oedipus Complex
                           </strong>
                           which outrageously suggested that it was infants, toddlers and very young children who were the sexual aggressors against adult males in their families:-- fathers, grandfathers, uncles, male cousins -- and male friends of the family.
                           <br/>
                           Freud betrayed his young male and female clients who had confided in him their sexual abuse by males in their families and male friends of the family.  The Oedipus Complex was written to HIDE the truth of sexual abuse of children being carried out by males in our societies.

             "Christians" continue to try to demonize homosexuals who are 100X LESS likely to
sexual abuse a child according to studies.  It is heterosexual males who are our 
sexual abusers of children.
            </p>
            <p>
             The nation has learned about this sexual abuse of children because of the courage of 
children who have been abused in coming forward to relate their stories to us.
             <br/>
             Often, they themselves have been demonized for telling these truths.
That's why it is so important to "Listen to the Children."
            </p>
            <p>
             The vileness of "spirit cooking" and the violence involved in "Satanic" abuse and murder of
children goes on because of its violence primarily and the harm done to the minds of its victims.
             <br/>
             It takes children decades to recover from this madness and truly they are permanently injured.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, "Satan" and the "Devil" and "Heaven" and "Hell" are the inventions of male-supremacist
religions which came thousands and thousands of years after the Old World Religions which were
based in Nature and which had no "Satan" and no "Devil."
            </p>
            <p>
             Male-supremacist religions invented these demons in order to control the minds of its members.
That does not mean that "Satanism" isn't a cover story for the true violence and sexual abuse 
and murder which these people themselves perform.
            </p>
            <p>
             Again, it is heterosexual males who are our sexual abusers of children.
If you want more information on those studies, let me know.

               You're just seeped in your religious hatred for homosexuals and can't accept any other reality.

               Pedophilia is about the age of the victim, though there are gender preferences.
              </p>
              <p>
               If a heterosexual male sexually abuses a child, that is "situational" pedophilia.

               Research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are less likely than heterosexual to sexually abuse children.

              <p>
               Perhaps the most egregious and damaging claim promulgated by anti-gay groups is the claim that homosexuality is intrinsically linked to pedophilia and child sexual abuse.  The social science research on sexual orientation and child sexual abuse clearly disproves the claim that homosexuals are more likely to molest children.

               A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.  One researcher explained this statistic by noting, "Gay men desire consensual sexual relations with other adult men.  Pedophiles are usually adult men who are sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children.  They are rarely sexually attracted to other adults.  In fact, research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are LESS likely than heterosexuals to sexually abuse children.  Two studies that examined the sexual orientation of convicted child molesters found that less than 1% in one study and 0% in the other were lesbian or gay.  One psychologist reviewed the existing social science literature on the relationship between sexuality and child sexual abuse and found that "a gay man is no more likely  than a straight man to perpetrate sexual activity with children."  Further, "cases of perpetration of sexual behavior with a pre-pubescent child by an adult lesbian are virtually nonexistent."
              </p>
              <p>
               Gay rights activists, like all advocates for children's welfare, oppose child sexual abuse and support equitable age of consent laws that help prevent and punish such abuse.

               At least 110,000 children are waiting to be adopted in the US.  Approximately 588,00 children are currently in foster care.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
              </p>
              <p>
               Children who remain in foster care for much of their childhood, as do tens of thousands of American children, are more likely to have emotional problems.  Some children in foster care live in 20 or more homes by the time they reach the age of 18.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting is not simply unjust and unethical; it also decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
              </p>
              <p>
               Research shows that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are not disadvantaged vis-a-vis their peers raised by heterosexual parents.

                A review of 352 medical records of children evaluated for sexual abuse during a 12-month period at a Denver children's hospital found that less than 1% had been abused by a gay man or a lesbian.  Of 269 adult perpetrators of child abuse identified among the 352 cases of abuse, only two were  gay or lesbian.  The vast majority of the children in the study (82%) "were suspected of being abused by a man or a woman who was, or had been, in a heterosexual relationship with a relative of the child."  And the review concluded that in this sample, " a child's risk of being molested by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is over 100X greater [than the risk of being molested] by someone who might be identifiable as being homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual."

                   You seem to not get the most important thing about pedophilia or situational pedophilia....
which is AGE.  That's what pedophilia is all about ... AGE.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   There are various terms beyond pedophile which have to do with the AGE of the victim.
Many pedophiles lose interest in a victim once they reach puberty.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Homosexuals do not sexually abuse children.
Homosexuals are interested in adult relationships with other adult homosexuals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Homosexuals are NOT our sexually abusers of children.

There are gender preferences but it is about AGE of the victim.
And, actually, the majority of those sexually abused are female.

                      We can argue till you die of aids, it don't matter to me, ill never believe that straight people who fuck/molest/rape others of the same sex would be considered straight.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Once you fuck/suck/molest someone else of the same sex (male, female, only 2 genders) you cease to be straight.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      And you say a lesbian has NEVER been found to sexually abuse a child? Google lesbian molests kids, and come back here and lie some more.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I dont know why its so hard for you to grasp a simple statement, men who have sexual relations with other males (boys, infants, old people, as long as they are male) are GAY.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      If a male molests a women (child, women, old lady, doesn't matter the age) he ISN'T GAY. Hes just a rapist, molester.

                       Meanwhile, since you mentioned AIDS ... About 30 years ago in Brazil, many heterosexual women were
coming down with HIV/AIDS, though it was very clear that they had only had sex with their own husbands.
And never used drugs.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Eventually -- in this Catholic country --- doctors had to come to realize that about 30% of the
male population was having sex with other men.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       They had no knowledge or evidence of this before the AIDS epidemic.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       But even the DOCTORS didn't realize what was going on.

                      <p>
                       but you should also know that in Latin America -- likely because of the teachings
of the Catholic Church against both birth control/contraceptives AND their teachings
that sex is only for procreation -- anal sex between married couples was often practiced 
in order to avoid pregnancy.

The percentage of MSM involved in risky sex practices differed significantly between years. The proportion was high in 1995 (49.9%), decreasing significantly in 1998 (32.6%), increasing again in 2002 (54.6%), and reaching the lowest level in 2005 (31.4%) (Figure 1).

                        Thus, Brazil had to prioritize more vulnerable population segments like women and children (to prevent vertical transmission). This decline in funding particularly impacted AIDS and STD prevention in the male homosexual and bisexual community, especially from 1998 to 2002. Specifically, the year 2002 showed the highest proportion of risky sexual practices in this community, which had shown decreases in unsafe sex practices until 1998.

             This is BS and propaganda you continue to buy into by the right wing which continues to 
need to sell its propaganda of hatred and intolerance for homosexuals in order to create
the artificial "norm" of heterosexuality.  We haven't even gotten to discussing bi-sexuality
yet.  Bi-sexuality is another issue which has been buried in the effort to create on "norm."
            </p>
            <p>
             These are all the hatreds taught by male-supremacist religions and it's time to stop supporting
them and release yourself from those hatreds.  I'll remind you that those teachings by 
organized patriarchal religions has resulted in thousands of years of violence against 
homosexuals.  And that's what they are intended to do.
            </p>
            <p>
             Stay on the side of the non-violent.
             <br/>
             Violence and force is a clear signal you are on the wrong side.
Pedophilia is based in violence and force.

              Since you are keen to present narcissism as physically measurable, well so is sexuality in the amygdala.  Some animals are gay.

                 the fact that it May (i"m not gonna research it) have been statistically significantly prevalent within one group within ancient greece or even within all of ancient greece  doesn't mean its not always been an abnormality everywhere else for 1000's of years  despite what MTV told you in 1999.  again even if we assume homos were statistically significant in sparta/ancient greece many believe this is what led to its downfall (which if true would circumstantially corroborate that it's abnormal)

                  total bullshit. it's also evident in the animal world. some people are born gay. &amp; what the fuck business is it of yours, anyways? you don't need to be thinking about what other adults are doing in their lives and bedrooms. none of your business. period.

                   It can possibly be a genetics thing ( definitely not 100% genetics in all cases),, i dont wanna criminalize or persecute those that are gay/consider themselves so.  i dont think it should be pushed as a lifestyle choice to the young n confused.   pushing it like that and widespread numbers do have, at a minimum, tangential effects upon society.

                    good, i hope they all turn gay. the world would be a much kinder place! then the pressing issue of the day would be whether our shoes are sparkley enough!

                    edit: why are the young necessarily confused?? who said that? they are not. the adults, i think, are the confused ones, because society guilt trips them to that point!

I think you will find that would be culturally relative.

                    I am referring to the tribalistic practice of binding ones penis and inserting it within ones own body.  Real cultural practice, I am sure it doesn't make sense to us because we are culturally brainwashed, all of us.  This is truly what  Huxley meant by transcending nationalism and tribalism and connecting to one another in the glory of truth.  A one world government, technocratic society.
