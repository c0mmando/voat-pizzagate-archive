This occurred in 2010-12, was known by Connecticut Public Health in 2012. Fox surrendered his license (thttps://www.elicense.ct.gov/Lookup/LicenseLookup.aspx) then fled to New Zealand where he was able to continue working.https://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Adam-Lanza-s-psychiatrist-pleads-guilty-to-sex-13913370.php</p>
<p>Fox prescribed drug cocktail to female victim who complained of being drugged.</p>
<p>According to the investigative file, over the course of one year, Fox prescribed what the victim called a “dynamic cocktail of psychiatric drugs.” The “constantly changing mix” of psychiatric drugs included: Ativan (anxiety), Saphris (bi-polar disorder), Abilify (schizophrenia), Nuvigil (sleep apnea, narcolepsy), Prozac (Major-depression, OCD), Zyprexa (Schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder), Xanax, and Vistaril (anxiety, tension). Vistaril also is used as a sedative and for general anesthesia.&quot;
&quot;And one simply cannot ignore what appears to be another questionable patient “treatment” problem which has arisen in New Zealand, where Fox fled to practice psychiatric counseling. Fox reportedly “treated” Nicky Stevens, a young man who died while under psychiatric care in New Zealand&quot;.http://ablechild.org/tag/dr-paul-fox/

<p>&quot;in 2013, it was reported that psychiatrist Paul Fox, who had been de-registered in the USA for sexual misconduct, and was the former clinician for the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass murderer Adam Lanza was employed by the DHB. Fox was de-registered in NZ by the Medical Council in February 2014.&quot;https://kate-raue.blogspot.com/2015/09/henry-rongomau-bennett-centre-lunatics.html</p>
<p>Fox told detectives in a Dec. 17, 2012, telephone interview that he had destroyed any records he had of his treatment of Lanza but recalled last seeing him when Lanza was about 15.https://www.psychsearch.net/paul-fox/</p>

<p>No idea what a Connecticut psychiatrist is doing affiliated with a Medical Group in Beverly Hills. Their medical director Barry Friedman is deceased.

<p>Here\'s some &quot;satisfied&quot; past customer\'s remarks on Dr. Friedman: &quot; His bedside manner is horrible- he barely talks to you or even looks at you and is constantly looking things up on his computer because he doesn\'t remember. You have to remind him about your reason for being there. He basically just writes you whatever prescription and could care less about you and your health&quot;https://www.vitals.com/doctors/Dr_Barry_D_Friedman.html</p>

<p>&quot;First of all, I would like to second what Johnathan B. has said about Dr. Friedman\'s handing out of pills like candy while rushing you quickly out the door.&quot;

            Whether Adam L really existed or not or  whether he was a product of MKU (I believe whoever he was that he was MKU).  The important thing here too is how this Freak of a Dr. was not discovered much sooner.  Now he has run off to do more damage in NZ.  Land of milk and hone for pedos.  He must be stopped and brought back to suffer the consequence and horrible crimes.  This is what they do.  They plunder and damage our Children and then on to the next place where usually they can get away with even more.

             And why he's affiliated with a Beverly Hills outfit? Sounds like their director per the Yelp reviews was another drug cocktail pusher.

              Yeah and Beverly Hills is well protected by the LAPD.  Surely they were looking the other way which of course aided him in his disgusting crimes.  These perverts love to drug teens.  Even Little Children.

              Here is the video of officers putting a bag in a pickup before driving off. Notice how the weapon systems on their slings are compact and short in length. Obviously not an AR platform gun, speculation of a Tavor fits the footage. Anyway, thats almost unimportant to the fact officers are presumably removing evidence from the scene.

              Here is Stoneman Douglas teacher Stacey Lippel describing the shooter(s) as having gear akin to riot police. Also describes the gun as something unseen before by her. (Not AR15). Supports IWI Tavor theory. Non-standard issue weapon. Used by Israeli special forces.

              I will try to get back to this later today. I found likely connections between the SWAT units that were on scene, but were unauthorized and without disptach. Then you've got the teacher that described the shooters as heavily armored men with 'rifles that she'd never seen before' (Not AR15s) then the security cam footage of dudes exiting the school and loading into a pickup truck. They appear to be carrying bullpup configuration rifles like an Israeli Tavor. Its hard to be sure, but its clearly not a typical AR platform gun.

               Here is the video of officers putting a bag in a pickup before driving off. Notice how the weapon systems on their slings are compact and short in length. Obviously not an AR platform gun, speculation of a Tavor fits the footage. Anyway, thats almost unimportant to the fact officers are presumably removing evidence from the scene.
