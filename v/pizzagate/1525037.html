            It doesn't matter, everyones hands are tied, if they had any power they were already using it. Now we just wait to see what trump does, then turn up the heat.

            There will be evidence of guilt still. They will forget something. At the very least it will have stopped happening. Which honestly is the only thing that really matters.

            This is purely about health stuff, nothing pizza related :P
           </p>
           <p>
            The Alzheimers part really hits home as its running in my family and i can see the ravages first hand. Ill never stop smoking, just for this reason. Also for those not aware (majority of people) we get closer and closer to understanding this disease and part of that understanding brought new ways to fight the sickness before it even starts. The main cause of Alzheimer is the accumulation of dead cells in a certain part of the brain. We didnt know until recently that the way our body usually get rid of that stuff is through SLEEP. During a specific phase of sleep, the brain will shrink the neurons up to 60% of their size so that the garbage around them (dead cells) gets collected and pushed through the brain barrier to be then filtered by the body.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you have Alzheimer in your family ask yourself if these people had sleep issues during their lives prior to the disease (the case in my family). If they did, it might very well be preventable. If you have sleep problem, it usually comes from a lack of melatonin, either by too much light (melatonin gets created when in darkness) or because of certain deficiency.
           </p>
           <p>
            The main ''ingredient'' to produce melatonin is Mg, magnesium. Magnesium is great stuff, really important for the body. Unfortunately, no one talks about it and up to 60-70% of people in the US are magnesium deficient. Worse, the Mg to Calcium ratio is completely out of balance since we started telling families that milk is good for the bones yada yada. Sure, calcium is good, but we need really little and we get so many from just a glass of milk. Problem is, to absorb that calcium you need the magnesium. What happens when you get just the calcium? It get stored. Everywhere. Arteries, scalp, little hard bumps here and there on your body, not good at all, and then you need to add to that all the psychological effects, like the lack of good sleep patterns (which can turn into Alzheimer over time...)
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the list of symptoms from Mg deficiency:
           </p>
           <p>
            hyperexcitability, muscular symptoms (cramps, tremor, fasciculations, spasms, tetany, weakness), fatigue, loss of appetite, apathy, confusion, insomnia, irritability, poor memory, and reduced ability to learn. Moderate to severe magnesium deficiency can cause tingling or numbness, heart changes, rapid heartbeat, continued muscle contractions, nausea, vomiting, personality changes, delirium, hallucinations, low calcium levels, low serum potassium levels, retention of sodium, low circulating levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH),[4] and potentially death from heart failure.[5] Magnesium plays an important role in carbohydrate metabolism and its deficiency may worsen insulin resistance, a condition that often precedes diabetes, or may be a consequence of insulin resistance.[6][7]
           </p>
           <p>
            Even for stress it's really important as it comes to dial down your Adrenalin.
           </p>
           <p>
            TL;DR So to sumarize. An Mg deficiency will cause a lack of sleep due to the difficulty to produce melatonin in good enough quantities, which in turn makes your brain less able to ''garbage collect'' during the night, which in turns can make you alzheimer over the years (for certain people) plus multitude other problems. Yet we still don't give a shit about it. I need to add here that I'm still confused about weed for this because i know for a fact that it affects sleep, so is it good? bad? it seems bad because you dream way less. Either way, you need Mg and you very probably don't have enough unless you eat one cup of sunflower seeds a day or like 8 potatoes.
           </p>
           <p>
            So if you've made it this far i hope you'll make your research for your own health and find solutions that are maybe a bit outside the beaten path because the beaten path was made by the same people pizzagate is fighting against. Just ask yourself why the fuck Kellogs got to decide for the whole country what kind of food we're supposed to eat for breakfast. Do you feel weird eating you last dinner for breakfast. It used to be like this until Kellogg told us we need milk and cereals for breakfast. It's so easy to manipulate the masses.

            I didnt believe you even as a smoker (as i read studies of cannabis causing problem in brain development of children) but holy shit a lot of recent studies proves that yes, cannabis derivatives do increase neurogenesis in the brain,

            But I personally think PG will need a snitch and I can't think of any better than Charlie Sheen.... if he came out now and admitted what he did to Corey but followed with what happened to him as a kid and started naming names he'd probably be given a pass from the gallows.
           </p>
           <p>
            That would certainly be a good reason for Martin Sheen to appear in a video that was trying to force an electoral coup. IMHO of course

            Obama only has the power to pardon federal crimes, right?  State crimes are beyond his reach.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, can a pardon precede a conviction?  If not, there's no reason to wait to start the process.  It will take a lot longer than 3 weeks to reach any convictions.

             I'm sure he just watched it and decided it wasn't up to his quality or rethought differen't ways to say the same thing. I wouldn't be surprised if he remakes somehow.

             He has to be careful with what he says, putting 'allegedly' and 'suspected' in there every time and such..

             Well, he kept making actual accusations that could potentially get him sued, and he had just gone for a run so he sounded out of breath. It says the video was removed by the user.

             I came here to say exactly this. It showed up in the YouTube search for David's Seaman but then disappeared less than 4 hours later. I can't substantiate it yet but given how nutty things are becoming I suspect him deleting that video may be due to the same reason that Milo Yiannopolous stopped from giving a talk on PizzaGate due to "several phone calls from DC area codes" and also why InfoWars has taken down some of the stuff regarding PizzaGate from their website. I think that Trump has been fully aware of this along with Steve Bannon and General Flynn as well as others and that they absolutely need to wait until January 20, 2017 which is only 3 weeks away. They need to get in, finish the appointments of their people of which there are upwards of 3,000+, sign several dozen executive orders undoing all the shit Obama has been up to, and start to DRAIN THE SWAMP.
            </p>
            <p>
             Uncovering a "normal" mafia type ring that runs drugs or guns or whatever is already the sort of thing that takes law enforcement dozens or hundreds of agents months to years to build cases on.
            </p>
            <p>
             In this case it's something far more sinister and many of the people involved are in high levels of power and position within the government itself which means that come January 20, Trump is going to have to start draining the swamp very quickly to ensure that whatever power structure the globalists or whomever is behind all this doesn't have time to properly and coherently react.
            </p>
            <p>
             Granted a good portion of my belief here is based on hope but I'm also putting myself in the shoes of someone like Alex Jones or Steve Bannon or Trump himself and I sure as shit would be playing my cards close to the best until I was absolutely in office and the previous regime couldn't touch me.

            David Seaman needs a vacation because clearly the stress over this story and losing his job at HuffPost, coupled with all the crap he has to take from people online, is getting to him.  I say this objectively, as a person who believes that the things y'all are exposing are real.  David Seaman sounds like a petulant whiner in these videos and having him as a spokesman detracts.  He seems unstable.  He seems paranoid.  He's a pot advocate, so maybe that's part of the problem since pot does, after all, modify people's minds.  All I'm saying is this whiny demand for Trump to take action when he's not even been inaugurated does nothing but point out to all of us that David Seaman is incompetent.  It ain't time, buddy.  Put down the bong and go to study the Constitution at the library.  Trump won't be President until he's inaugurated.  Geez.

            Pedophilia in Hollywood is as rampant as it is in Washington and they all see Trump as a threat. Shining light on one part of the problem is bad for all of them. And some abuse networks might even be connected in unexpected ways.

            a Trump supporter if he prosecutes. Him saying things like, "I don't want to hurt the Clintons" and "Carlos Slim is a wonderful man" make me nervous.  I also worry that there will be a few symbolic prosecutions but the whole system will not be brought down, most people will go back to sleep, and it will continue to fester.
            <br/>
            I disagree with so many of his viewpoints and proposed policies, but if he got the ball rolling for us combat the deep corruption that is really the heart of all our problems, none of that would hardly matter.
            <br/>
            Either way, I see his presidency as a catalyst. If he won't do something, we will. I never would've voted for him but wish him the best and hope he stays safe.

             I cant support anyone that supports israel so now I cant support trump. The one good thing obama did was let the vote go through.
zionism is rotting the world from the inside out like a cancer. If he wants to drain the swamp he needs to start there and he wont. Therefore he had no intention and is simply one more cog in the wheel. I highly doubt now he will do anything other than play ball like all other presidents do.

            Congress still must confirm. 
I've been telling people this for awhile...
OBAMA WANTS TRUMP TO TALK ABOUT PIZZA GATE. 
He is baiting him into confirming to the public that relies on "Fake News" on the internet and propaganda from the Russians, instead of CIA intelligence. And because of this new preposterous information, he is no longer qualified to serve as president and congress must reject.
Best thing Trump can do is lay low and be patient until Jan 20th. 
But DAY ONE, go for the jugular. Arrest them all. Send Obama to The Hague.

            I wholeheartedly agree with putting public pressure on the administration, that's not what I'm saying. What I mean is, don't everyone freak out when the Clintons and pals aren't being perp-walked on the 21st.

            On Jan 20th though, this definitely will not change things right away. There are many things to investigate and hopefully we won't be spending time dealing with the total diplomatic chaos from what Obama is setting up right now. Just a warning in case people grow impatient.

            I also fully expect the outing of Ryan, McConnell, McCain and Grahamesty. I have always know McCain McConnell and Graham were dirty, but Ryan put a gigantic target on his back with his behavior. And all of their continued behavior with Russia. I can't say whether Ryan is actually dirty or blackmailed, but I'd lean towards dirty and profiting off of things that are illegal like the rest of them.

            I wouldn't underestimate how intelligent this man is. He proved himself to be a fox in the hen house all through the primaries and general campaigns. What I know about Trump is that he was willing to take a very unfavorable risk by going after BHO's birth certificate. He didn't do that all on his own. He has great sources and knew it was a fraud. What I took from that entire thing is that, along with his observations on the day of 9/11, he's like a lot of us who are questioning things and then looking into them. He just has much better resources to be able to find out the actual facts. And that is actually why I think they fear him. They (MSM) may have propped him up during the primaries bc they were so convinced that he had no way of winning and then freaked when they saw he actually could win.

            I am pretty sure "they" will try to assassinate Trump, and maybe David too.
           </p>
           <p>
            edit: Also I find David appears to be depressed or something else, he looks and behaves different than in previous videos....

            edit2: comment under the video from David: 
"for those asking- I'm fine. I find myself out of breath lately a lot, even though I was just walking back from lunch. I don't think they can silence us. I think John Podesta is a disgusting failure, a disgrace to the species. Being out of breath won't change my view on that﻿"

            Trump is going to be very busy putting out fires from Obama's scorched earth policies as he leaves office.  Don'the expect movement on pizzagate unless it is a slam dunk.

             I remember well the great anticipation when Bush Jr. got elected; all my GOP friends were rubbing their hands together anticipating the Clintons finally getting prosecuted for some of their many crimes.  Then the first thing Bush Jr. says once he's sworn in is NOPE; it's time to move on.
            </p>
            <p>
             They were all disappointed (but kept on believing in Bush and supporting him anyway).  I wasn't, because I had kept my expectations low.  I'm doing the same thing now.

I wouldn't doubt he may be getting death threats. ☹ I'm praying for his safety. We all need to keep a close eye on him and support him. He's pretty hated.

             A couple notes on that moment.. I took special pleasure in seeing Hillary change her fake smile into the death stare when he said that. I also took note of the fact other people knew it was a little too close to truth by their shocked reaction. Kind of like "these are things we do NOT mention in public". Pretty much as if he went up and made a joke about the Pope liking little boys.

               I have no proof of that but I 100% believe he is. Men aren't meant to be celibate. It's a stupid requirement made up by humans, not God. Like every other stupid requirement in the Catholic Church. 
Here's your proof he's a POS:

             the fact that the msm and so many hellywood actors hate him so much gives me hope. makes it look like they're freaking out b/c they're about to be exposed.

            I agree with David Seaman's new video.  A lot of us have put faith in trump as the anti-establishment, anti-globalist figure who will drain the swamp and return the United States back to the people.  However, if he doesn't act on the mountain of evidence and coincidences surrounding #Pizzagate I will lose trust in him as legitimate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, he notes that a Washington insider has confirmed to him that Pizzagate is indeed real.  I wonder if we reach out to David in enough force he will reveal his sources.

             Yet, he is hiring all globalists and elites for his cabinet, and you folks are like 'hey that's fine, these are smart people who made a lot of money'. The cognitive dissonance here is so loud I can't hear myself read.

              I like Flynn - He has posted about #SpiritCooking and Pizzagate.  His son has as well.  I like Bannon as he worked hand-in-hand with Breitbart who very much knew and died for what he knew.  I also am optimistic about Tillerson as he's pro-Russia.  I don't agree with some of his other picks though.

              Trump KNOWS. In a recent GWebb video, he said he saw Trump at some of the "parties" (for foreign diplomats in NY). He said Trump would only be there for a couple of minutes, then leave early. Afterwards was when the pizza party really started.

             He seemed a little wasted in this one. It goes off into the weeds a little, bringing up god and pot and conspiracy people distancing themselves from him... He's gotta hold it together and stay on the evidence, not give the media rambling off topic rants to use against him.

             That is a good message to give the new administration though, especially Sessions. It just should be simpler and focused on prosecuting Hillary and investigating Podesta's human trafficking evidence.

              Sessions whole reputation, decades in the making, rests on how he handles this. He and Trump are gonna prosecute it. No doubt.

              I feel like this was just him getting heated at the lack of direct acknowledgement of this whole thing from Trump when it's obvious enough to have spread as far as it has. It's being right and feeling a lack of proof; even those of the most stalwart fortitude are subject to frustrations.
