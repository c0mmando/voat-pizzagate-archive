            That's how Christine LeGarde got her job.  Dominique was ostracized for consorting with myriads of women and possible prostitutes.  This could be connected to the sex trafficking of his friend Pinchuk. Possible.

             Pinchuk has also partied with an IMF member at his private yacht.  I think he is a provider.

              Would not be surprised.  Lately it seems there is one around every other corner.  I know it is not, but it seems like an epidemic.
