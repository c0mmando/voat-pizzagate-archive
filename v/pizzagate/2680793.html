<p>Asia Argento, Who Accused Weinstein, Made Deal With Her Own Accuser</p>
<p>The Italian actress and director Asia Argento was among the first women in the movie business to publicly accuse the producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault. She became a leading figure in the #MeToo movement. Her boyfriend, the culinary television star Anthony Bourdain, eagerly joined the fight.</p>
<p>But in the months that followed her revelations about Mr. Weinstein last October, Ms. Argento quietly arranged to pay $380,000 to her own accuser: Jimmy Bennett, a young actor and rock musician who said she had sexually assaulted him in a California hotel room years earlier, when he was only two months past his 17th birthday. She was 37. The age of consent in California is 18.</p>
<p>That claim and the subsequent arrangement for payments are laid out in documents between lawyers for Ms. Argento and Mr. Bennett, a former child actor who once played her son in a movie.</p>
<p>The documents, which were sent to The New York Times through encrypted email by an unidentified party, include a selfie dated May 9, 2013, of the two lying in bed. As part of the agreement, Mr. Bennett, who is now 22, gave the photograph and its copyright to Ms. Argento, now 42. Three people familiar with the case said the documents were authentic.</p>
<p>Mr. Bennett, who lives in Los Angeles, would not agree to be interviewed, said his lawyer, Gordon K. Sattro. “In the coming days,” Mr. Sattro wrote in an email, “Jimmy will continue doing what he has been doing over the past months and years, focusing on his music.”</p>
<p>In an April letter addressed to Ms. Argento confirming the final details of the deal and setting out a schedule of payments, Ms. Goldberg characterized the money as “helping Mr. Bennett.”</p>
<p>“We hope nothing like this ever happens to you again,” Ms. Goldberg wrote. “You are a powerful and inspiring creator and it is a miserable condition of life that you live among shitty individuals who’ve preyed on both your strengths and your weaknesses.”</p>
<p>But for Mr. Bennett, who as a child actor charmed Harrison Ford and Bruce Willis and earned the nickname Jimmy Two-Takes because he rarely flubbed his lines, the 2013 hotel-room encounter was a betrayal that precipitated a spiral of emotional problems, according to the documents.</p>
<p>The fallout from “a sexual battery” was so traumatic that it hindered Mr. Bennett’s work and income and threatened his mental health, according to a notice of intent to sue that his lawyer sent in November to Richard Hofstetter, Mr. Bourdain’s longtime lawyer, who was also representing Ms. Argento at the time.</p>
<p>Ms. Argento, who lives in Rome, subsequently turned to Ms. Goldberg — a prominent lawyer for victims of online attacks — to handle the case. (Mr. Hofstetter is now handling the estate of Mr. Bourdain, who killed himself in June. Although Mr. Bourdain helped Ms. Argento navigate the matter, neither Mr. Hofstetter nor Kimberly Witherspoon, Mr. Bourdain’s longtime agent and now a spokeswoman for his wife, Ottavia Busia, from whom he was separated, would comment for this article.)</p>
<p>Mr. Bennett’s notice of intent asked for $3.5 million in damages for the intentional infliction of emotional distress, lost wages, assault and battery. Mr. Bennett made more than $2.7 million in the five years before the 2013 meeting with Ms. Argento, but his income has since dropped to an average of $60,000 a year, which he attributes to the trauma that followed the sexual encounter with Ms. Argento, his lawyer wrote.</p>
<p>In October, a month before Mr. Bennett sent his demand for money, The New Yorker published an article by Ronan Farrow that included Ms. Argento among 13 women who accused Mr. Weinstein of harassment and rape.</p>
<p>I will let you read the rest.  You know the story.  She claims she was raped by Weinstein, well be that as it may, I guess she thinks it\'s OK for her to do it to a minor.  This is beyond disgusting. </p>

           Asia Argento, Who Accused Weinstein, Made Deal With Her Own Accuser
          </p>

            KEY DETAIL Mr. Bennett was 7 when he was cast in “The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things,” a 2004 film Ms. Argento directed, starred in and helped write. The script, based on a book by the pseudonymous writer JT LeRoy, depicts the grim relationship between a drug-addicted prostitute played by Ms. Argento and her son, played by Mr. Bennett and two other young actors. Ms. Argento’s character dresses her son as a girl to lure men, and the boy is ultimately raped.

             I Totally Agree.  We cut the cord last year.  As long as we keep lining their pockets by watching their filthy programming, they will not take notice.  We saw how little Kevin Spacey's new movie grossed in three days.  $287.  CUT THE CORD.

              Good job. People dont realize how powerful a protest that is! Even ONE household canceling is a BIG DEAL. It might be the most powerful protest possible. $100-200 A MONTH FOR LIFE, is what these Satanic scum expect to leech out of the population. People PAY FOR THEIR OWN BRAINWASHING AND DEGREDATION. The cabal freaks out when anyone cancels canle cuz they know you are never coming back! No one goes back once they are free from that chain. Life improves. You literally get smarter, more aware. Its probably the scariest thing you can do to the satanic canal is cancel cable. You automaticlly start to de brainwash. Even if you think you are "woke" but still watching cable YOU'RE NOT. Its that powerful. You WILL be influenced. You will be weaker. $100-200 a month for life!? Are you kidding me? Wow, what an amazing scam. Thats a new car payment. A decent retirement savings. Cable is  suicide

            Asia Argento co-wrote and directed the movie called The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things, the movie Jimmy was in when he was a boy.  The boy Jeremiah gets raped by a character played by Jeremy Renner.  Later, a slightly older (but still a child) Jimmy is played by Cole/Dylan Sprouse.  She forces him to crossdress, and he seduces a character played by Marilyn Manson.  Not making this shit up.  Here is the wiki:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Sarah (Asia Argento) becomes involved with a series of men who treat her and Jeremiah (Jimmy Bennett) poorly, and she uses them as an excuse to abandon her son. She disappears to Atlantic City with her boyfriend, Emerson (Jeremy Renner), and then abandons him; Emerson returns to their home and rapes Jeremiah. After a trip to hospital, Jeremiah's grandmother (Ornella Muti) takes him to a West Virginian radical Christian cult led by his grandfather (Peter Fonda). After he has been three years with the cult, Sarah returns to reclaim the 11-year-old Jeremiah (Dylan and Cole Sprouse).

            Sarah's current lover, Kenny (Matt Schulze), a truck driver, eventually abandons them at a truck stop while Sarah is soliciting. Sarah realizes that if she is going to keep her men she cannot say Jeremiah is her son. She persuades Jeremiah to cross dress so he can act as her "little sister", and Jeremiah's cross-dressing evolves to include his mother's seduction techniques. After dressing up as a "baby doll" version of Sarah which consisted of her makeup, her white nightgown and her red high heel pumps, Jeremiah (although the audience sees Asia Argento as Jeremiah because this scene could not be done with child actors as it was too inappropriate) seduces Jackson (Marilyn Manson), his mother's latest man, who initially tries to rebuff the boy's advances, but then gives in. Sarah is furious with Jackson for giving in to the boy's advances and with Jeremiah for ruining her panties with drops of blood on them, and she takes Jeremiah and leaves.
           </p>
           <p>
            Later, they are in a house where the basement houses a methamphetamine laboratory, which later blows up with Sarah's latest boyfriend inside. After fleeing, and while detoxing from methamphetamine, Sarah is convinced that everyone is after them and that only certain foods are edible (mainly chips and soda). She convinces Jeremiah that if they eat anything but those foods, they will be poisoned which leads them to a failed attempt to shoplift at a grocery store; afterwards, Jeremiah finds a hamburger to eat from a dumpster. His mother, in a state of "meth psychosis", is convinced the food he ate was poison, and makes him drink ipecac in order to make him better and rid him of any "poisons".
           </p>
           <p>
            Jeremiah wakes up in the hospital with his grandmother beside him. She tells him that Sarah is in the psychiatric ward. Later that night, Sarah collects Jeremiah from his hospital room, and, rather than have him go back to the cult, she clutches his hand and they walk away in hospital gowns. The final scene is of Sarah and Jeremiah driving away."
           </p>
           <p>
            She wrote, on purpose, a story about a little boy who is neglected, raped, abused, and forced to become a cross-dressing child prostitute.  Think about all the time, people, effort and money it took to make her idea a reality.

             Wow.  That is really sick.  Why people even go to see stuff like this is beyond me.  It seems she created this whole thing then because it was A Fantasy of Hers. If this is what she Dreamed Of, then she needs Serious Psychiatric Help.  This is probably a product of HER upbringing.  You have to wonder what kind of life someone has to come up with stuff like that. Yikes. I will let people look up the photos.  We get enough NSFW as it is that we can't unsee.  Ugh, I don't even want to imagine them.

            Great post.
           </p>
           <p>
            To me it solidifies the claim that the new satanists and old guard satanic elite pedophiles are having a turf war and that the new satanists are renegotiating their contracts. It's hard because everybody has something on everyone else because they're all scummy dirty evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            So Asia Argento and Anthony Bourdain were working on the same side that Rose McGowan is. Why anyone believes McGowan is anything more than part of the problem is beyond me. They're all in this new satanist uprising movement. They don't like the rules, want more power, and to unseat some of the people giving them problems if they can. Hence, an old sadistic fool like Weinstein gets targeted and they speak out against him when there's DG and SS and RR and you don't hear a peep out of them about those alleged pedos.
           </p>
           <p>
            I just keep hoping everything is revealed so they can all get sent to Gitmo and we don't have to hear anything more about these PedoWood Elites -- or read their stupid tweets and propaganda in the fake news outlets.

             That is really some interesting stuff.  I have never heard of a War Between Satanists, but it sure sounds highly possible.  We have been wondering why they threw HW under the bus.  Hmm.Yes, you are right no one seems to be coming to their aid either.  Well, the Biggest Satanists of all DG SS and RR are as quiet as Church Mice.  They are watching all this like it was a movie.  I so want it to have a Bad Ending.

              Bad for them, anyway. Great for us! It's where they all go to jail and are exposed for the scum they are.

              It's excruciatingly slow waiting for the facade to crumble. But the two factions having a war explains this. If it were only the old guard pedo elite, the people opposing them would squeal but not when they're part of the infrastructure. People like Bourdain, McGowan, Argento have done too many favors and helped build the elite to what they are today. Who knows what got Bourdain knocked off the playing field. Maybe he was a little too abrasive. I mean, you can fight for your rights, but you can't actually call HRC out as scum. Nobody gets away with that.

               That could possibly be it .  Yes, well, it seems like the Old Guard is bumping the New Guard off quite often.  Some are dead wood to them for sure, but others have to go because they were ready to squeal or got greedy thinking they were more important than they really were.  What do you think the score is?

                Oh, the Old Guard is way in the lead. They probably upped the perks a bit. Maybe money via a lucrative deal/movie role. Then there's money exchanged from the sale of a house, etc. And Katy Perry was given the cushy American Idol judge role. Supposed to give her money and credibility, but all she did is appear like a wasted skank who has had WAY too many cosmetic procedures and injections of adrenochrome.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Old Guard has way too much money and resources, but the new satanists have a point. It's because of them that PedoWood remains popular. And forget about all the scummy things they got themselves involved with. They were the army that the Old Guard used to dispense, control, and abuse. I would imagine they're pretty adept at rounding up and terrorizing children by now, but they'll get a pound of flesh for their trouble.

                    It's a shame that people have to waste their breath explaining things to those who refuse to listen. It's why there has to be something huge that happens. Otherwise, there will be lingering doubt that this is real ... which it is.

                     Idk, it's being stubborn.  I think it is partly that most people like to find things like that themselves.  It's like admitting someone might be smarter than they are, which is silly.  When people tell me things now, I don't blow it off, I look into it.  Then I decide.  If people only took that one step..............just looking.

                      Yup, I've blown people off and been so wrong. I get it years later, but can't tell them that they were right and I was a jerk for not taking the step you describe.

                      Absolutely take a peek ... take the step. Especially when children's lives are at stake. I still can't imagine the terror they must feel. Just looking at the images, those poor little kids. They must be absolutely panicked, but have nowhere to go because no one believes little kids. Not even when they have VD.

             Great find. She is a mixed bag for sure.  I suspect that that she and Rose McGowan were beginning to age out in the movie industry while never achieving the stardom they hoped would come their way via the casting couch and which would carry them thru middle age and senior roles that Meryl Streep enjoys.  Hence they turned on Weinstein as the originator of their mediocrity.  Not that he deserves any sympathy.

             And there exists a horrible picture of him holding up a blood drenched heart which looks human but was probably a pigs heart.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bourdain was very critical of vegetarians and apparently held little respect for the animals sacrificed for our consumption.  The disregard for animals in the food industry from farm to market is what turned me into a vegetarian. Off topic, sorrry.

              He holds up a pigs heart, I agree that may be a way to express his feelings about the treatment of animals, but there are so many other things on that instagram, that are questionable.  Not everyone that stands up for animals uses gory examples.  There is much to be questioned about his background.  We had many many posts on here regarding his macabre views, like blood soaked outfits.  Many restaurant people have instagrams without posting those kind of pics.   I too have cut back my eating of meat and agree with his feelings about animals.

            Hollyweird kids are never able to have a normal life. By reading some of the comments on DL sounds like his parents tried to screw him over financially too. This is just creepy considering he played her son at age 7 in a movie. Some said he went along with it. Even if he did and sued for the money, he's just doing what they taught him to do. Manipulate.

             He also had contact with Harrison Ford, Bruce Willis and Eddie Murphy.  We know the story about Willis Moore and Kutcher.  Another sad story.  Yes, put in a movie at 6 yrs. old by parents.

              I know, it's sad they do this to their kids. Those tweets between the two, even with his deleted were gross. Her calling him her boy, baby. Then 9 years later after the movie she had sex with him. No wonder their brains get so screwed up.

               Her father Dario Argento is a director of Italian Horror Films.  That should tell us something.  It probably started early with her.  Passed from one to another. And her talking how they were mother and son.  Her brain actually believed this.

                 Funny how you just pick up that stuff after being here so long and every day almost.  It's sad we have to come up with this stuff. But it fits the narrative.  It needs to stop.   So many have been sold of by Greedy Evil Parents.

             Thank You for recognizing that.  This is how it continues and is passed on over and over.  She committed a horrid act of rape, but along with that comes possibly another rape from a newly created pedo.  He seems to have been deserted by his parents who put him in a movie at the age of 6.  He charmed Harrison Ford and Bruce Willis and was also in a movie with Eddie Murphy.  I have a feeling the damage started long before Argento.

              Oh gosh, yes, I bet you're right. Seriously, are there any successful actors that start young that aren't groomed &amp; abused?!? I keep remembering Renegade's posts about Hollywood; everything he said made sense.

               Yes, thanks for reminding about Renegade.  How true.  Someone said he was someone from Sanford  Son maybe.  I think he was right on.  I also have read that Quincey Jones had his way with MJ many times.  Joe Jackson was an Evil Man.

                I reread his posts &amp; kept coming back to him being Martin Lawrence. He was a comedian, like his friend Redd Fox, who was on Sanford &amp; Son. He also made a statement regarding living on his ranch, &amp; my husband came across an article that mentioned Martin Lawrence having a ranch for sale. Dave Chappelle once gave  interview of Hollywood  ruining the life of his friend, Martin Lawrence. Whoever it is, he came across as pretty credible.

                 Yes, someone else mentioned it too on here.  There are so many that have been abused or know about it.  Imagine knowing and not being able to come forward.  The would kill you.  Frightening.

            This poor kid has been screwed over multiple times by everyone in his life. His parents skimmed money out of his trust fund, they put him in a movie when he was 6 where he played a child of a prostitute who put him in situations where he ended up being raped (by the now exposed as fake JT Leroy) and his parents have now kicked him out of the family home that his earnings probably bought? Damn.

              I propose that anything she has ever written and acted in is tainted because of her past.  This stuff is not borderline.  It is very sick. People don't just wake up one morning and start being this way.  Something had to have happened to her as well.  We know and have had articles here about how it runs in the family, somehow.  And the cross dressing part, etc. I can't even.

            If you read the story, they had a mother/son relationship since he was 7. The actual details are very creepy.

            He was barely 17, . A few days before she raped him, he was a 16 year old boy.

             Yea he called her mom. They roleplayed in the bedroom and when she left he probably was messed up about it. In my opinion she drove bourdain to suicide when she cheated on him.

              She is one sick perverted mess.  Sad that she got that way from whatever her Dad let happen to her.  I am so very against the abuse and pedophilia, but Gosh, I always have to wonder what happened to these people while growing up themselves.  A vicious vicious cycle. Her father directs Italian Horror Movies.  Think about that.

                I couldn't even get past that first picture at the beginning.  Him looking at her and all I could think was what was going through his mind.  He surely was already her bf.  Sick Sick Sick Sick Sick is all I can say.  That pic says a 1K words.
