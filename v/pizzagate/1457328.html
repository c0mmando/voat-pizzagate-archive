<p>Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Menendez (born January 1, 1954) is the senior United States Senator from the State of New Jersey.</p>
<p>He was indicted on corruption charges in 2015 misusing political authority to help friend and donor Salomon Melgen in exchange for gifts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In assist to donor ( Salomon Melgen), Menendez urged US to withhold port security equipment from Dominican Republic.
(<a href="http://archive.is/U0ayI">http://archive.is/U0ayI)</a>)</p>
<p>The Dominican Republic is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor.

</blockquote>
<p>Considering these facts, why would a United States Senator try to withhold port security?! The Dominican Republic borders with Haiti.</p>
<p>Now it gets interesting...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is alleged that Menendez and Melgen had sex with underage prostitutes at Melgen’s villa in Casa de Campo, Dominican Republic.

<p>Connection to Jeffrey Epstein? Well, what about this...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the women listed in wealthy pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s “black book” as a massage provider at his Palm Beach mansion last year ran unsuccessfully for Congress and once accompanied a prominent U.S. senator Robert Menendez to a White House state dinner, records show. But Gwendolyn Beck told TSG she has no idea why her name and phone numbers appear in a list that includes contact information for &gt;masseuses and some of Epstein’s underage female victims, who performed naked massages for the convicted sex offender...
(<a href="http://archive.is/zeK7M">http://archive.is/zeK7M)</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein donated towards Gwendolyn Beck\'s local congressional campaign.
(<a href="http://archive.is/KH2fp">http://archive.is/KH2fp)</a>)</p>
<p>Considering all these allegations Hillary Clinton still didn\'t have any problems backing the politician.</p>

<p>&quot;This summer Senator Menendez campaigned with Chelsea Clinton in New Jersey.&quot;

<p>Will he get convicted?</p>

<p>The Bob McDonnell Supreme Court ruling makes convicting politicians of corruption almost impossible

<p>Why mention Bob McDonnell?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>What???</p>
<p>So let\'s have a look at this Salomon Melgen fellow...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Melgen, a Palm Beach County eye surgeon, was arrested in April for bilking Medicare out of more than $100 million. His alleged scheme was simple: convince elderly patients to undergo macular degeneration treatments they might not need, treat said patients with expensive drugs, and make Medicare pay for it. In 2012, Melgen received $21 million from Medicare, the highest sum in the nation, according to the New York Times.&quot;

</blockquote>
<p>Not exactly the most trustworthy person... though he seems to be connected to many top politicians in the government....</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A news report on the South Florida surgeon accused of providing free travel and underage prostitutes to Sen. Robert Menendez describes Terry McAuliffe, the Democrat running for Virginia governor, as one of the doctor’s “good friends.”
(<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/va-politics/report-mcauliffe-menendez-donor-good-friends/2013/01/31/61abd184-6bd9-11e2-8740-9b58f43c191a_story.html?utm_term=.0bb3bc3825f2">https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/va-politics/report-mcauliffe-menendez-donor-good-friends/2013/01/31/61abd184-6bd9-11e2-8740-9b58f43c191a_story.html?utm_term=.0bb3bc3825f2)</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Terry McAuliffe?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clinton ultra-loyalist (Terry McAuliffe) gave $500,000 to campaign of wife of FBI deputy director who oversaw probe into Hillary\'s emails

<p>But check this out... Bill and Hillary were hosted at Salomon\'s villa in the Dominican Rebublic...</p>
<blockquote>

<p>At the beginning of this post I mentioned that Menendez urged US to withhold port security equipment from Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>The company that Salomon ran was called BOARDER SUPPORT SERVICES, LLC
(<a href="https://florida.intercreditreport.com/company/boarder-support-services-llc-l09000106859">https://florida.intercreditreport.com/company/boarder-support-services-llc-l09000106859)</a>)</p>
<p>So I checked the agent name: RIVERA LUIS C (p) the address being  320 DAVIE BLVD, FORT LAUDERDALE, FL, 33315

<p>If you look at companies registered at the same address you will find a business called MRW Consuting Group...</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Now the name does not exactly match but the address matches and if you do some more searches it you will find the \'C\' stands for Luis O. Rivera, CPA, CFE, CFF

<p>Interesting that a consulting firm involved in anti-corruption, financial fraud investigations is cooperating with someone who is accused of mass corruption...  
</p>
<p>Well MRW Consulting Group contributed towards Menendez\'s campaign for the Senate. </p>

<p>And now they are protecting Menendez\'s corruption charges...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update (Nov. 2, 11:40 a.m.): A certified public accountant and licensed private investigator representing Salomon Melgen contacted the ?Washington Free Beacon this morning with the following statement, which we publish here in full:
Please be advised that the article as written concerning the fact pattern regarding the debt to IRS in not accurate, does not provide salient details, portrays a picture that borders on “Defamation of Character” and fails to report on the actual communications, agreements and issues caused and resolved by the IRS, as well as the initial and subsequent errors by the IRS that created the situation that gave rise to the filing of the liens.

<p>There is no smoking gun here but I hope you can see that there is a network of corrupt people working together covering each others backs. Pedophilia is part of the conspiracy and is used to blackmail politicians to push an agenda. There is clear pay-to-play evidence but it seems that these people are above the law.</p>
<p>To finish off...</p>

           <p>
            "Melgen, a Palm Beach County eye surgeon, was arrested in April for bilking Medicare out of more than $100 million. His alleged scheme was simple: convince elderly patients to undergo macular degeneration treatments they might not need, treat said patients with expensive drugs, and make Medicare pay for it. In 2012, Melgen received $21 million from Medicare, the highest sum in the nation, according to the New York Times."

           There is no smoking gun here but I hope you can see that there is a network of corrupt people working together covering each others backs. Pedophilia is part of the conspiracy and is used to blackmail politicians to push an agenda. There is clear pay-to-play evidence but it seems that these people are above the law.

            Oh, my God let's just list who is NOT involved.  This is of epic proportions.  Menendez was mentioned in the news last year for these very things minus the trafficking.  They even showed pictures of him laying by the pool in the Dom. Rep.  The only way he will get charged is if this whole thing blows up and they all fall like dominoes.  Let's cross our fingers.
