<pre><code>Georgina Chapman, 41, announced Tuesday that she was leaving Weinstein
The couple have been married for 10 years and have two children, aged 7 and 4
She said her \'heart breaks for all the women who have suffered\' at his hands
Weinstein has been accused of sexual harassment, assault and rape
On Monday he boarded a private jet to Europe, where he will undergo rehab
The live-in facility will help him deal with sex and behavioral issues
Chapman is reportedly also concerned about Weinstein\'s affect on her company
He helped find A-listers to promote her high-class fashion brand Marchesa
But she\'s allegedly more worried that associations with him will put people off 
On Thursday it emerged that he had paid off eight women over such claims
Since then countless other stories have emerged from across Hollywood

             Chapman reached out to Abedin, the soon-to-be ex-wife of convicted sex offender Anthony Weiner

            I wonder what they had to discuss.

            From the same page &gt;Plus, the Clintons rented a Hamptons house next door to Weinstein and Chapman’s Amagansett estate for three summers.

            There is no way she didn't know what the dirty old grub had been up to for years.  Hollywood is a small town and everyone talks.  Everyone in Hollywood knew he was a serial sexual abuser, harasser and rapist, but of course everyone was too frightened to make it public, because Weinstein had the best lawyers, a whole PR team that could destroy anyone's reputation, and he had the power himself to destroy anyone's career with one phone call.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course she knew.  She just turned a blind eye to it because it suited her.  As long as it didn't affect her and her home, she didn't care.  Sorry, I'm a feminist and I don't like to bag women, but the truth is the truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seriously, what woman could be attracted to that fat, old ape?  This has probably been an easy excuse for her to leave him.  And it gives her plenty of leverage with the divorce to get as much money as possible from him.

             Of course she knew. I mean, I knew. His behavior has been well documented going back to the 90s (yeah, F U Ms Streep). This just means she doesn't have to wait around till he croaks to get her retirement package since his lawyers would've ate her up in court if she tried filing for divorce before this.
