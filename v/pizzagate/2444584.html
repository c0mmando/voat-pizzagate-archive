            Hi there
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Tazzermalt">
             @Tazzermalt
            </a>
            . Welcome to Voat. Please check out the submission rules for
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            in the sidebar on the right (view desktop site if on mobile). Unfortunately, you haven't provided an explanation of how this is relevant to the sexual abuse of kids by the global elite (Pizzagate). And since you made this a Link post instead of Discuss post, I can't give you our 24 Hour Removal Reprieve flair to edit it (Link posts can't be edited). Please repost per the submission rules, or as is in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            , our catch-all subverse. Thanks. Removing per Rules 1 and 3.

            Summary
           </p>
           <p>
            “Kek” is a translation of the acronym “LOL” (laugh out loud) when reading text written by members of the Horde faction as an Alliance player in the online multiplayer game World of Warcraft (WoW). “Kek” is also associated with the unrelated Turkish snack food Topkek, which is often discussed on the /s4s/ (Shit 4chan Says) board on 4chan.

            the stupidass article .... Russians released anti-Clinton video game weeks before election
by Jose Pagliery and Donie O'Sullivan   @ CNNTech March 8, 2018
            <a href="https://archive.is/IdzY7">
             https://archive.is/IdzY7
            </a>
            mainstream media sucks now? The game consisted of three levels, starting with this one: "Help Hillary delete as many classified emails as possible before she is caught." Players controlled a Hillary Clinton character who sits on a missile and eliminates emails, all while avoiding FBI agents.
The next level asked: "How much money can Hillary get from the Arab states?" At the top of the screen, nations' flags drop money. At the bottom, the Clinton character holds a basket to collect the cash as it falls.
The final level challenged users to "Help Hillary throw the Constitution as far as possible," and it included caricatures of then-President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton.
The game's website had Facebook and Google tracking software embedded on it. This software would have made it possible for the game's creators to identify people who played the game and later target them with advertising elsewhere on the Web, including on Facebook, potentially to direct them to disinformation campaigns.
Hilltendo would have been a relatively simple game to build, said Brian Moore, a New York-based developer who built the viral anti-Republican video game "GOP Arcade."
