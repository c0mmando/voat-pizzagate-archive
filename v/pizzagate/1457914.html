            Also, The Millennium Report is writing excellent articles about this. I'm getting good responses by spreading them via email, on FB, and in the comments sections of articles on sites like Breitbart, TheGatewayPundit, TheConservativeTreehouse, and any other site that has open comments sections.

            The point is that we've got to keep pushing this out to "average" folks, who didn't get involved with the original wikileaks research, etc...and who don't use social media, aren't going to come here to this site, etc.

            The angle that works for me is to start with human trafficking. Everyone is at least vaguely aware of that issue. Then, from there, I show them how missing children tie into trafficking. From there, it's easier to shift them to understanding the pedophile connection. It's a process of educating them. Give them the big picture, then they make the smaller, more critical connections rapidly.

            We're definitely gaining ground. There are regular posts/discussions about Pizzagate on the totally normie website FreeRepublic. (
            <a href="http://freerepublic.com">
             http://freerepublic.com)
            </a>
            )
           </p>
           <p>
            FR is a  site where approved members post news articles, and then comment about / discuss them. Readership/membership tends to be much older, 35-80 age range, folks who don't use social media other than FB. I did a site search this morning, for &lt;pizzagate&gt; by keyword and in title. Check out these results (and read the comments sections) !!

                Ah, you're a long-timer there! I joined just this year, lurked before that. I'm chuckling, because I think you're right, my idea of "normie" is likely way off. Thanks for the "reality check" ! ;-)

                 No, It's funny because FR has in fact become a normie site. Ideas we kind of take for granted now (at about 50% of the country) were somewhat radical to speak about back then. A website dedicated to aggregating and discussing news from a conservative viewpoint got it labelled as a home of conspiracy theorists and people were considered pariahs for admitting they spent time there.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Rathergate was a big deal in its time, it was the first crowdsourced investigation that I was aware of. Not sure what revisionist history says, but it significantly contributed to the downfall of Dan Rather, who was a teller of lies cloaked as mainstream news.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There are some here who are waiting for the media to cover pizzagate, but rathergate shows that the media is a large part of the problem. There won't be coverage until the voice of the people shame them into it. That is why I am grateful to see the eyes of the internet turn toward pizzagate. This target is larger, more nebulous, and more powerful, but I've seen what the light of truth can do when people use it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I believe there is a time and purpose for all things. FR is a shell of its former self for various reasons, but it seems the culmination of its purpose was in rathergate. The Donald may have just fulfilled its purpose in getting Trump elected and funneling pizzagate info to the public.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I think we are in for the longest and hardest battle for our lives with pizzagate. Gird yourselves, and do not grow weary of doing good.

                  Thank you for taking the time to write that explanation, and to give your perspective on FR and T_D. I hadn't thought about it in this context, and I agree with what you say !
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I also agree completely that we're in for the longest, hardest battle with pizzagate. I've added daily prayers for our effort, and for the children. The evil MUST be defeated. I'm in it for the long haul. :-)

            Need to make a new twitter hashtag. #PizzaGate is suppressed, although many people are posting non-stop.

             True. #littlelivesmatter or #investigatenow or something. Just the suppression its trending is devastating to the widespread reach of this very important information that   really everyone on the planet should be aware of tbh

            I agree with you, we are starting to make headway. This is not going away, and is way beyond a critical mass. It is a matter of time in my opinion.
We are many, they are few. And they fear numbers. We MUST continue to push.
