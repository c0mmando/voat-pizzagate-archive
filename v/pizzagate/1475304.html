            Ask him, what he thinks about pizzagate. What he knows about it. What his judgement is.
By that you can at least learn, how a professional (even if he is not telling the truth) is argueing.

            Have known a couple. Depends on personality and how long out of FBI I think.
Likely outcomes:
1) call the local office and give a statement.
2) call x number and ask to speak to sp agent y
3) stay out of it; you got death wish or something?
May or may not tell you anecdotes from their career etc as a bonus.
Btw if confidential they have zero ties.
If they have ties and/or even remember their oath,  it ain't exactly confidential if you go into criminal matters.
But you could definitely learn some things from such people. They Have knowledge.
