This is the case from a few weeks ago that was getting FBI involvement:</p>

<p>One of the majors named in the lawsuit (Curtis Flaherty) was one of three majors announced last week concerning the &quot;retire or be demoted&quot; shakeup.  The city council is in an uproar concerning one of the other majors who was also given the ultimatum (Jimmy Harper).  This is where former DC chief Charles Ramsey comes in:</p>
<p><em>Members of the RCFOP board of directors recently had an opportunity to meet with Charles Ramsey, former chief of police in DC and Philadelphia.  AT THE VERY MOMENT these board members were telling Chief Ramsey about Major Harper’s courage and leadership ability, Major Harper was being notified of the scheduled meeting at which he would learn of his demotion.</em></p>

<p>Now the Louisville police chief is being asked to resign :</p>
<p><a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2017/05/26/where-metro-council-members-stand-chief-conrads-police-shakeup/349689001/">http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2017/05/26/where-metro-council-members-stand-chief-conrads-police-shakeup/349689001/</a></p>
<p>Here is an article naming the 3 NEW majors.  Notice 2 of them have worked in &quot;crimes against children&quot;.</p>

<p>So, I started doing some digging on this former DC chief, Ramsey (formerly a Chicago officer), and came across the following:</p>
<p><em>&quot;If the president’s idea of reforming policing practices includes mass false arrests, brutality, and the eviscerating of civil rights, then Ramsey’s his man. That’s Charles Ramsey’s legacy in D.C.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) from 1998 to early 2007. In January 2017, he became a regular CNN contributor&quot;</em></p>

<p>Something isn\'t smelling right to me.  What do you all think?  Could there be a massive ring interlocking these police forces together?</p>
<p>Here is some additional info on the scandal going on in Louisville that  I might make into a separate post later on.</p>
<p>Last week a 4th officer had been named:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2017/05/27/fourth-louisville-police-officer-embroiled-explorer-program-sex-abuse-scandal/350741001/">http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2017/05/27/fourth-louisville-police-officer-embroiled-explorer-program-sex-abuse-scandal/350741001/</a></p>
<p>After this story broke the LMPD suspended the youth program and took down the website:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/metro-government/2017/03/23/louisville-police-take-down-explorer-website-amid-sex-abuse-scandal/99535212/">http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/metro-government/2017/03/23/louisville-police-take-down-explorer-website-amid-sex-abuse-scandal/99535212/</a></p>
<p>Thanks to our friend the &quot;Wayback Machine&quot; I was able to do some digging into the 4 officers named.</p>
<p>Flaherty was the LEAD advisor in the Explorer program at least since 2004 according to this screen capture:</p>

<p>Betts, Wood, &amp; Schumann were all in leadership positions during their time as explorers according to this screenshot:</p>

            My petition got the special gay police of America website shut down in 2010. I hosted videos on my vid me channel that got censored of gay activists saying only gay police who do gay sex acts can investigate a fellow homosexual, and I have gay leaders in Australia writing papers that to investigate one gay pedophile is to investigate all gays therefore they must not be investigated.

            Special gay police have a long history of protecting gay pedophiles and the gay agenda. See the papers on the links above where the man who wrote the book for Australian Marriage Equality on gay marriage is saying that Robert Dolly Dunn infamous mass child rapist and boylover is innocent until proven guilty, and how dare that unrepentant jailed boylover until the day he died who was given police protection (P16 Immunity form) be investigated in the great "gay witchhunt" before his extradition and jailing.

            The Gay Rights lobby and pedophilia always intersect. Just see Alefantis working with Terry Beans (pedophile) Gay and Lesbian Victory fund to see what I mean.
