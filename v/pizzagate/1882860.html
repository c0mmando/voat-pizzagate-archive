<blockquote>
<p>One of Mohamed Atta\'s closest associates in Florida before the 9/11 attack today carries a chest on his yacht filled with several million dollars in new bills, automatic weapons, passports from a half-dozen nations, and works for a major international Mobster.
Wolfgang Bohringer, a German pilot, identified by Atta’s one-time girlfriend Amanda Keller as one of Mohamed Atta’s closest associates in Florida during the run-up to the 9.11 attack, and one of the handful of people the terrorist ringleader called “my brother,” recently resurfaced on a tiny island in the South Pacific, in the Republic of Kiribati.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://cannonfire.blogspot.co.uk/2006/11/terror-island-fbi-discovers-attas-pal.html">Terror island: The FBI discovers Atta\'s pal</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ever hear of Kiribati? Probably not. Yet this tiny Pacific island nation deserves your attention, for it is the most recent home of a mystery man named Wolfgang Bohringer -- a German pilot associated with Mohammed Atta.</p>
<p>Bohringer came to Fanning Island (part of the Kiribati chain -- incidentally, the name is pronounced &quot;Kiribas&quot;) to set up a flight training school. He planned to specialize in training for the DC3, an old warhorse of an aircraft much favored by smugglers.
The intrepid Daniel Hopsicker has been tracking Bohringer for some time -- ever since Amanda Keller (Atta\'s girlfriend, although she has recently tried to retract the claim) described the Atta/Bohringer relationship. The two men were so close that Atta referred to the German as &quot;my brother.&quot; When Hopsicker learned of Bohringer\'s presence on Fanning Island, officials became aware of the well-heeled newcomer\'s odd history.</p>
<p>Apparently, Bohringer has confessed to Fanning Island natives that he knew Atta, <strong>although he has denied involvement with the 9/11 plot</strong>.</p>

            Terror island: The FBI discovers Atta's pal
           </a>

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Ever hear of Kiribati? Probably not. Yet this tiny Pacific island nation deserves your attention, for it is the most recent home of a mystery man named Wolfgang Bohringer -- a German pilot associated with Mohammed Atta.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bohringer came to Fanning Island (part of the Kiribati chain -- incidentally, the name is pronounced "Kiribas") to set up a flight training school. He planned to specialize in training for the DC3, an old warhorse of an aircraft much favored by smugglers.
The intrepid Daniel Hopsicker has been tracking Bohringer for some time -- ever since Amanda Keller (Atta's girlfriend, although she has recently tried to retract the claim) described the Atta/Bohringer relationship. The two men were so close that Atta referred to the German as "my brother." When Hopsicker learned of Bohringer's presence on Fanning Island, officials became aware of the well-heeled newcomer's odd history.
           </p>
           <p>
            Apparently, Bohringer has confessed to Fanning Island natives that he knew Atta,
            <strong>
             although he has denied involvement with the 9/11 plot
            </strong>
            .
