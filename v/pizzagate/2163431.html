           <blockquote>
            <p>
             We now know Sir Cyril Smith was held then released by police seven times throughout his career, despite being found with abuse videos in his car and despite actually being caught abusing boys; we now know police were told not to arrest Lord Greville Janner back in the 1980s, despite his apparent connection to the abuse; we now know that accusations against Lord Leon Brittan were so numerous that police have continued to investigate the former Home Secretary in earnest after his death; we now know that Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, an alleged Elm Guest House visitor whom one woman says she was raped by when she was four, in his time called for tighter controls on press freedom regarding the sexual proclivities of MPs.
            </p>
            <p>
             We also know that Sir Peter Morrison, aide and confidant to Margaret Thatcher, was reportedly let go by police after he raped a 14-year-old boy at the Elm Guest House in 1982, while it’s claimed that Peter Righton, the social care worker who advised the government on child care, carried out a brutal murder on the estate of diplomat Lord John Henniker in the early 90s. In total, 18 separate inquiries are now underway into how people in authority were involved in the abuse of children across the UK during this time. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is currently investigating 17 allegations of police protecting establishment abusers from the 1970s to the 2000s. Meanwhile, as the government inquiry balloons in scope, more names are revealed as suspects all the time.
            </p>
            <p>
             There’s Harvey Proctor, an ex-Conservative MP expelled from the party after appearing in court for beating rent boys in 1986; former Attorney General Sir Michael Havers, who curbed an investigation into Northern Ireland’s Kincora boys’ home and refused to prosecute Paedophile Information Exchange member Sir Peter Hayman for exchanging indecent material; Enoch Powell, the Conservative MP best known for his racially-charged ‘rivers of blood’ speech; Labour MP Leo Abse and ex-Commons Speaker Viscount George Thomas; Conservative MPs Sir Rhodes Boyson and Baron Keith Joseph; former Chief of General Staff Lord Edwin Bramall; and David Atkinson, a Conservative MP linked to the scandal by his own wife and son.
            </p>
            <p>
             You also have Cliff Richard, ‘Babes in the Wood’ killer Ronald Jebson, an unnamed royal, a serving MP, a 1960s pop group, a female former MP, and another pop star whom deceased Elm Guest House owner Carole Kasir claimed took part in a “violent paedophile orgy overseas that resulted in a boy’s death”. The scale of the investigation now beggars belief – there are actors and priests covered for by police, alleged paedophile rings at Buckingham Palace, and millionaire businessmen using their own care homes to provide child sex parties with boys. One former detective along with Kevin Allen, the brother of Martin Allen, who went missing aged 15 in 1979 and who is thought to have been abducted and murdered by the VIP paedophile ring, believe the Westminster abuse set had ties to child sex trafficking in Europe.

            "The lucrative young boy trade in Europe”
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Kevin and Martin’s father, Tom Allen, was head chauffeur for the Australian high commission in London in the 70s, and part of the same car firm that also hired Ronald Jebson, notorious paedophile Sidney Cooke, and David Smith, Jimmy Savile’s chauffeur. It’s thought that Cooke and other drivers would around that time pick up young boys and deliver them to organised orgies in Barnes, Pimlico and Kensington; Kevin Allen thinks his brother may have been spotted by one of these drivers as a potential victim. Says Jaquelin Magnay for The Australian: “one now-retired lead detective believes Cooke is behind the disappearance of at least 17 boys and the Dutch police believe he was involved in trafficking young boys for the lucrative young boy trade in Europe”.

             If the Dutch police believe he was involved in trafficking young boys for the lucrative young boy trade in Europe then WTH are they not doing anything about it.  They have all been bought out or fear for their lives or both.  Thank you for bringing this to our attention.  There are just far too many of these stories.  Upvoat4U
