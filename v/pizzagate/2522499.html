<p>I decided to look into Tester and found it odd that he had been involved the adoption of children in Haiti after the earthquake. Here is some info Dated Feb 04 on Tester launching an online resource center for adopting Haitian children. <a href="http://archive.is/lQG2y">http://archive.is/lQG2y</a></p>
<p>In the article it mentions about how the previous month, he had been working with Secretary Clinton and DHS Napolitano on how to expedite the process of adopting children in Haiti.

<p>I just find it interesting that Tester was pushing Clinton and Napolitano to expedite the transfer of Children to the U.S. on January 20th and then on Jan. 29th, Laura Silsby and 9 other Americans were busted in Haiti trafficking as many as 33 Children. <a href="http://archive.is/mqeF3">http://archive.is/mqeF3</a></p>
<p>Another interesting piece of info is that Jon Tester is a freemason, atleast according to his bio, in which he attends Treasure Lodge #95 in Big Sandy, MT.
<a href="http://archive.li/GPH1Y">http://archive.li/GPH1Y</a></p>

<p>What exactly does this guy have in his closet? Was Trump trying to lead us somewhere? Think more eyes need to be on Tester to see if any connections to the New Life Children\'s Refuge and the Americans arrested in Haiti or anything else that could uncover what it is that Trump &quot;Knew&quot; that is so damaging about this hopefully short lived Senator.</p>',

            I haven’t noticed if you guys have been talking about Jon Tester. But, yesterday On 8chan or Twitter, I saw a meme calling him a child molester. I had it on my list of things to look into. Seeing that and reading this email is making me really curious. Especially Trump saying that. I need to watch!

             Appreciate it Syrazie! Just came across a HRC Wikileaks Email from Hillary CC:Huma asking staff to reach out to Testers office to discuss their orphan process. He had 15 families ready to adopt.

            . Owns and operates a family farm. Lost 3 fingers in a meat grinder as a child. Yes man for President Obama. January 13, 2009, during Tester's second session of Congress, he was given a seat on the Appropriations Committee.[32] In 2013, Tester became chairman of the Banking Committee's Securities, Insurance, and Investment Subcommittee.[33]
           </p>
           <p>
            In September 2013, he announced opposition to the appointment of Larry Summers as chairman of the Federal Reserve; lacking a committee majority Summers then withdrew his name from consideration. Lots to dig through.

            Jon Tester and his wife reportedlly used to operate an unlicensed custom butchering service at their farm, and despite repeated visits from state health inspectors, no punitive action was ever taken and no license was apparently ever mandated or obtained.  Tester closed down the butchering operation in 1998, the same year he first ran for state office in Montana.

            <strong>
             Tester's butcher business never licensed
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            JENNIFER McKEE - IR State Bureau - 10/31/2006 Oct 30, 2006 0
           </p>
           <p>
            HELENA - Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Jon Tester never had a state-required license for the butchering business he ran at his Big Sandy-area farm. State records show an inspector visited the shop, but did not cite Tester for breaking the law.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tester cut meat in an outbuilding on his family farm beginning in the late 1970s. He took the butcher business over from his father, Tester said, who first started cutting meat in the family's basement in the 1950s to make extra money. Tester took the business over after he and his wife assumed the family farm, he said, and realized they couldn't make enough money farming.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tester said his father never had a license and he didn't realize he needed a license, either.
           </p>
           <p>
            Failure to have a license for the kind of custom butchering Tester did is a misdemeanor, according to state law, punishable by a $500 fine. However, Tester said several inspectors had come to look at the place over the years and he was never cited, fined or told to get a license.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The state knew about it because they'd been out," Tester said.
           </p>
           <p>
            State records show a compliance officer visited Tester's farm in 1990, but he was never cited for anything, including a lack of a license.
           </p>
           <p>
            State law lays out three different levels for meat cutters in Montana. People who cut meat for their own use do not need any license at all. People who cut up meat brought to them by the owner of the livestock for the owner's own personal use need a license and are generally inspected several times a year, said Carol Olmstead, chief of the Montana Department of Livestock's Meat Inspection Bureau. However, these meat cutters need not be inspected daily and do not have to stamp their meat with the official state inspected seal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, wholesale meat cutters - people who cut meat to be sold to grocery stores and the like - must have a license, be inspected daily and stamp their meat with an official stamp.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tester fell into the middle category. He cut meat for livestock owners, mostly neighbors, he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tester said an inspector came to the place in the early 1970s when his dad was running it.
            <strong>
             The first time an inspector came to the shop under Tester's ownership was in the early 1990s. That inspector came in with a gun, said Tester, who asked the man to leave in a heated exchange.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             A few days later, Tester said, "another inspector came out and said, 'Fine."'
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            State records show that inspector later sent Tester a copy of the state sanitation regulations that Tester requested.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1998, when Tester was considering scaling back the operation, a third inspector came out.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I said, 'Look, if there's any problems here, just tell me and we'll board it up,' " Tester said. The man brought up no problems.
           </p>
           <p>
            He closed the butcher operation voluntarily later that year, the same year Tester ran for his first term in the state Senate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Erik Iverson, a spokesman for Republican Sen. Conrad Burns, said he found Tester's explanation thin.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             "I have a difficult time believing that a guy who rose to the president of the Montana Senate didn't know that he needed a license to operate his (meat cutting) business,"
            </strong>
            [said] Iverson. "This is proof positive that the only law breaker in this race is Jon Tester."
           </p>
           <p>
            Iverson's comment was a reference to Tester's use of automated fundraising phone calls earlier this year in the Democratic Senate primary election.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Jon Tester does not need a lecture on the law from someone currently under two separate federal investigations," said Tester spokesman Matt McKenna.
           </p>
           <p>
            McKenna's comments refer to the U.S. Justice Department lobbying scandal investigation and a second probe into a troubled University of Montana space spin-off company initially funded with millions of federal dollars earmarked by Burns.

            Trivia:
           </p>
           <p>
            Jon Tester lost three fingers of his left hand in a meat grinder as a 9-year-old on the family farm.

             Sen. John Tester's Nephew Found Killed Inside His Home
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            By J.J. GALLAGHER
           </p>
           <p>
            Sep 8, 2016, 3:26 AM ET
           </p>
           <p>
            A nephew of U.S. Senator Jon Tester was killed in his home in Washington state by a man suspected of wielding an ax and telling his 8-year-old daughter to stay in her room because he was going to kill her father, police said Wednesday night.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bob Tester, 35, was found lying in a pool of blood in his residence outside the city of Spokane on Tuesday morning, reports KXLY, a local ABC affiliate.
           </p>
           <p>
            "We do not believe that this was a random act," said Mark Gregory of the Spokane Sheriff's Office. "We do believe that the suspect knew the victim."
           </p>
           <p>
            Along with the police report, authorities also released the full text of Tester’s last Facebook post.
           </p>
           <p>
            “There’s gonna be some hard days ahead of us but i want you all to know that I was victimized by someone close to me," the Aug. 25 post reads. "He took my best friend from me and turned her life into darkness, thru drugs and manipulation… Just understand why I roar when i do. Understand my agony.”
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Tester's 8-year-old daughter told police she was asleep in bed with her father
            </strong>
            when she was awoken by a man beating him and wielding what the young girl described as “a sword and a knife,” according to court documents.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The man told her to stay in bed because he was going to kill her dad,” the police report states.
           </p>
           <p>
            Officers say they found a blood-stained wood-splitting ax lying next to Tester’s body, in “a large pool of blood.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Deputies described a gruesome scene, with "blood on the walls and floor throughout the residence,” the court documents state.
           </p>
           <p>
            The young girl called her grandmother to report the death.
           </p>
           <p>
            Deputies also reported finding bags of marijuana near the body and said that the home smelled of pot. The girl’s grandmother told deputies her son grew marijuana for several dispensaries, KXLY reported.
           </p>
           <p>
            Authorities say they have not detained a suspect in the case so far, noting that they will be looking into the victim's cell phone records for any possible leads.
           </p>
           <p>
            Senator Jon Tester’s press office said “his family would prefer privacy during this difficult time."

             How did we miss this!? HRC Wiki Email from Hillary CC:Huma, that asks for someone to reach out to Testers staff to discuss their Orphan process. He had 15 families ready to adopt.

              I don’t think that’s a big deal. I think we see things so different because of what we’ve learned here. But I love it when there’s a relationship like that between father and daughter. Most men aren’t pervs. Maybe she had nightmares.

              When I was 10, there was a major event in my life and I slept in bed with my dad for a few weeks. It was nothing weird or even cuddling. I think it’s different when it involves other men. But not a dad.

               I see your point and also admit that possibly she was scared about something or he was trying to protect her from something HE was scared about or was afraid might happen.  And it did.  His worst fears came true.  There could be much more to this story and why he kept her with him.

              Maybe yes and maybe no. That Facebook post could suggest he kept her with him because he feared for their lives. Now I fear for her life.

               Another way to look at it, I agree.  Possibly he and the daughter were going to be sacrificed.  It certainly makes one wonder when we hear Tester bring up these wild accusations for the Dems.  I have always thought of him being a sit on the fence Dem, saying whatever endears him to both sides.

                Surely you are aware that many dads rape and otherwise molest their daughers every day.  I'm very glad yours didn't, and I hope Tester didn't.

               <p>
                Obviously, an 8-year-old girl sleeping in her father's bed is not a definite indication of abuse, but it is a potential indication, aka a red flag---a point of fact to be kept in mind during an investigation.  I'm just laying out the facts, ma'am, not indicting the guy.
