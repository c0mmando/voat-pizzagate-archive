Subject: &quot;Thelema&quot; - a Favor</p>
<p>Dear Mary,</p>
<p>Hope you and the family are well. </p>
<p>Since John is no longer with the email address I have for him, would you
please forward this &quot;thelema&quot; (favor) to John ?</p>
<p>Our internist, of many years, has a 95 year old mother who is in &quot;Love&quot; with
President Barack Obama. In a recent visit, we got to talking politics and
she mentioned how her mother would want to meet the President. On hearing
of our relationship with John, our internist mentioned that her 95 year old
mother would even make the extra effort to come to D.C. to meet with the
president. Jean Houlihan, our internist, went on to say she would even make
a special trip with her mother to D C. to accomplish this if she could not
meet him somewhere in the Chicago area. </p>
<p>Edie Houlihan, the mother, was a social worker here in Chicago. She reared
6 children, 2 doctors, 2 lawyers, a nurse, and a successful business man.
Edie donates to all requests from the Obama\'s. We know you are inundated
with such requests but feel we had to give it a try. It\'s not something you
can make happen but can you suggest an approach the family can take to help
their Mom fulfill her &quot;Bucket List&quot;?</p>
<p>The attached is a picture of Edie with a Harvard Hat from her
Granddaughter, a recent graduate. I am not good at attaching Edie\'s picture,
so I am sending it with a forward from Dr. Jean Houlihan\'s email to me.</p>
<p>Hope you are understanding and will give me a response -- yes or no.</p>
<p>Hope all is well.</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Eugenia &amp; John</p>',

            The word thelema showing up at all in anybody's emails is very strange. Just like the word Moloch showing up in Hillary's emails. Most people have no idea what Moloch or Thelema are.

            Ah, no problem. Reading back, my response was possibly more vitriolic than I intended.
           </p>
           <p>
            The more I read about them in this context, the more biased I become against them. But prior to all this, I've studied from Liber Theta and other texts with a neutral view. What led me to research it in the first place was religious studies, so I guess that's why I lump it under the same term.
           </p>
           <p>
            In my eyes, cults are just underground religions which thus tend to have smaller followings, and also tend to follow "knowledge heirarchy" or pyramidal power structure. And, y'know, get associated with the darker topics like drugs and sacrifice and ritual sex.

            Jay-Z. Also, gatekeeping for religions? pls
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            "Will" can be considered a "superhuman controlling power" under the context of Thelema. So... Close enough?
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll use the phrase "occult religion/ceremonial magick" in the future.

             I think the occult or religion angle is the best way to connect the dots with these people. The art and symbols. The strange words used that are almost never used by non-occult people.

            It made me think that she was part of the club and wanted a favor. You are correct about ordinary people not knowing anything about it.

            I don't really see how this relates the the actual Thelema religion though, unless it's coded  pretty intricately.
           </p>
           <p>
            But Thelema doesn't mean favor (according to
            <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Thelema">
             Wikitionary
            </a>
            ) Transliteration of Ancient Greek θέλημα ‎(thélēma, “will”). So the question arises, why mention it at all? Maybe this old lady is a skilled Thelemic?
