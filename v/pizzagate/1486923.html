            Can anyone suggest the most concise, not too long video introduction to the case? No one around me has any idea what Pizzagate is and when I try to explain they look at me like I've lost my mind.

            Spread memes. There is one language that is universal: humour. The pedophilia itself is obviously not something to joke about. But the very bad, very obvious lies around the affair are an endless source of easy fun. It doesn't get more obvious, and we should turn these lies against them to ridicule them until they have lost all credibility. Just look at this extract of tweets to Podesta's first tweet after 35 days. Hard not to LOL at that :)

            A 2nd sub focussed on outreach (not research) for the uninitiated, with memes, infographics, catchy rhetoric, videos, all the best modern forms of Internet viral marketing. Like a warm Kid's Pool before they swim in the ocean. A bit like The_Donald compared to 4chan or whatever. Then we can spread it, and set to auto-spread (using sites like ifttt.com), across social media. A sub of persuasive Public Ready posts that have high conversion rates..

            Send this "Where is Eric Braverman" video to everyone you know. Post on Facebook, mass email it to everyone in your contacts. It might not seem relevant but it's actually highly relevant. It will show just how disgustingly corrupt Hillary Clinton is and make PizzaGate seem A LOT more plausible:

            I've said it many times in this forum, but we need to start with the clear foothold. Jeffrey Epstein had an
            <a href="http://www.pizzagate.review/index.php/Jeffrey_Epstein#Irregularities_within_the_Legal_Proceedings">
             illegal/unconstitutional plea bargain
            </a>
            . If we start with the prosecution of his unidentified co-conspirators, we can gain our first foothold. The case already has everything we need - a designated criminal (Ghislaine Maxwell, Jean Luc Brunel and many more), designated victims (Virginia Roberts and many more already identified), it does not fall under the statute of limitations because the children were being trafficked internationally, and the media acknowledges that Jeffrey Epstein got away with it.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can't bring someone to trial for gross photos in their home or on their Instagram. However, you can demand that a plea bargain be overturned in a court of law if it is unenforceable. Once we have these criminals behind bars, we will begin to gain legitimacy and, ultimately, I believe their arrests will lead to more leads. I mean, Maxwell was at Chelsea Clinton's wedding for christ's sake.

            I usually tell people that something enourmous is going on, like really something incredibly big and worrying. The JFK or Watergate of our time. That will grab attention and they probably will ask what this is all about? I say a stream of yet unexplained circumstancial evidence found by an ongoing collaborative research that could indicate a scandal involving child abuse and the elite in the US and the explicit anti-movement of censoring happening everywhere combined with the MSM debunking it without any investigation. I proceed with saying: Even if the allegations or suspiciouns are 1% true, claiming their 100% fake and not researching is unethical and that is what's happening.. This usually opens people up to learn more about it and you can just show them lots of different bits of informations. Don't make allegations, just show the heaps of suspicious things going on and emphasize on the fact that no law enforment agency has actually debunked any of it, let people decide for themselves. Your role is to introduce them into the findings of the research, try being unbiased as to what the end result may be. If it's true or not it's just shocking that we are finding all of this... yes use Pizzagate ALWAYS refer to Pizzagate!

            Thank God America is the most heavily armed country on earth.   The civilians have enormous amount of weapons.....England and Austraila not so much.   They let their guns be stolen by false flags.   But hopefully that will soon change.

            I brought up the idea to donate popular Twitch-Streamer with 2$ and a message focused on #Pizzagate. That way thousands and tenthousands (depending on who you donate to) will see the message. And almost every streamer takes his time to read and answer the message because you donated something.

             That has some potential, might look into that. Most streamers allow messages from 5$ though.

            Tell everyone who will listen.... dont force them....just tickle the fucking head with a feather....these folks have been propagandized so long it is going to be an absolute shock to their soul.  They will feel maybe like they are going nuts when their brain first starts allowing themselves to believe.   And I am personally well armed.  I live in a mostly white area....so I am fairly safe from riots....if you are not....gather some food and get weapons.   Its going to get nuts soon and might last a while.

            What is behind the use of international child trafficking for the purpose of blackmail? Dots are not being connected. This is much easier for people to understand. This may avoid the appearance of people being obsessed with thinking about and talking about child sex without advancing to investigating the real purpose. IMO it is a diversion that was created to take people off the scent trail leading to the truth.

              It looks to people who are not aware that this is an obsession with concentrating on thinking and talking about pedophilia. No one wants to do that. There are many posters that are not legitimate and keeping people into just looking and talking about the pedophilia by planting new PICS, and stories. The bigger story which is much easier to get people's attention and concern is that the GOV is doing this for favors and blackmail. What are the favors on both sides really? They are much worse than pedophilia.

            we can make an extensive email containing links to be sent to all media outlets. we can translate to all languages and flood all the newspapers with these mails.

            i'm from another country and journalists just don't seem to be aware of more than what the american MSM have to say about it. all they publish are pretty much just translations of MSM articles. i have already sent a lengthy mail to a few of my country's and neighbouring country's newspapers. the other day i even called a journalist of the foreign news department of our most serious newspaper. i asked him if they are going to take this seriously. he said yes of course. i say you mean from the point of view that so called fake news has dangerous consequences? he said yes. i then explained what's really going on and he found it the most ludicrous bullshit that pretty much everyone at the top would be involved. i pushed it and he said he would look into voat and into the PG summaries i would provide him. it became a lenghty mail in which i first tried to take off the psychological edge that you have to deal with believing that having so many people at the top are so evil by explaining that you have to be a pedofile/psychopat to be allowed at the top so you can be blackmailed. also i mentionned the jimmy savile and marc dutroux case. then i gave him several links to summaries and to voat, including the sub where the shooting is debunked. i put several of his colleagues in copy of the mail. no response yet.
EDITED for a spelling mistake.

             Did you get a response after that? I might try to send it to some popular news outlets that don't follow the general trend of the MSM. If you can provide me with the email or links in general, I can save alot of time and send it tonight already.

              i didn't get a response but i'll call the journalist in a few days to know if they are looking into it. i won't send you the mail 'cause it's in my language and it should be expanded and improved anyway. these are the links:

              i should have added explanations about some of the terminology used on voat like CTR (correct the record) and what it does, what are shills, bots, to be red pilled, MKultra, ... (although this last one has the risk of seeming too far stretched and making us sound nuts...)

            I might make some posters later, like the ones on #HillaryDraft. I feel that we need some people working on reeling the masses in and some other people working on informing them when they are interested.

           <p>
            Too many people will ship it off as conspiracy theories when we try to go too fast. They won't believe it because it's hard to believe anyway. I personally didn't want to believe as well, but this is reality.

            It is happening, we need to shed light on these fuckers.

            Won't that make us countershills? I mean, we can always flood the internet with images and info and posters but we need to keep in mind that alot of people get irritated if their social media keeps getting flooded with the same all over again. We need to make this attractive to the common folks. As far as I know, none of the news outlets has picked up this story so far or it has died out already. And while spreading stuff online is really effective to inform people, we are at a big disadvantage.
           </p>
           <p>
            The MSM has the higher ground and we need some tactics to take them down to us.

             I think we need counter measures against their psy ops and propaganda. Hopefully someone with more expertise can chime in. I really believe MSM will never support us or acknowledge us we have to proceed despite them. It's very unfortunate and disappointing.

            I keep sensing that we need to acknowledge the unknown victims. There are tombs dedicated to unknown soldiers, sailors lost at sea, years ago people tied a yellow ribbon for hostages. How can we acknowledge the unknown victims? A candlelight vigil? Some sort of pin? I wish I was creative that way. This movement for me is about rescuing missing and abused children. It is about Creating public pressure and Reminding the public that this is about protecting children not the overprivelidge elite. This will eventually get buried or forgotten by the population at large like the franklin scandal or dutroux unless we have a long plan, whether we find a smoking gun or not how are we going to keep this issue alive in the long term? The MSM will NEVER cooperate or support our movement. They are complicit. I think many of us including me keep hoping that the MSM will acknowledge what has been unconvered so far. My take: this movement will have no help from the MSM, how do we proceed despite thAt?

             You have a point there, alot keepa getting forgotten because of misinformation and distractions amd mostly false flag operations. But that's also the reason why we are doing this. People need to know this shit is happening. People need to find out about their crimes. Although we might not save a fraction of the children that were used and murdered, we need to think about them as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             But because it's so big and vast, people can hardly imagine this is really happening.

              Very true, I could not agree more. I think we are part of a new awakening that has the potential to change the world for the better. It's an enourmous undertaking though. Hard to know where to start.

             Can you collaborate on that? Do you mean that i should volunteer as a writer for the wiki? What wiki are you referring to? Because I won't post info on the wiki leaks page until they prove they are not compromised or anything.

              - pizzagate wiki - and no dont go anywhere near WikiL until further notice anything submitted after mid october is muck.
             </p>
             <p>
              Off topic but I think WikiL should be considered dead going forward. To many promises let down, if they are not completely compromised they are partially compromised and will continue to be but thats just my view.

            Just keep doing what you're doing. Tell as many people as you can (without out drawing too much attention to yourself), encourage friends to tell others, the more people that know about it the more we can do to solve it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even if you aren't great at research or analysis, just keep reading about it and help us weed out the shills on here.

             I will do. The biggest problem with telling people is the uneasiness of the subject. At first I didn't want to believe it, but the piles of evidence and allegations and weird symbols and choice of words of these fuckers took me over.

              Visuals (instagrams, pedo logos, posters of strange bands welcoming all ages, screen shots from the Heavy Breathing videos) can open eyes and the mind, moreso than text/word. It is moving people past "cognitive dissonance" where they just don't want to believe people can be like these monsters. The imagery helps break down that resistance...then the conversation follows. The "pizza code" aspect loses people. It needs to come AFTER they become engaged in the idea that these crimes against kids happens and that we have identified some of these people and where they operate.

              I agree, so far I've only told my close friends and prefaced it with something like "I think I might be going crazy, but the evidence of a global elite pedo ring is so overwhelming, what do you think?"

             On one side this might make some normies question it and let them search it themselves. On the other hand this will hurt our image as an investigation group and we might be put down by the MSM as "the hacker called 4chan" and simple trolls.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am thinking more interaction IRL, banners on highways, posters on billboards, flyers, etc.

               Although that would be ironic and definitely funny, it would be taken down instantly and whoever payed for it would lose their money and probably would get their info passed through. Correct me if I am wrong.

                Well no they would have to reject the banner in the first place.  There are other methods of taking over MSM legally with a team of 100 or so.
               </p>
               <p>
                For example, take any trending hashtag.  By having one of our team, tweet information with the trending hashtag - then the 100s of team members favourite and retweet it, so that it's rt/fav exceeds the pre-existing "top tweets", thus being positioned at the top of high traffic stream.

            There are some good posters and a good infographic in the sidebar, give those a go. Share them on your social media. They will gain interest, and then people can research further on their own. It is far too complex to explain to someone quickly without sounding crazy. So ease them into it with a few of those posters and the infographic. Also something you can do is keep fighting against mainstream media. Try and educate people about how the owners of the media are heavily implicated, so they cannot possibly be reporting the truth.

             Yeah, I've seen some of these posters posted here and I might share them. My biggest concern with those posters were indeed that they were not clear enough. I am openminded enough to be convinced of really weird things as long as proof backs it up. Not enough people have the same mindset though, they would rather believe MSM and corrupt politicians.
            </p>

             I might make some youtube videos on PizzaGate with episodic themes to ease people into the subject. Thoughts?
