            A word I saw recently was
            <em>
             paedophobia
            </em>
            - that being, of course,
            <em>
             a fear of children
            </em>
            . For some it might be a fear so strong and irrational that it becomes pure hatred, literally to the point of being criminal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, if anything this is just a part of the bigger problem, just like paedophilia is only some of it. There's definitely a much more perverse agenda at work here.

             Yes, thanks. I've read the essay about the deep state from Mike Lofgren wikileaks tweeted out a few weeks ago. This one:
             <a href="http://billmoyers.com/2014/02/21/anatomy-of-the-deep-state/">
              http://billmoyers.com/2014/02/21/anatomy-of-the-deep-state/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             But I am not too sure if those Insiders are acting alone. Because I saw
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXbwLFFYJhU">
              this interview with a star whacker
             </a>
             , which sadly can't be confirmed, where he states, that he is working with 5 people knowingly and plenty more unknowingly. To me it sounds like maybe 5 hanlders and their many victims? I am just guessing. But I have been working as a proffessionel writer for years and I have learned to always search for the system behind simular stories. So this is what I try to do right now.
