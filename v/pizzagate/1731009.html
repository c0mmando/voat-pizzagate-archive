<p>Could there be something to this theory? 
And if so, what should be our next step, in addition to the investigations of those who are maybe controlled by another invisible class?

            A word I saw recently was
            <em>
             paedophobia
            </em>
            - that being, of course,
            <em>
             a fear of children
            </em>
            . For some it might be a fear so strong and irrational that it becomes pure hatred, literally to the point of being criminal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, if anything this is just a part of the bigger problem, just like paedophilia is only some of it. There's definitely a much more perverse agenda at work here.

             Yes, thanks. I've read the essay about the deep state from Mike Lofgren wikileaks tweeted out a few weeks ago. This one:
             <a href="http://billmoyers.com/2014/02/21/anatomy-of-the-deep-state/">
              http://billmoyers.com/2014/02/21/anatomy-of-the-deep-state/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             But I am not too sure if those Insiders are acting alone. Because I saw
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXbwLFFYJhU">
              this interview with a star whacker
             </a>
             , which sadly can't be confirmed, where he states, that he is working with 5 people knowingly and plenty more unknowingly. To me it sounds like maybe 5 hanlders and their many victims? I am just guessing. But I have been working as a proffessionel writer for years and I have learned to always search for the system behind simular stories. So this is what I try to do right now.
