            It takes focus away from the real investigation of elite satanic pedophiles stealing children. Stay focused. You can see symbols everywhere most have no relation to pizzagate activities. Focus on the leads we have.

            The witch hunt for companies and organizations with supposed pedophile symbols in logos is becoming more annoying by the day. Do you realize that what you and others are suggesting is that pedophiles own and control an entire class of geometric constructions that is literally infinite? Do you realize how outrageous it is to try to connect each and every company and organization who uses a triangle or spiral in their logo with pedophiles? Newsflash. A snail is not a pedophile, and the Snail Appreciation Society takes great offense at your submission. Use some common sense. The only symbols that should be remotely associated with those published by the FBI as representing the pedo community are those that are unmistakably similar. Otherwise, it's incumbent upon
            <strong>
             you
            </strong>
            to do any research to find a link instead of potentially ruining a business through sheer incompetence or worse.

             I dont have the time to do the research and how the fuck could I ruin their business.  You sound like a shill trying to compare comet pizza to this.  Comet pizzas instagram and the.evidence ruined their business.  Show me one example of what you speak of.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you  did the research over the course of ten or so years youd know its entirely possible for satanic child sacrificing rapists to be as prevalent as they are.

            <p>
             You shills dont realize you are leaving a digital trace that can be used to track you down if and when we win.  People like me would gladly sign up to be the first through your door to serve some much needed vigilante justice.  If you arent a shill do more research nigger and open your eyes as to the reality of the world

              Do you know what a shill is? In context, a shill is someone acting on behalf of the pedophiles, who happen to be the subject of discourse at
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pg">
               v/pg
              </a>
              . Calling me a shill because I am also concerned about about innocent companies getting caught up in witch hunts does not make me a shill, it qualifies me as someone concerned about injustice, and there are few things as unjust as having your reputation destroyed because someone like you uses very poor judgement.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is a mathematical certainty that there are tens of thousands of perfectly innocent businesses out there right now that somehow use a triangle or spiral in their logo, that they designed in house or had commissioned from a commercial artist. It is also a mathematical certainty that the vast majority of those rendering such logos don't have a flying clue that the pedophile community uses certain spirals or nested triangles to identify one another. In fact, I had no idea until I came across a certain FBI document describing same in one Voat submission some months ago, and I've been on this planet for half a century.

              When you make a submission like yours, you are creating a digital association of this insurance company with pedophilia, one that may exist on the internet until the end of time. Imagine some potential customer wants to learn something about Acadia Insurance because they want to use them. Now this potential customer does a google search and comes across this very submission. Acadia may be as innocent as you, but do you think the potential customer is going to take the time to reason out whether your claim was valid? Or, are they going to automatically go elsewhere and forever hold the thought that Acadia might be run by pedophiles?
