<p>QUESTION:  Who are the other politicos alluded to by his father who have been down the same road of treatment?<br />

<p>They interviewed his father, a democrat activist and attorney, Arthur Schwartz  for this article and have the quotes:</p>
<p>&quot;“Nobody has said one thing to me,” he said. “And I got a lot of positive support — from all over the country. Nobody’s taken any work away from me.”
Some of the politicos who called him to share their sympathies also went a step further, offering suggestions on where to get treatment — because they had previously been down that road themselves, Schwartz added.
“I got tons of calls from people in the political world — AND IT WOULD SHOCK YOU,” he told The Villager. “People who had sexual issues and went into therapy — both in our district and out of our district.”
Schwartz did not divulge any names — except for one, which he firmly stressed was off the record and he did not want published.&quot;</p>
<p>His dad also says that Jacob was running the Build it Back Program, which was under audit.<br />

<p>“He was basically running Build It Back,” Arthur said. “He’s an extremely organized, thorough person. I don’t think he made an enemy in the world. You wouldn’t find a person that had a bad word to say about him — other than this stuff that came out in the press.”</p>
<p>Jacob was caught with a ton of child porn on his computer and he ran a fraudulent million dollar government sanctioned program.   Could it be that the Build it Back program was part of a child porn ring?  Just a thought</p>',

            And isn't Pizzagate supposed to be about Hillary running a child sex slavery ring out of a pizza parlor - an idiotic meme pushed by Hillary herself?!
           </p>
           <p>
            This is big. Very big. This post is the - to borrow the term - nuts and bolts of Pizzagate! I am saving it right now. This is Pizzagate - that opens into global pedo gate. I wonder what names would come up? JB? CS? JM? NP? Just to name a few?

             Schwartz was in charge of that. He was getting paid to run a supposedly beneficial program and was really watching CP. That is not incompetent, that is a gross Felony. So yes, that makes it a fake government program that should be shut down.

            His father is "spinning" the story/sending a message, if you will. Basically saying: "my son needs help from you" and if he doesn't get it, I'll name-names, along with treatment facilities to support my claims. Dad damn well knew, what junior was up to and supported it. Junior was simply  an "early"strategic choice for future prosecution.

             Good point.  I never thought of that, but that would make sense.  His dad came off as really weird about the whole thing.  I would have called him a nutjob, but now he is coming off as slyer than a fox.  You must be pretty smart !
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, I imagine that some of the pics were of pols and the pics were for black mail purposes.  Maybe that is why the dad portrays his son as "not the type" to be into child porn.  The kid was the keeper of the DNC blackmail files.

            To have 3000 images &amp; 69 videos of children performing sex acts with adults on his system, Schwartz is obviously part of a ring. He should be forced to reveal all his contacts or be sentenced to the harshest prison time possible, if he is convicted.
           </p>
           <p>
            We also need to find out who these children are? Are they alive? He has to have contacts in the trade.

            Jacob was caught with a ton of child porn on his computer and he ran a fraudulent million dollar government sanctioned program. Could it be that the Build it Back program was part of a child porn ring? Just a thought***Well, it sure is a definite possibility that should be looked into.

             Imo, they should all be published.  Every year, every pedophile should be listed just to remind people.  In their cities where they did their damage.  If they have to register as sex offenders, that is what they deserve.  Those children they abused never did anything to ask for their vile heinous crimes. I am sure you would approve.

              Yeah I'm a big proponent of the return to public shaming. All drunk drivers mugshots for example should be on billboards for a period of weeks depending on transgression, thus shaming their family and wider community.  Self-policing is the most efficient method of social cohesion, like blood feuds. That's why the Jews  remove all stigmas and impose moral relativism while keeping their own bloodlines strictly bonded as our overlords. 2040 whites will be a minority in the U.S. and inevitably we will descend into violence.

               If you notice, when the police are looking for a killer and a pastor or reverend comes forward, they will say, give yourself up.  The family will plead for them to come forward. The family, many times is somewhat responsible.  They know what is going on, but have their heads in the sand.  They will shame the person if it is in papers, or bill boards.  There must be retribution and this is a good place to start.
