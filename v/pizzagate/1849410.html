<p>From Wikipedia on Charles Taylor:</p>
<p>&quot;Furthermore, Joseph &quot;Zigzag&quot; Marzah, a former military commander, testified that Charles Taylor celebrated his new-found status during the civil war by ordering human sacrifice, including the killings of Taylor\'s opponents and allies that were perceived to have betrayed Taylor, and by having a pregnant woman buried alive in sand.[47] Marzah also accused Taylor of forcing cannibalism on his soldiers in order to terrorize their enemies.[48]&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Taylor_(Liberian_politician)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Taylor_(Liberian_politician)</a></p>
<p>Taylor was an elite of Liberian society and had studied in the 1970\'s at Bentley College in Waltham, Massachusetts. He also fled to the US at another point, was jailed here, and then &quot;escaped&quot; and appeared back in Africa leading militant groups again.</p>
<p>So basically this guy has commonalities with both the American-created foreign terrorist puppet stereotype and is also sacrificing people, ordering people to engage in cannibalism, promoting rape and enslaving people. Just thought it would be worth noting and archiving.</p>',

           Taylor was an elite of Liberian society and had studied in the 1970's at Bentley College in Waltham, Massachusetts. He also fled to the US at another point, was jailed here, and then "escaped" and appeared back in Africa leading militant groups again.

             Yes, that is always the question.  We know he does, they always do.  The question is can we ever get over that hump to get to Real  Evidence.

              Sounds like digging into CF and CGI with any connecting activist groups would be in order.
