           So I did some research, googled the name of a teenage musician who plays for comet ping pong. Only found his vine, however when looking through his vines, I found this video:

           It's an adult male, asking a teenager (who looks either confused/drugged/autistic) "Show me how you fuck" to where the kid proceeds to hump the air. Nothing out of the ordinary, however look in the background, a ping pong table. Also, pay attention to the floor.

           Take a look at this next vine from the same kid:

           One of his latest vines, found here:

           with the title "This is my last vine thanks to anyone whoever saw any of my vines." and if you listen to the lyrics of the song he's listening to, he's clearly depressed.. possibly because of previous child sex abuse?
