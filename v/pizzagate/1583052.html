           Take a look at this next vine from the same kid:

           One of his latest vines, found here:

           with the title "This is my last vine thanks to anyone whoever saw any of my vines." and if you listen to the lyrics of the song he's listening to, he's clearly depressed.. possibly because of previous child sex abuse?
