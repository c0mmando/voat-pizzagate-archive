<p>If you look at the duration, you will see he was there for 11 hours and 58 minutes.</p>
<p>Per this WH Tour Overview &quot;White House tours are conducted from 7:30am – 11:30am on Tuesday to Thursday, as well as 7:30am to 1:30pm on Fridays and Saturdays&quot; As Capone went on a Wed. they would have only had the tour available for 4 hours that day, so how is it he was there for an additional 8 hours and what was he doing and who was he speaking to?</p>
<p>Coincidentally, Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Creamer, was also there that day for same duration. <a href="http://white-house-logs.insidegov.com/l/69986482/Robert-B-Creamer">http://white-house-logs.insidegov.com/l/69986482/Robert-B-Creamer</a>  <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-18/robert-creamer">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-18/robert-creamer</a></p>
<p>Either way...very odd that the man who last saw Seth Rich alive, was just 4 days prior at the WH, exceeding the tour operating hours by an entire work shift.  Also Odd is his appearance on a commercial for Mayor of D.C. Muriel Bowser <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtpgliI8ilw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtpgliI8ilw</a></p>
<p>Also, its interesting to see how sure Capone was over exactly how it was that Seth died. He first says &quot;I heard there were a bunch of robberies lately, by this man with a silver gun.&quot; Then later says &quot;DEFINITELY this guy was trying to rob him, and Seth wasn\'t having it.&quot; <a href="https://crimewatchdaily.com/2016/09/30/exclusive-murdered-dnc-staffers-family-friends-set-record-straight/">https://crimewatchdaily.com/2016/09/30/exclusive-murdered-dnc-staffers-family-friends-set-record-straight/</a>  (Joe Capone segment starts at 5:30 mark)  Odd how the loose official story matches exactly with what Capone putting two and two together that since a man with a silver gun had robbed a couple people per reports, than Seth &quot;Definitely was robbed by him and Seth wasn\'t having it.&quot; Just very odd.  Maybe this was what he was doing at the WH 4 days prior for half the day...trying to get the narrative straight for what was about to soon happen...its not too far fetched to believe that.... or maybe they are right and it was the man with the silver gun who just happened to coincidentally mug the man who had just leaked tens of thousands of emails to wikileaks and decided to shoot him twice, risking murder, and not even bothering to atleast take the 2,000 in cash, his credit cards, watch, or anything else.</p>
<p>The night Seth was at Lous City Pizza a few hours before his death...Capone was putting on UFC200...which is a major major deal for any sports bar. They would all be packed to their limits. How is it that on arguable one of the biggest UFC PP\'v with Brock Lesnar headlining...that not one single person has come out to verify that Seth Rich was there at the bar? Surely out of ALL the people there, someone can recollect seeing Seth. He was a regular at the bar, surely someone would have seen him. Why has no one confirmed it?</p>
<p>Lots of questions need to be answered here.</p>',
