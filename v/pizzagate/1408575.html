            You can let go of the anxiety in your tone, friend.

            "Where I Started Investigating Pedogate" is not "I have proof that this is all happening and these people are all definitely killing babies and cooking them into pizza.
           </p>
           <p>
            I felt it was enough information to start tying people, places, financial entities and financial transactions (which can include art). The web of slime extends across the world and the best way to trace it is to follow the money.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm sorry if you misunderstood me to be conducting any kind of a 'witch hunt.' I'm just following the money.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, if I were to trace Arwen Podesta and her work at Odyssey House to the people involved in the SLC daycare... because Odyssey House does operate in Salt Lake City, then I might steer this conversation in another direction. I would find it strange that money was exchanging hands, children were being helped only to find no children. Wouldn't that be weird?

             Process Church went to Mexico, incorporating Santa Muerta cults which gave rise to the ritual sacrifices within the cartels.

             Eventually, Process Church ends up in New Orleans via the Bahamas. What kind of voodoo do you do?

             hese people all worked to make the Uranium One deal happen. Rosatom, a Russian company, bought Uranium One, a South African company. Frank Giustra, first, acquired mining operations in Khazakstan, under his company, UrAsia, then bought Uranium One, in South Africa, who, then bought assets in the US, like Energy Metals Corporation. Giustra kept the name Uranium One. Ian Telfer was an executive who helped orchestrate a crash in stock price before selling majority share to Rosatom. Sergey Kiriyenko, former Prime Minister in Russia, became CEO in 2007.
