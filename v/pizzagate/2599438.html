<p>Yes, Johnny Depp is connected to Pizzagate. He is connected to the death of River Phoenix who has been suspected of being a victim of the child abusers in Hollywood. He is known to have been violent with the likes of exes Winona Ryder and Amber Heard. He has defended and supported the satanic murderers dubbed by the media as the West Memphis Three. He was also good friends with Hunter S Thompson who has long been thought to have been a paedophile and snuff film maker.</p>',

            Depp is knee deep in occult everything. His close friendship with Marilyn Manson should tell you. The films he made with Tim Burton, although they have some masterful film skills, those films are all very dark and occult in nature.

            There is very good evidence that the "west Memphis three" didnt kill those boys and it was actually one of the stepfathers of one of the boys who did it and they found DNA evidence to back it up... i dont doubt any of the other stuff..

            They are called that because it was the informal name of a group of hard drinkers who used to hangout at an LA nightclub.  They were vampires because they stayed out all night.  Alice Cooper is in this band and used be one of the original drinkers.  I don't think he drinks these days.  He plays golf.

              Normally he’s a dense asshole but Cooper and Perry seem to be more on the traditional/conservative side of politics. Depp is the real train wreck in that band. I don’t see much else suspicious about it. They don’t even do much because Cooper and Perry are both old. Perry collapsed from dehydration during a show a while back.

               Hollywood Vampires (band)
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
              </p>
              <p>
               Hollywood Vampires is an American rock supergroup formed in 2015 by Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp, and Joe Perry to honor the music of the rock stars who died from excess in the 1970s. The band name derives from The Hollywood Vampires, a celebrity drinking club formed by Cooper in the 1970s which included but was not limited to: John Lennon and Ringo Starr of The Beatles, Keith Moon of The Who, and Micky Dolenz of The Monkees.[2]

               The Hollywood Vampires
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
This article is about the celebrity drinking club from the 1970s. For other uses, see Hollywood
              </p>
              <p>
               The Hollywood Vampires was a celebrity drinking club formed by Alice Cooper in the 1970s. The hazing to get into the club was to outdrink all the members.[1] According to Cooper in the documentary Prime Cuts: "The Speakeasy and Tramps were the place to be in London. There was a little loft at the Rainbow Bar and Grill in LA (W. Hollywood), they only had that for the club."[2]
              </p>
              <p>
               In the early 70s, Alice Cooper helmed his own secret late-night drinking club. Based in an exclusive loft at Hollywood’s legendary Rainbow Bar and Grill, it provided boozy sanctuary to many fellow stars including Ringo Starr, John Belushi, John Lennon, Keith Moon, Keith Emerson, Harry Nilsson and Marc Bolan. Their all-night drinking sessions took place away from the prying eyes of the media and nagging managers. The staff at the Rainbow dubbed the crew the Hollywood Vampires.
              </p>
              <p>
               “Because they only saw us at night and all we did was drink!” Cooper laughs down the line from New York. “I remember it, but the lines are a little blurred. Our lines would all get blurred quite a lot. It just seemed to be the place where everybody ended up.”

               You do a good shill job I do admit. But you attempt to be expert at whatever you need to be an expert at. Your fishing technique is Alex Trebek like. Trebek of course, didn't really know shit.

                I don't claim to be expert.  But I am good at reading and researching and spotting bullshit claims.   The specifics of why a claim is bullshit, I might need to research.

               <p>
                and of course, what you call a shill job is just trying to inject some reality, spotting bullshit and bad logic and calling it out.

            , please have a look at our submission rules in the sidebar. We don't allow unsourced discussion posts -- every research post needs links to primary sources supporting every major claim, and posts with zero links are not allowed. We have a separate subverse,
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            , for those. I'm giving you our 24 Hour Grace flair to add links about the band, his connection to River Phoenix, violence toward his exes, defense of the West Memphis Three, and friendship with Thompson. Thanks.
