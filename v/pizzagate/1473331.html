<p>I will be creating a document on google docs (KR2) where people may add any suggestions (that is to say that anyone has view and the ability to use the &quot;suggestions&quot; function on google documents) that are then approved/denied by a moderation staff composed only people I can trust from who reach out to me here (who are granted the editing ability). I will be constantly adding new members and if you have any way to verify who you are and what you\'ve contributed to the discovery and critique of evidence you will be more likely to be added. If you frequently contribute in important and meaningful ways to the suggestions on this document you will more likely be added. 
I will be breaking up people into separate teams to individually investigate specific concepts:
     - A broad section will deal with presenting pieces of evidence (constructive)
     - A broad section will deal with critical fact-checking and general verification (destructive/skepticism)
     - A smaller section will be team leaders in charge of directing and exemplifying the prior two groups
     - A smaller section will need to all individually understand the unity of all the evidence presented in order to come up with general claims and concepts.This is the most time-consuming and specialized branch and I will have only the best people here.</p>
<p>If this holds substantial and irrefutable evidence past the point of my personal doubt, I am willing to come public with my identity and take action on the subject.
If it is proved false, I will officially denounce this \'investigation\' just as the witch trials should have been. 
If it is neither proved one way or another, we will but have to lie dormant as keepers of inconclusive knowledge. Action will be voted upon fairly.</p>
<p>I will say this, and you will not hear it from any of your typical desk-job corporate bosses. No stupid people allowed. That\'s it, you heard that right. In something so serious as this (where a large amount of innocents potentially are getting hurt) I do not want to have to deal with someone who will be but dead weight in what needs to be a very critical and serious project. If you have any concerns over your mental capabilities or if you did not understand what I have just written, do NOT contact me looking to be a position in this.</p>
<p>I\'ll come back with more details later (Friday-Saturday), I hope to hear from your emails and your votes. </p>

            Why should people divert their investigative info to you and trust that you'll curate it and take appropriate action? Voat is an excellent repository of investigative info. Spreading it out to some random person on the internet dilutes our strength.

             And what am I to do with your emails? I am sure NSA and other organizations has your identity as you're not likely hiding behind a vpn or taking any major precautionary measures. I myself am not even trying to hide the fact that I access this content, and establishing a google document DEFINITELY keeps no privacy to the information
            </p>
            <p>
             But I don't believe we should be hiding! This issue needs to come out into the open IF it is real and it needs real people standing there defending it. That is what I am willing to do if this actually gets past a point of reasonable doubt.

               Well to start doing all three at once is incomprehensible. I cannot clearly take a picture of my screen name such that it is visible along with my face by selfie'ing with my phone. Secondly, what would that prove to you? A person, somewhere, is on this account. Great. You're still not exactly making sure that I'm trustworthy are you?
