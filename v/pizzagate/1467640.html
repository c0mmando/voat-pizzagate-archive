<p>After reading this sad story on an adoption agency that pretty much stole this child I looked up the parents who adopted this child. (Melissa and Andy Moore from Boise, Idaho) </p>

This is Andy\'s LinkedIn account and if you scroll down to recommendations you will find he wrote about Rebecca H
who used to work for PersonalShopper.com. &quot;October 29, 2008, Andy managed Rebecca indirectly at PersonalShopper.com&quot;</p>
<p>Who is the CEO of Personalshopper.com?
 LAURA SILSBY!   
</p>
<p>Andy Moore also worked for Hewlett Packard and so did Laura Silsby</p>
<p>Everyone should really think how weird that is. I believe Laura Silsby only had 5 employees and one of them is being recommended by a guy named Andy Moore on LinkedIn who is involved with pretty much stealing a child and now hiding in another state.  Now when you think of Laura Silsby\'s story and kidnapping kids you have to really wonder wtf is going on.</p>
<p>I need help researching this more. Do not post and spam these people we need to gather as much information as possible and see if there is anymore connections we can make.</p>
<p>EDIT: I\'m starting to believe there is potentially a Hewlett Packard Connection we should investigate.</p>

            She also founded a charity called Kids Changing Lives. I've looked through the website and I can't find any information about directors, business addresses or financial reports. It's very sketchy.

            <strong>
             16 deaths
            </strong>
            , according to Dr. Magee, about
            <strong>
             one
            </strong>
            for every

             2000
            </strong>
            cases overseas, which he says is about average. In the last four years, the average has been slightly better, about
            <strong>
             one death in every 3,200 cases.
