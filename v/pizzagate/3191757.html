<p>There\'s a list of coincidences that is worth sharing, I haven\'t verified them, some I\'m sure PG researchers know already.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
TAVISTOCK CLINIC\'S founding father was CLEMENT FREUD\'S GRANDFATHER, Sigmund Freud. CLEMENT FREUD (who is related to self-confessed former Mossad spy Uri Geller) was a prolific paedophile.</li>
<li>
Nick Ross\' father, Hans, had a sister named Dina. Dina become a child psychotherapist at the TAVISTOCK CLINIC (Nick Ross is linked to alleged Savile accomplice and Mossad asset Esther Rantzen. The familial and social circle around Nick Ross also includes his wife Sarah Caplin, Dr Alan Farthing and Sir Cliff Richard, all of whom are alleged collaborators).</li>
<li>
ROLF HARRIS approached the TAVISTOCK CLINIC and the NSPCC in the 1980s with his idea about making a film on child sexual abuse. * </li>
<li>
Esther Rantzen\'s Childwatch donated £15,000 for the film,\'Kids Can Say No\', which was filmed on Hampstead Heath. An NSPCC committee reviewed and approved the film. After \'Kids Can Say No\' the TAVISTOCK CLINIC also helped produce a ROLF HARRIS sequel to it.</li>
<li>
Esther Rantzen went on to develop Childwatch into the Childline charity. In 2006 Dr Carole Easton, who was Childline\'s chief executive at the time, persuaded the NSPCC to absorb Childline into the larger charity. Dr Easton trained as a child and adolescent psychotherapist at the TAVISTOCK CLINIC.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="md-section"></h1>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
The late MP LEO ABSE has been investigated by police in connection with child sexual abuse allegations. His surviving niece, SUSANNA ABSE previously worked for the TAVISTOCK CLINIC as the CEO of Tavistock Relationships.</li>
<li>
The TAVISTOCK CLINIC was originally established in TAVISTOCK SQUARE, the location of the slaughter of 13 bus passengers on 7/7 2005. Margaret Hodge, at the heart of the Islington Child Abuse Scandal, has said that her SISTER was working in TAVISTOCK SQUARE at the time of the explosion.</li>
<li>
CLIFF RICHARD abused children at the Elm Guest House and elsewhere, it has been reported. Sir Cliff once owned a company called Blacknight Limited, an unusual moniker with distinctly occult connotations. Blacknight was registered to an address in TAVISTOCK SQUARE.</li>
<li>
In another extraordinary coincidence, CLIFF RICHARD\'s lawyer, Gideon Benaim, has his office in TAVISTOCK SQUARE. Benaim previously represented the notorious convicted paedophile, Roman Polanski.</li>
<li>
EXARO NEWS, the investigative news website that specialised in reporting on establishment paedophilia, was liquidated by the accountants Menzies LLP (insolvency practitioners Freddy Khalastchi and Jonathan David Bass). Menzies LLP is located in TAVISTOCK SQUARE.</li>
<li>
TAVISTOCK SQUARE was so-named because the estate on which it sits was owned by the Dukes of Bedford from TAVISTOCK, DEVON. In another coincidence, Exaro News\' former owner, DR JEROME BOOTH, grew up in TAVISTOCK, DEVON.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="md-section-1"></h1>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
In an astonishing coincidence, another famous resident of Tavistock Devon is the late Michael Jackson\'s bodyguard, Matt Fiddes. Michael Jackson\'s circle of friends included the late serial child rapist GREVILLE JANNER, as well as the self-confessed former Mossad spy, Uri Geller, who is related to the late paedophile MP, Clement Freud.</li>
<li>
Another famous resident of Tavistock Devon is the Marchioness of Tavistock, Henrietta Russell, who once co-authored a book with spooky Daily Mail journalist and friend of Louis Theroux\'s mother, ANGELA LEVIN. Intriguingly, Angela Levin once also wrote a &quot;fawning&quot; biography on serial paedophile MAX CLIFFORD and  books about Camilla Parker-Bowles and the family of Princess Diana. Moreover, Levin was warned about Jimmy Savile attacking young disabled children, but said nothing.</li>
<li>
Adjoining Tavistock Square is TAVISTOCK PLACE, site of the National Institute of Social Work. The Institute\'s former Director of Education was the notorious convicted paedophile PETER RIGHTON of the PAEDOPHILE INFORMATION EXCHANGE, who in 1979 sat on a steering committee with Janet Mattinson of the TAVISTOCK CENTRE.  Righton was a friend of PIE treasurer Charles Napier; the pair have been linked to the national abuse network.</li>
<li>
PRINCE CHARLES and Princess Diana both received psychiatric services from TAVISTOCK CLINIC trained psychiatrist Dr Alan McGashan. Laurens Van der Post has been identified as the paedophile who introduced Prince Charles to Dr McGashan. Quite incredibly, the prince was treated for 14 years by the Tavistock-trained doctor, according to one historian.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="md-section-2"></h1>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Cicely Meehan, one of the two sisters who helped raise alleged Dolphin Square child trafficker and child rapist DEREK LAUD, was a CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST. Was Cicely Meehan trained by, working for, or in any way connected to the TAVISTOCK CLINIC? Did Cicely Meehan use trauma-based mind control, and/or other methods, to create in Derek Laud a disturbed personality (Dissociative Identity Disorder?) as part of a Tavistock clinical experiment, sponsored by British and Israeli Intelligence, with links to the alleged Savile-Currie-Freuds-Hodges-Vaz-Rantzen-royalty network of VIP child traffickers and paedophiles?</li>
<li>
Dr Valerie Sinason, founder of the Clinic for Dissociative Studies, was Consultant Child Psychotherapist at the TAVISTOCK CLINIC from 1987 to 1999; Consultant Psychotherapist at both the Anna Freud and Portman Clinics from 1994 to 1997; and from 1994 to 2006 a Consultant Research Psychotherapist/Psychoanalyst at St George\'s Hospital Medical School. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="md-section-3"></h1>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Strangely enough, Dr Sinason sits on the Advisory Council of Norwood, the prominent British-Jewish charity to which Jimmy Savile donated his time and talents. Decades treating survivors of child abuse at the TAVISTOCK CLINIC and affiliated institutions has left Dr Sinason in no doubt that children across the UK were sexually abused by a network of VIP paedophiles - the Zionist fixer Jimmy Savile prominent among them - with ritual abuse a not uncommon feature of many of the episodes. </li>
<li>
Dr Sinason does not appear to realise, however, that a faction within her own former institution, the Tavistock Clinic, is itself heavily involved in the design and practice of projects to effect psycho-sexual trauma. (And what does Dr Sinason make of the late Jimmy Savile\'s association with her own \'Norwood\' Jewish charity?)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And even MORE coincidences?</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Peter Parker was a member of the Medical Research Council and the chairman of the London School of Economics (there\'s that university again) from 1988 to 1998
&quot;As chairman of British Rail, it was Parker who brought in Jimmy Savile as the face of British Rail in the ad campaign.</li>
<li>
Parker’s wife Lady Gillian Parker was a founder member of the British False Memory Syndrome Association.&quot;</li>

            A bit of news today, Aaron Dover, who wrote this piece here on Voat.co has been reported as having died by The Times, UK
           </p>
           <p>
            Aaron was a student at the same Christchurch primary school in Hampstead, London that Ella Gareeva's children attended and testified about having been complicit in their abuse. Aaron's mother, Jenny Dover, worked at the school as well as the Tavistock Centre in Hampstead apparently.

            I was a partner in a hedge fund owned by Donald Sussman one of Clinton's main backers in the election and the "godfather of the hedge fund industry". I have vast amounts of information on fraudulent financial markets which are fronts for dollar payments between criminal groups. The figures we are talking about are billions of dollars PER DAY in transactions going through these markets. The markets are operated by the Crown. I need to get in touch with researchers who can use my information. Please can you get in touch if you want to discuss this info. I have plenty of documents proving what I have to say. I was gagged by the High Court of the UK from sharing this info but my current circumstances place me outside their jurisdiction.

             carmencita...........I am a political junkie. ..do a lot of fb posts about it. My instincts have told me that one of my fb friends was super super smart. She stated the vatican controls the world through the city of london. There is very little information about it, even on FB. But, city of london, vatican and DC are all city states or not subject to the laws of the countries they are in. I follow vatican news mainly through Kevin Annette who had the guts to take them on. This was after he found out the catholic church, queen, govt. of Canada and anglican church were responsible for 50% genocide of Native children in canadian  boarding schools . Canadian govt. made a decent apology......pope made a general one. Kevin Annette stated at the beginning of Feb. that pope would lose his job. Well, since the last one had to step down, the current one is one in name only. Kevin says pope's job is to protect the pedaphiles. His third in command , cardinal pell is going to prison for pedaphilia. Pell was in charge of treasury AND laundering money for the mafia. ..hence a big money source.Have looked for mafia not having back up in regular news and have seen some enormous drug busts. City of London, queen has no jurisdiction over it. Barclays , which was the instigator in the Libor scandal recently had a big fire...supposedly from an air conditioner. Never really understood the Libor scandal but it was so significant in fixing interest rates that the city of Oakland , California was seriously thinking of not repaying municipal debt. They shut that down in the news pronto. But that whole thing reminded me of when dick cheney was going to be investigated at his office...a moving van was outside and smoke was rising from the roof. Dick was on a little balcony. US MSM did not comment on the weirdness of the scene. Another big deal, Trump signed an executive order stating that sex traffickers can have all assets confiscated. Since then, rothschildren have gotten out of the lending business, i.e . central banking. and sold off the family compound in UK. David rockefella died and his belongings were auctioned off as well as rothschildren. I wonder if they are in a big hurry so they can hide their assets in Swiss banks  etc as they know there is a new sheriff in town. Switzerland has told their people to prepare for war. Swiss guard protect pope. All seem to be connected like a snake pit.

              The mods here had delted my post on Kevin Annette and other times allowed it but called it possible disinfo. Despite the fact that he has the support of all the vitims who can be seen authnticating what he says, the gatekeepers here are quick to say not to listen to him. Vindcator is the chief culprit. The Vatican is controlled by the British Crown and Rothschild is above them both, they own it all. British crown rules our courts. All three co- 0wn the prvate IRS. When you pay income tax, it goes to them, not our defacto government USA INC.. At least that is how I understand it. Doesn't matter the pecking order really, they are all partners in crime.

              I also check in on Kevin A on and off.  The pope has an army and it is filled with Swiss Guards.  They have special weapons.  I read about it on here once.  Frightening.  Yes, I remember the Dick C incident.  The Indigenous Genocide of Children in Canada is beyond sinful and grotesque.  I am hoping this is winding down.  I remember reading about David R.  as well.  Hopefully they are all shaking in their boots.  They should be.   RIP Aaron Dover +

               Switzerland was formed by the Templars, Jeuits are a branch of the Templars trusted to infiltrate the Catholic church. Of course the Swiss are involved. Switzerland chose the crosss as their Symbol, when the New World order Templars stole the wealth of the Middle East, the returned to Europe and formed Switzerland and became the finannciers. The Swiss cross is a representation of the Templars cross. You can also find the Templars cross on early versions of German tanks during the Poland campaign during ww2, they changed it to the Iron cross likely because it was too obvious. Of course the Pope has Swiss gaurds at his city state of Rome.

                Yes I have read about the Jesuits and Francis has definitely been inserted to kill off the Catholic Church.  He seems to be doing a good job of it.  The flock of sleepy sheep are comatose.  Some faithfuls are fighting back but we shall see.  Poland and Hungary also are fighting. These are scary times, but we have had them before.  Let's hope we can beat this Infidel Bergoglio.  The new Italian heads are not playing ball either.
