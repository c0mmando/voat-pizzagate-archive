            I believe that the world is comming back to the optimism of the JFK days. History will see the last 60 years as a glitch, another failed attempt to create a global dictatorship. Ironically their tools of control and their globalisation got used against them. The Elites from that generation are passing most of their legacy will be forgotten.

            JFK was an interesting guy, probably one of the few good ones, maybe the last in the White House. He was actually from a family that was one of the 13 bloodlines, so he was part of the cabal. But once he was put in power, it seems he didn't want to be in lock step with all the twisted agendas. Just before being murdered, he spoke of abolishing the Federal Reserve and splintering the CIA into 1000 pieces. He also referred to an evil element that wanted to do harm to humanity. Not hard to figure out why he was eliminated.  Bush SR. is suspected to be the CIA OP that organized his assasination. Russ Baker has exposed Bush on this subject as dishonest regarding his whereabouts and said he couldn't remember what he was doing or where he was. I was not alive duriing this event, but once I went over the evidence I was stunned that their was any confusion about who was the top suspect. The secret service wiped down the blood spatter on his car before it could be investigated and the CIA seized his brain from doctors. When it was requested to be returned so an autopsy could be perfomed, the CIA said it was missing/lost/stolen...Yeah ok. Inside job.

            JFK would be a conservative Republican in 2017.  He was my hero in 1960 when I was just a wee 12 year old.

             Not likely as JFK proclaimed his liberalism and stood against right wing and secrecy and right now
we have nothing but secret government.
            </p>
            <p>
             JFK was ever mindful of the environment and the right wing and "conservatives" in GOP are
completely dedicated to denial of Global Warming and even attempting to dismantle 
Environmental Protection Agency.
            </p>
            <p>
             JFK was also seeking peace with Russia and I know no one in either party who is 
doing anything but trying to resurrect a Cold War with Russia.
            </p>
            <p>
             PLUS JFK was limiting nuclear testing and stocking piling of nuclear weapons.
            </p>
            <p>
             JFK understood "Acid Rain" pouring down on us and the danger to the next generations.
(ON EDIT ... presumably nuclear fallout as a pollutant could be described as "Acid Rain" but 
what JFK was actually talking about was the need to limit nuclear testing and how the fallout 
from nuclear testing returned to the earth - and the answer is via rainfall.)
            </p>
            <p>
             JFK would have also stood against the economics of the GOP and their "conservatives" as
he was seeking to wipe out the Depletion Allowance on oil.
            </p>
            <p>
             JFK was a liberal and would still be.

              Interesting points.  However the EPA was started by Nixon in 1970, 7 years after JFK's  death.  Growing up in the 50's and 60's, there were no discussions invoving "acid rain" or global warming.  JFK did very little for equal rights to keep his southern Democrats happy.

               True Nixon created the EPA but as a result of growing public concerns for the environment.
The Global Warming model had been introduced to the public in 1957.

                What JFK was questioning was fallout from nuclear bombs 
dropped on Japan and from nuclear tests of bombs which were being widely carried out.
                <br/>
                And he was correct in his assumption that the fallout returns to earth in our rain.

              <p>
               And JFK was very concerned about nuclear bomb testing and the after effects and impact on humanity
and all of Nature.  You will find that information in books and records of JFK's administration.
And in the fact that he did all he could to LIMIT nuclear testing and the build up of weaponry - and to 
make the Cold War laughable.

               <p>
                Nuclear fallout, or simply fallout, is the residual radioactive material propelled into the upper atmosphere following a nuclear blast, so called because it "falls out" of the sky after the explosion and the shock wave have passed.[1] It commonly refers to the radioactive dust and ash created when a nuclear weapon explodes. Fallout may get entrained with the products of a pyrocumulus cloud and fall as black rain[2] (rain darkened by soot and other particulates).
               </p>
               <p>
                This radioactive dust, usually consisting of fission products mixed with bystanding atoms that are neutron activated by exposure, is a highly dangerous kind of radioactive contamination.

               "Acid rain" is something very specific to pollution when any type of fuel is burned.
Precipitation with acidic components.  Smoke from cars and factories.

                Re Civil Rights Legislation and JFK Administration ....
               </strong>
               The legislation on Civil Rights which LBJ did eventually get passed was based in the work of President
Kennedy and the JFK administration and most particularly in efforts made by JFK, including what was a very purposeful campaign in speeches made by JFK, his appeal to the American public, and to unions.*
              </p>
              <p>
               This was a continuing campaign which JFK was very personally involved with to create positive change for African Americans in our society.

               <p>
                Although the office of the presidency holds considerable power, the president alone cannot fulfill his agenda without significant support from the legislative branch of government and the American people. When President Kennedy proposed civil rights legislation in 1963, he faced substantial opposition in Congress and from a large segment of Americans.  In this lesson plan, students will consider how a president can generate support for one of his legislative initiatives and help a bill become a law, by investigating the steps President Kennedy took in attempting to turn his June 1963 civil rights proposal into meaningful legislation.

                Nixon is a hero for being anticommunist and hitting women was the norm in his time and Sean Connery did it in every film, so I'll give him a pass.

                Left Right paradigm is about following nature or believing in a man-made IDEOLOGY.
               </p>
               <p>
                Nature is intuitive so therefore EVERYTHING ELSE IS IDEOLOGY and that is what the great Pat Buchanan taught me.

                This is why they devise terms like "racist" to begin with -- to create an alternative source of perspective supposedly corrupted by society's "racism" and make you second guess your god-given instincts and intuition.

Is it on YouTube?

                Well I remember once you told me you were pretty well versed on all this but it is still worth watching, a lot of good historical stuff and hard to find clips and interviews. Professionally done. It's the best redpill piece for people who are still on the fence cause it implies rather than beats you over the head. If it's not on youutbe you can purchase it for a few bucks, well worth it. Amazon or Vimeo. Very well done, Morgan Freeman narrates. Edit: Look at the trailer on youtube.

             Certainly, LBJ was the mastermind, along with Allen Dulles/CIA and military.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to Madelaine Brown, the assassination was set in a deal made between
Joseph Kennedy and H. L. Hunt that LBJ would go as VP.
            </p>
            <p>
             Two years of planning for the assassination followed.
            </p>
            <p>
             And John Connolly was certainly involved.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's a list of those who arrived at Clinton Murchinson's on the evening before the 
assassination of JFK -- 
Besides Madelaine Brown who had been at an earlier affair at the Murchinson home
that day, the journalist Helen Thomas was also there and is said to have filed an 
Affidavit the morning after the assassination listing the names of the men who had
the private meeting at the Murchinson's.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not entirely a complete list and probably some spelling errors ...
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course, there would have been others below these involved -- 
and H. L. Hunt and Allen Dulles weren't at the meeting ...

              Very good. You should befriend some of these people on facebook, it's fun, Judyth Vary Baker and many others. I was talking to Chauncey Holt's daughter recently, he was CIA, one of the three tramps. James Files people. John Barbour the guy who did "The Garrison Tapes." Etc.

               Very much admire Judyth Vary Baker, so that may bring me in.
Last I saw of her in an appearance she was still having to be very careful and was kind of in hiding.

               Also have long admired Jim Garrison and have read most of his books.
We keep hearing how "complicated" the assassination was, but it was really very simple
and certainly LBJ, MIC and CIA were involved.
Chauncey Holt appeared out of nowhere as I recall and kind of reminds me of "Doug 'n Dave" of Crop 
Circle fame and think they were paid to lie.

             Thank you for this. Upvoat.We watched the funeral on our black and white TV for days. Schools were closed.  Many did not go to work. This is one of my very favorite speeches.  I heard it a few years ago and then someone posted the link on here.  My husband and I both watched it and it made me cry.  Cry for what we lost and for what we would have had.  Possibly we would not be fighting what we are today.  But they could not let him live. THEY had too much to lose as well. .......into .a thousand pieces and scatter it into the wind.
