<p>Article:  <strong>&quot;Exclusive: Inside Chappaqua\'s drug, sex abuse scandal&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The 15-year-old Horace Greeley High School student was flubbing his lines for the school musical, so his drama teacher called him into his office and closed the door.</p>
<p>There, the boy\'s parents said, Christopher Schraufnagel gave their son his first dose of cocaine.</p>
<p>It was the start of a downward spiral that the student and his parents — one of five Chappaqua families who have filed civil claims against Schraufnagel and the Chappaqua school district — blame on the 41-year-old veteran speech and drama teacher</p>

<li><strong>The school district\'s lawyer blamed the underage students for the damage caused to them:</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Editorial:  <strong>&quot;Schraufnagel - A dark case study&quot;</strong></p>
<p>First, the district argued in legal papers that any harm suffered by student plaintiffs was caused by the students\' own &quot;carelessness, recklessness, negligence and/or assumption of the risk.&quot; Then, in motions filed in two of the cases, a district lawyer argued that the names of plaintiff parents should be made public. The parents have sought anonymity to protect the identities of their children, the alleged victims.</p>

            Thanks for this. I think it is time we start investigating the individuals in these PR firms. And attorneys. What are their alliances? And it is sad ... depressing and sad that our kids are being sold out to these depraved individuals.

             Public HS vs Public HS in one of the wealthiest counties in America. Check places like Greenwich CT, New Canaan CT. The old money power elite are in the North east so you can imagine what their "public schools" are like. Judge Judy has a 50 million$  house in Greenwich.Quite a different world.

             , same question I asked when I found out that in our district we have 4th grade teachers raking in about 85k a year. And get this... here they are making more than most in one year what it takes teachers elsewhere to make in 3 or 4, yet they'll occasionally go on strike for more. My daughters 3rd grade teacher retired 8 or so years ago at 120k a year and her pensions about 90% of it. Oh and the best part is how just yesterday my daughter comes home complaining about her art class, saying "creativity isn't allowed." Go figure!!
