<p>The Complete Guide to Monica Petersen\'s mysterious death in Haiti last week (self.The_Donald) submitted 14 hours ago * by rutkdn Monica Petersen died in Haiti on November 13th. She was previously a research intern at the Laboratory to Combat Human Trafficking (LCHT) and also was a Research Fellow and Assistant Director at the Human Trafficking Center (HTC). She also served on the Colorado Human Trafficking Council\'s Data &amp; Research Task Force. Both LCHT and HTC announced her passing on Facebook: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RI4wyxe.png">http://i.imgur.com/RI4wyxe.png</a> <a href="http://i.imgur.com/YDCdlqS.png">http://i.imgur.com/YDCdlqS.png</a> It was not immediately clear under what circumstances she died, and this remains so to this day. As of today, Nov. 22nd, the family has not received Monica\'s body. Although the family held a Memorial Service on Friday, Nov. 18th, there was no proper funeral/burial for Monica. The family is relying on information coming out Haiti and has not had the chance to conduct a proper autopsy in the US. Friends of Monica have made mentions and suggestions that they are in the dark as far as finding out what happened, and some alluded to Monica\'s death being considered a suicide, while others say she was murdered: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/MvuVCry.png">http://i.imgur.com/MvuVCry.png</a> <a href="http://i.imgur.com/T6XSDjN.png">http://i.imgur.com/T6XSDjN.png</a> <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KI7L3Fx.png">http://i.imgur.com/KI7L3Fx.png</a> Monica goes to Haiti On August 15, 2015, Monica announced her plan to visit Haiti to conduct research on human trafficking: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/HuWndZc.png">http://i.imgur.com/HuWndZc.png</a> And she has lived there since: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/N4yeb1V.png">http://i.imgur.com/N4yeb1V.png</a> After several weeks, Monica discovers corruption in Haiti involving the Clintons and people/entities related to them, and focuses her research on Hillary Clinton from that moment on: On January 3rd, 2016, Monica shared with her friend Bella some of her findings based on her field work in Haiti up to that point. By this time she had already become aware of corruption by the Clintons in Haiti (&quot;starts to connect the dots on what I already suspected&quot;). In fact, she was getting ready to dive full time: &quot;Ms. Clinton has corrupt &amp; dirty business to finish in Haiti ... This is the theory my master\'s thesis puts forth... this is modern structural slavery&quot;. Bella re-shared this post by Monica to a Facebook group she belonged to: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/f2j3QME.png">http://i.imgur.com/f2j3QME.png</a> In that same post, Monica also links to this blog post discussing similar claims: <a href="http://thehaitianblogger.blogspot.com/2015/03/hillary-clintons-scandalous-conduct-in.html">http://thehaitianblogger.blogspot.com/2015/03/hillary-clintons-scandalous-conduct-in.html</a> The day after, on January 4th, 2016, Monica again shared with her friend Bella some more of her findings: &quot;But the real significance of this scandal for me, I know you feel me Bella, is the link to contemporary slavery and trafficking.

They claim now that Bella is seeking fame, yet the exact opposite is true - Bella is trying to distance herself as much as possible from all this. Those 3 people seem very adamant in conveying the fact that they know for a fact Monica\'s death is not related to her research activity in Haiti. Yet, at the same time, admit that the family has NOT EVEN SEEN Monica\'s body.

           After several weeks, Monica discovers corruption in Haiti involving the Clintons and people/entities related to them, and focuses her research on Hillary Clinton from that moment on: On January 3rd, 2016, Monica shared with her friend Bella some of her findings based on her field work in Haiti up to that point. By this time she had already become aware of corruption by the Clintons in Haiti ("starts to connect the dots on what I already suspected"). In fact, she was getting ready to dive full time: "Ms. Clinton has corrupt &amp; dirty business to finish in Haiti ... This is the theory my master's thesis puts forth... this is modern structural slavery". Bella re-shared this post by Monica to a Facebook group she belonged to:

            http://i.imgur.com/f2j3QME.png
           </a>
           In that same post, Monica also links to this blog post discussing similar claims:
           <a href="https://thehaitianblogger.blogspot.com/2015/03/hillary-clintons-scandalous-conduct-in.html">
            http://thehaitianblogger.blogspot.com/2015/03/hillary-clintons-scandalous-conduct-in.html
           </a>
           The day after, on January 4th, 2016, Monica again shared with her friend Bella some more of her findings: "But the real significance of this scandal for me, I know you feel me Bella, is the link to contemporary slavery and trafficking. I can't say to what extent, but there is human trafficking happening through the Clinton's Caraol Complex.":

           </a>
           Monica has been researching human trafficking for a long time. She wrote this blog post in 2014: Root Causes and Contradictions of the Displaced Youth along the U.S./Mexico Border:
           <a href="https://archive.is/M3cTp">
            https://archive.is/M3cTp
           </a>
           She testified along with Prof. Claude d’Estree in front of the Colorado-Senate Committee on human trafficking matters:
           <a href="http://archive.is/s4opv">
            http://archive.is/s4opv
           </a>
           She gave presentations in the field of human trafficking:
           <a href="http://i.imgur.com/BFoD79c.png">
            http://i.imgur.com/BFoD79c.png
           </a>
           Prof. Claude d’Estree's comments Monica's memorial service was streamed live on Nov. 18th and covered live here:
           <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5dowzr/new_info_monica_petersen_died_mysteriously_in/">
            https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5dowzr/new_info_monica_petersen_died_mysteriously_in/
           </a>
           Her boss/professor Claude d'Estree said (beginning 39:30 mark of the stream): "(She) decided to take on one of the demagogues in the field of human trafficking." "Produced a 110-page analysis of human trafficking in Haiti - 2 years of research." "We were looking for someone who was smart enough and maybe brave enough to publish her work" "I will continue to seek out and publish it for her" "We are in a state of shock. We may never know what exactly happened to her" Also, I am not suggesting anything, but for the sake of completeness, I should mention that Claude d'Estree worked in the US Attorney's office on behalf of DynCorp between 1999-2002:

           Aftermath I have been contacted by 3 different people all claiming to be good friends with Monica with the sole purpose of trying to discredit the link to the Clintons. They mostly did so by attacking Bella, while ignoring the fact that she simply shared these posts 10 MONTHS AGO with no agenda other than to spread the word to her friends in a small Facebook group. They claim now that Bella is seeking fame, yet the exact opposite is true - Bella is trying to distance herself as much as possible from all this. Those 3 people seem very adamant in conveying the fact that they know for a fact Monica's death is not related to her research activity in Haiti. Yet, at the same time, admit that the family has NOT EVEN SEEN Monica's body. Original thread here with lots of discussion here:

            Can you get proofs for the emails Monica sent to Bella and any other material? I mean proofs that Monica sent them etc? Getting her papers or files would be good too, but if a book comes out about her that whitewashes the Clintons, the email proofs would help discredit the book (esp. if the author can be linked as supporters of Clintons).

            Thank you. Is there still no cause of death?

            What an interesting coincidence that everyone who investigates the Clintons dies mysteriously. This is some House of Cards level shit.

            Edit: I can't view the video from the memorial service. It looks like it's been deleted. Is there a mirror anywhere?

            I think MP started to follow the aid to Haiti since not much appeared to get accomplished. With her human trafficking knowledge in Haiti, she easily could have found kickbacks. It's been said that a lot of aid money ended up with officials and back to donors pockets via backroom deals. Money, power and pedos seem to go hand in hand. I was trying to make a connection between raping of natural resources and children/disadvantaged by giving funding, such as HRC brother and gold mine, state department intervention over "orphans" heading to DR. While trying to follow the money through Haiti, looking for oddities and started to hit walls. This article cleared up some of my questions:

            Between Gates, Clintons, UN World Food Program and USAid, there is a sh*t load of money and supposed supplies being poured into countries. It really makes me think puppet governments with major kickbacks.

            Looking at Gates Foundation 990 taxes for 2014, 20+ million went to Clinton 501c3s. Page 43.

            `How is it that a young healthy woman can die in Haiti and we can't even get a cause of death?   Wouldn't there have to be a police report with the evidence that it was a suicide?   They must have some rule of law there, since they caught Silsby trying to sneak over the border with children twice.

            We should probably keep an eye on Monica's friends (the real ones) in case they accidentally fall out of a window or something, you know. Also, I've noticed that Colorado has came up a few times; is there anything different about Colorado when it comes to trafficking?
