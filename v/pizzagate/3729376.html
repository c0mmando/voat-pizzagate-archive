<blockquote>
<p>ALEFANTIS: Yeah, it’s crazy. Actually, David Tanis was my most nerve-wracking, because he’s one of my chef heroes. His cookbooks are so important to me, and his column in the New York Times is so important to me. I read it every week, we think about it, it becomes part of our vernacular. Alice is honestly my friend now, because I’ve known her for years. Every time she comes to town, she always comes here.</p>
<p>Waters, and in some ways Gabrielle Hamilton [chef/owner of Prune in New York], were kind of the inspiration for a restaurant like this to exist. You have a real commitment to the seasons, a real commitment to the farmers, a real commitment to the community. And it’s really independent. Alice only owns one restaurant, you know what I mean? But when she talks about it, she’s like, “I’m creating a revolution.” The revolution is everything: how people eat, where your food comes from, who is respected in your community. She was like a mentor to me.</p>

<p>In 2013, a Disney-Partnered Movie Executive named Bill (William) Haney shot a documentary about Alice </p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130702110210/https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2013/06/27/film-making-a-passion-for-blu-homes-bill-haney/">https://web.archive.org/web/20130702110210/https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2013/06/27/film-making-a-passion-for-blu-homes-bill-haney/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bill Haney, chief executive of startup Blu Homes, is in Berkeley, Calif., this week shooting a documentary, with the help of his three children, about Alice Waters, executive chef and owner of restaurant Chez Panisse. For Mr. Haney, writing, directing and producing films has facilitated his entrepreneurial life.</p>
<p>In 2000, Mr. Haney co-founded film production company Uncommon Productions, together with his friend from their undergrad years at Harvard University, Tim Disney, great nephew of Walt Disney DIS -0.11%. The pair went on to make 15 movies together.</p>
<p>In 2007, Mr. Haney decided to launch a startup focused on building airy pre-fabricated houses with eco-friendly features. That meant less focus on Uncommon Productions.</p>
<p>“When I told [Tim Disney] I will spend less time making movies, he asked to be involved [in Blu Homes],” said Mr. Haney.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After Blu Homes ousted Haney as CEO, he went on to found Dragonfly Therapeutics </p>

<blockquote>
<p>After soliciting well over $100 million in funding to launch and expand Blu Homes into a national builder and open a factory, Bill Haney resigned as CEO recently amid the total downsizing of Blu only to pop up getting $33 Million in funding to launch Dragonfly, a new medical drug company.</p>

<p>Dragonfly is trying to do that by focusing on natural killer (NK) cells, which help the body battle viruses, parasites, and tumors, and alert other immune cells of threats. NK cells are members of the innate immune system, the body’s initial defense against foreign invaders.</p>

<p>Natural Killer cells are derived from fetal tissue  and placenta (afterbirth). They are then mixed with MSC\'s (mesenchymal stem cells) derived from bone marrow</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The interaction between human NK cells and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) has been recently reported by us and others [15,16,17,18,19]. MSCs are multipotent, adult stem/stromal cells and with the ability of self-renewal and differentiation into the three mesenchymal lineages of adipocyte, osteocyte, and chondrocyte [20,21,22,23]. MSCs can be isolated from various adult tissues, such as human placenta [20,21,22,23]. We recently reported that the interaction between NK cells and MSCs from the maternal side of human placenta known as decidua parietalis (DPMSCs) results in the lysis of DPMSCs [19]. Similarly, NK cells can also lyse human bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMMSCs) [15,16,17,18].</p>
<p>Previously, we isolated MSCs from the fetal part of human term placenta known as chorionic villi [23]. These placental MSCs (pMSCs) have immunosuppressive properties [23,24,25]. pMSCs induce the differentiation of anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2 macrophages) from human monocytes [25] and exert inhibitory effects on the functions of human dendritic and T cells [26]. Thus, pMSCs can control the functions of immune cells that mediate both the innate and adaptive immune responses. These properties make pMSCs attractive candidates for cell-based therapy.</p>
<p>The principle for the successful use of pMSCs as a cell-based therapy is to have a full description of their interaction with a wide range of immune cells. Currently, the consequences of the interaction between pMSCs and human NK cells are unknown. Therefore, we conducted this study to investigate the interactions between pMSCs and NK cells and the outcomes of this interaction. We found that pMSCs inhibit the proliferation of both resting non-activated NK cells (NK cells induced to proliferate by IL-2) and activated NK cells (NK cells pre-activated by IL-2). We also found that IL-2-activated NK cells produce a strong cytolytic response against pMSCs and that this response might involve the activating NK cell receptor CD69. pMSCs did not alter NK cell cytolytic activity against cancer cells; however, most important was that pMSCs induced NK cell expression of several molecules with anti-tumor properties.</p>
