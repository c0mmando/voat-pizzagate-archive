<p>Investigators are working to trace a total of 426 grooming gang members who abused an estimated 1,500 victims in Rotherham.</p>
<p>The National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation into sexual exploitation between 1997 and 2013 has so far resulted in 13 convictions, as prosecutions continue.</p>
<p>The operation, codenamed Stovewood, could cost £90m if the government continues its current funding until 2024.</p>

The NCA has so far identified 151 “designated suspects”, and has listed 275 others who it has not been able to name. It is currently running 22 separate investigations under Operation Stovewood, with around 290 victims engaging with officers. </p>
<p>Described as “unprecedented in its scale and complexity” because of the vulnerability of victims and witnesses recalling abuse dating back up to 20 years, a spokesperson for the investigation said 24 suspects have so far been charged and 12 have been arrested and bailed, or released under investigation.</p>

            Today, four men of the Huddersfield Muslim child rape gang
            <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1039976/latest-news-uk-child-sex-abuse-gang-jailed-36-years">
             got sentenced
            </a>
            :
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Judge Phillips told the court (...): "It is likely that all of these girls will never recover from the abuse they suffered."
            </p>
            <p>
             The gang was spearheaded by ringleader Amere Singh Dhaliwal, 36, of Huddersfield, who received a life sentence in June with a minimum term of 18 years, for 22 rapes involving 11 girls.
            </p>
            <p>
             Akram was jailed for 17 years for trafficking for sexual exploitation and rape and Ahmed received five years for sexual assault and inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ibrar received three years for trafficking for sexual exploitation and actual bodily harm and Bashir was sentenced to 11 years for rape and attempted rape.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            It remains to be seen how much time they will actually have to spend in prison. I don't hold my breath.

            Does anyone feel left out?
           </p>
           <p>
            These child raping Muslims in UK, they each and everyone of them, need to be castrated and have their fingers and toes cut off and their tongues pullled out (it hurts more) and their noses cut off as well (lets make sure they cant do anything to anynoe ever again.. and let them live long years of souffrance in that state, they deserve as much damage done to them as they did to their victims.)
            <br/>
            However.. all of the othe pedophiles need to get the same treatement.  The Catholic ones, the jewish the buddidsts, the new age religions.. holy crap those ones even promote pedophilia as a life choice for fucks sake!!
All of them.. tongueless, fingerless, dick or vagina less. (yes..there are female pedophiles as well, just cut it all out from the cocsis to the naval, make sure they feel nothing ever again as relating to sexual satisfaction in their lifetime again, and may it be a long and miserable life)

             Am I correct though in observing that most cultures pedophiles predate upon their own most easily available children,  whereas the 'diversity ' offered by these Sunni muslims is that they deliberately target children of other creeds as ' unbelievers'and therefore deserving of their fates?

              Hey Moloch - Pedophiles ALWAYS prey on the most easily available children.  ALWAYS.  What needs to be addressed in this case is WHY THE FUCK did these guys HAVE ACCESS to so many victims?  Why didnt anybody say something and why did the police do nothing?  Who is complicit in the local councils and mosques and schools?  Otherwise its just going to be turned into "boo them" propoganda.. (and the victims get forgotten in a flurry of internet shitcalling).

              (you really have to ask yourself, WHY isnt anyone sdaying anything?  Where are the feminists?  (all scared of being called racists?)
If you refer to Mohammed Shafiq's statements, you'll see that most of the grooming groups (and there are many) in UK targeet white girls because their OWN SOCIAL LAWS refuse that they have extra marital sex with Pakistani girls in their own close knit secular communities.

              In this particulier case of those muslim guys preying on those english girls, you'd be correct in associating the fact that the girls were non muslim that the rapists felt authoried to rape the girls.   However.. that's just a basic tenant of zionism, you're the best, everyone else is your slave/product/cum dumpster if you so desire it.  It isnt a concept (me great, you shit) that's unique to Sunnism (for the record Im not muslim, Im not championning anything, nor anyone, Im roman catholic and disgusted to be so)  Throughout history all religious creeds boiled down to us right, them wrong.
              <br/>
              But you musnt generalise that particular case to Muslims wanting to rape non muslim children all the time...  Muslims abuse muslim children as well. And it's legal.  Its called child brides..

               Remember the the video of the policeman who was from Minnesota and worked with NY police on pedophelia .........he said kids were picked up at juice bars and schools etc., the parents never said anything. I found that odd.

            Unfortunately for the decent Muslims there, the culture followed. Nothing different from any other migrating culture, except for who let the bad ones in. Jews kill other jews all the time. Mexicans too. It is tribal folks.

            Some background info from a Wikipedia article about the Rotherham child rape gangs:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Evidence of the abuse was first noted in the early 1990s, when care home managers investigated reports that children in their care were being picked up by taxi drivers.
            </p>
            <p>
             From at least 2001, multiple reports passed names of alleged perpetrators, several from one family, to the police and Rotherham Council. The first group conviction took place in 2010, when five British-Pakistani men were convicted of sexual offences against girls aged 12–16.
            </p>
            <p>
             From January 2011 Andrew Norfolk of The Times pressed the issue, reporting in 2012 that the abuse in the town was widespread,
             <strong>
              and that the police and council had known about it for over ten years.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             The Times articles, along with the 2012 trial of the Rochdale child sex abuse ring, prompted the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee to conduct hearings. Following this and further articles from Norfolk, Rotherham Council commissioned an independent inquiry led by Professor Alexis Jay.
             <strong>
              In August 2014 the Jay report concluded that an estimated 1,400 children, most of them white girls,had been sexually abused in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013 by predominantly British-Pakistani men.
             </strong>
             [But recent reports said that the number is 1,500+ victims.]
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Trigger warning
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             The abuse included gang rape, forcing children to watch rape, dousing them with petrol and threatening to set them on fire, threatening to rape their mothers and younger sisters, and trafficking them to other towns.

             The failure to address the abuse was attributed to a combination of factors revolving around race, class and gender—contemptuous and sexist attitudes toward the mostly working-class victims; fear that the perpetrators' ethnicity would trigger allegations of racism and damage community relations; the Labour council's reluctance to challenge a Labour-voting ethnic minority; lack of a child-centred focus; a desire to protect the town's reputation; and lack of training and resources.

            <p>
             'A new report by Quilliam International has found an alarming level of over-representation of (South) Asian men in group-based child sexual exploitation crimes, otherwise known as ‘grooming gangs’.
            </p>
            <p>
             'Both authors, CEO Haras Rafiq and Researcher Muna Adil, are of British Pakistani heritage and, in light of recent events, deemed it necessary for a strong voice from within the community to add a balanced and evidence-based view to the discussion surrounding grooming gangs.
            </p>
            <p>
             Haras Rafiq said:
            </p>
            <p>
             ''We didn’t want there to be a pattern of people from our ethnic demographic carrying out these attacks. But unfortunately, we were proven wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
             Muna Adil said:
            </p>
            <p>
             “There are elements from within the British Pakistani community that still subscribe to outdated and sexist views of women embedded within their jaded interpretations of Islam.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              These backward views are passed down from generation to generation.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             The report consists of a comprehensive data analysis of grooming gang cases identified in the UK since 2005. Ten case studies from 2010-2017 are also analysed in depth to help determine any similarities and identify any patterns that exist across the cases.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most of these men are of Pakistani (Muslim) origin, and the majority of their victims are young, white girls. The report suggests that the background of these men has influenced their actions.
            </p>
            <p>
             The report found that 84% of ‘grooming gang’ offenders were (South) Asian, while they only make up 7% of total UK population and that the majority of these offenders are of Pakistani origin with Muslim heritage.
            </p>
            <p>
             The report later goes on to discuss and analyse these cultural and religious contexts in order to explain why this demographic features so prominently in this specific crime. The report concludes with a number of recommendations that we hope will begin the process of working towards resolutions.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is the hope of the authors that this report sparks much-needed dialogue that is nuanced and evidence-based, and replaces the reactionary attitudes that currently plague the public sphere regarding any issues that directly or indirectly involve minorities'.

             they need a tweak on their stats, there. 84% of offenders, but 7% is the overall Asian population - halve that for men, weed out the Sihks and Hindus, exlude those under 15 and over, say 60, and you probably have a 84% / 2% comparison

              At the same time, Sarah Champion, the MP for Rotherham,
              <a href="http://archive.fo/4ZZw6">
               has voiced her concern
              </a>
              that the number of of perps receiving custodial sentences has dropped:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               [She] has expressed concern the number of people receiving custodial sentences for child sexual abuse (CSA) has fallen despite such crimes continuing to happen on a "massive scale".
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Rotherham MP Sarah Champion (pictured) said fewer cases are being passed on to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and police "cannot cope" with the volume of offences.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Ms Champion said figures she obtained from the Ministry of Justice show the number of CSA offenders receiving a custodial sentence at crown court dropped 4.7% in 2017 - the first decline since 2013.

              Thanks for the link. Please see my edited comment above. I will submit it as a seperate post now, so users will be able to read it together with your post.

              Yes, I think that public pressure has led to some results. Sadly, we will need to keep the pressure up. I was actually shocked when I read the number of 'sexual exploitation cases' in Bradford, Yorkshire - Bradford is a rather small town, like Telford, and they had more than 1,000 in a short period of time. :-/

              , was it you who did a post some months ago where all convictions of child rape gang members were listed? Looking for that post, thought I'd ask you before searching your submission history. ;-)

              Thanks.
