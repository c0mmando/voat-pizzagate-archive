            when things around are slow, why not look into anything even remotely related? the truth is we dont know the extent of whats connected and what isn't.

a pizza that's sure to weigh more than a ton,
a pizza too massive to pick up and toss,
a pizza resplendent with oceans of sauce.

             The author, Jack Prelutsky, makes reference to some common pizzagate-related tropes : pizza, ping-pong, cannibalism, organ-trafficking (read the "Eyeballs for sale" poem). It may be a coincidence. I'll be really happy if it turns out to be one. Or it might be a piece of something bigger and sinister. I'd rather point out to the congruity and err on the side of caution. Hence, the call for more information.

              Hence, you saw "pizza" and "cannibal humor" and decided it juuuuuust might be relevant.
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe next you could check out every single Halloween-related book or movie marketed towards children for all of THEIR cannibal jokes. I'm sure at least some of them will contain references to pizza.

               Tbh, I'm not even on board with all the theories and rabbit holes by the regular pizzagate crowd, although I subscribe to a good portion of it...for example, I agree with the accusations of foul play levied against just about every major player named, although I may or may not agree about all the details or even whether there is evidence enough to convict - at least there's something /there/. In contrast, the OP is a witch hunt with no details to go on other than pizza and a goofy kids poem. Rubbish.

                What you "subscribe to" is neither relevant, nor particularly interesting. This sub is not exclusively about your views  and "theories" you support. A citizen's investigation is a puzzle made of thousand pieces. Some pieces fit immediately. Other take time to fall into place. Still other, never do. So what? Have you read the OP? I'm not accusing Jack Prelutsky of anything. Sometimes a cheese pizza means just a cheese pizza, even in a poem for  5 yo. But as we all know by now, cheese pizza could be a code-word used by pedos.  It could be just a coincidence that Mr. Prelutsky has a poem about "eating fresh eyeballs". But what if it isn't? Knowing what we know, I'd rather have the OP here, archived and searcheable for further investigation and future reference, than not have it. You don't need to read it, to do additional research or to comment on it.

                 You're not accusing him of anything in a court of law, you're just opening him up to mob harassment and investigation. Based a book about pizza and a poem about eyeballs...

                 You can, and should, use discernment about the types of information you present to this investigation, otherwise you are wasting people's time with wild goose chases and as the other commenter pointed out, making everyone look crazy. Sometimes pizza is really just pizza.

                What does magic have to do with the OP? It's about children's poems using words, language, references etc. that have been shown to be code-words used to describe child abuse. The OP is a call for additional information and further investigation. Again, I hope it's nothing.

               <li>
                Some forms of children's sexual abuse are indissociable from occult practices, whether or not you believe in the occult.
It's enough that pedophile predators believe that abusing innocent children somehow empowers the abusers.  Have you heard of Aleister Crowley?

                None of that was depicted in the video.  It looked like the opening credits to the blandly inoffensive network television sitcom Malcolm In the Middle through an LSD filter.

                There is no evidence to support this opinion.  Insinuating there is only adds another hurdle for us to jump over on the path to helping the kids.

I had been dealing with bizarre, deviant behavior for many years and had long since realized that almost anything is pos­sible. Just when you think that you have heard it all, along comes another strange case. The idea that there are a few cunning, secretive individuals in positions of power somewhere in this country regularly killing a few people as part of some satanic ritual or ceremony and getting away with it is certainly within the realm of possibility…"
