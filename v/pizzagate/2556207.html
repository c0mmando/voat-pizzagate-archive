<p>So a fourth woman has come forward and alleged being raped in Soros Fund Manager\'s sex dungeon. Howard Rubin is the animal\'s name and the story is so disgusting that I won\'t repeat it. But what I will do is point out that the victims was brought into the game of \'yeah, sure\' I\'ll stop if you say your safe word -- NOT!\'\' by a 20-year-old woman. This absolutely confirms these animals use recruiters who apparently don\'t have anything better to do than sell someone out so they can make some cash and curry favor with a big shot.

<p>The woman, who has requested anonymity in her $7 million Manhattan Supreme Court suit as a rape victim, met Rubin through a friend in November 2015.</p>
<p>The pal set up a date between the then-60-year-old Rubin and the 20-year-old woman at the Russian Tea Room in Manhattan, the suit says. The woman was told she’d be paid $2,000 for dinner and drinks, but that <strong>she would not be required to have sex.</strong></p>

<p>Ha! </p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the penthouse pad, the married Rubin allegedly served his mistress a drugged drink and ushered her into his “dungeon-like ‘toy room,\'” a 300-square-foot space with “ropes and toys to tie people up with, and electrocuting devices, and other devices,” the suit says.</p>
<p>“Rubin instructed plaintiff to say pineapples if she got uncomfortable, or if anything became too much for her,” the suit says.</p>
<p>But the financier ignored the woman after she shouted “pineapples” when he smacked her hard across the face, the suit says. She begged him to stop as she repeated the safe word while he beat and raped her, first anally with a “big black dildo” and then vaginally with his penis, the suit says. ...</p>
<p>The friend who introduced her to Rubin warned her not to go to the police because Rubin “was extremely wealthy and powerful, and would destroy her life,” the suit says.</p>
<p>She finally decided to sue after a suicide attempt.</p>

            And the fact that MSM does not cover this tells us that that it's a mouthpiece of the Rothchilds / Soros. This is the kind of tabloid that every major outlet can't wait to get their hands on! Tabloids galore. As David Seaman noted last year during one of his rants - MSM (CNN, ABC...FOX) are state run propaganda machines. Rothchilds reimburse them at any given moment! The myth about high ratings is just that - a myth!!!! If they were about ratings how about Podesta-Spiritcooking for ratings!!!!! How about this one - Soros hedge fund manager Howie Rubin torturing women in his penthhouse dungeon! - Ratings will shoot through the roof! 
These CIA infiltrated Mockingbird propaganda outlets need to be exposed once and for all. 
Just look at that Santa Fe Drill Hoax where the so called Doctor (wearing a masonic pendant around his neck)can hardly contain laughter. Demand questions. Why is Howie Rubin not all over the News, but fake drill psyop is still dominating MSM?!!!!

             Yeah, and why in blazes would he have to drug her if he gave her a safe word and was going to stop?
            </p>
            <p>
             Evidently, he didn't want her to object ... at least not as stridently as she would have without the drugs. And I'm really wondering about soundproofing on that room ... ??? Must have really been reinforced for neighbors not to hear all these women screaming their lungs out.

             Added, but I always get confused about this rule when the subject has already been accepted and posted about previously. I mean, if Rodstein has already had a submission that tied him to pedophilia, why in blazes do we have to keep proving he's tied to it? He had a handler who recruited women for him ... he works for Soros ... this is the fourth woman ... ???

              Don't be confused, MP; just always provide a sentence or two summarizing the PG connection. If you know we've covered it before, do a quick SearchVoat.co search and drop in the link to the previous thread. Most people who read this sub have not read the majority of threads, may not necessarily remember every name and how they are connected to the Pedo elite, and probably don't know how to search our archives. You are writing for more than other researchers. The more hyperlinks you have to background information, the more valuable, helpful and damning each of your submissions will be.

             I didn't mention his name? That's odd.
            </p>
            <p>
             I didn't mention it in the title because the title has to have something to do with pizzagate. If it doesn't, the submission gets a flair and taken down. Soros is tied to pizzagate. If i mention Howard Rubin ... not so much even though he definitely is involved in pizzagate through what he does and through his association with Soros.
