<p>Nine-year-old Connor B., who suffered sexual abuse as DCF shuffled him between seven different foster homes in three years. Connor struggles with severe mental, behavioral, and emotional challenges as a result.
Adam S., 15 years old, who was severely beaten in a residential treatment facility. DCF failed to provide him with a permanent family and gave him no preparation for living independently as an adult.
Camila R., 13 years old, who was separated from her two sisters and returned to her abusive mother, has lived in at least 11 different placements while in foster care. DCF denied her vital educational and mental health services.
Fifteen-year-old Andre S., who has been legally free for adoption for over 10 years and spent seven of 12 years in the state’s care in a residential facility rather than a foster placement or relative’s home.
Seth T., 13 years old, was bounced between five foster placements in his first sixteen months in foster care.DCF has effectively cut Seth’s ties with his family, arranged visits with his brothers only a few times a year and never properly explored the possibility of placing him with relatives.</p>
<p>Fifteen-year-old Rakeem D., was not only immediately separated from his three siblings, but also denied the opportunity to live with relatives who may have been able to care for him. As DCF has moved Rakeem through at least eight different foster and group homes, his education and behavioral health has suffered.

            PS.  If any of you live in Massachusetts please contact your Officials.  Tell them you will never vote for them again if something is not done about this.  Believe me, if they get enough calls and they are on they up and up they will respond.  Elections are coming up.

            This should SHOCK everyone.  We have all heard of these horrid deaths and abuse because of DPS and Foster Care.  But this is SHOCKING.  What will it take for people to stop staring at their phones and Binge Watching to take notice of what is going on around them?  Idk, but I am Totally Sickened by this report.  If people want more Horror Stories, go to Medical Kidnap and you will find them, if you need proof.  This is so Heartbreaking.
