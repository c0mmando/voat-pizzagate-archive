<p>One of these Panda children was following a pedo who has been brought up here on Voat a couple times and he has interacted with us in video\'s....</p>
<p><a href="https://vid.me/robert04330/followers">https://vid.me/robert04330/followers</a></p>
<p>I had posted about some insane things going on in his Vidme video\'s like talking about going to visit girls he talks with in different states. One video was when he just got back from visiting a girl in Maine He was very flustered and mostly talked about the drive but then said he has pics and video\'s for sale the usual way.....then there were video\'s asking his followers if he should visit other girls.
I had the link bookmarked and decided to check if it was taken down or something by now and there are EVEN MORE video\'s.
This guy is definitely no master mind I think someone is paying him to do things they can sell and no one is taking him down...why?</p>
<p>Anyway I decided to look into who was following him and went down the Panda rabbit hole then came back to who he was following.
I clicked Longpiglovers profile and like many odd accounts, there\'s just one short recent video. I think it\'s an ad for something extremely sick and when you click to watch the very short video which has almost 1,500 views (which is safe for work) also click every profile that liked it and you will see something else weird going on.....https://vid.me/Longpiglover</p>',

            oh shit, robert04330 - the lifetime registered sex offender from Maine... holy crap, so this piece of human waste IS protected on some level... he's also somewhat infamous as a proud pedo on the web, here's his offender listing:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.homefacts.com/offender-detail/ME4683/Robert-L-Robinson.html">
             http://www.homefacts.com/offender-detail/ME4683/Robert-L-Robinson.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            and here's an "advertisment" where he posts a phone number across the screen in 200 point type, claiming to have set up some sort of server arrangement for NAMBLA... sick puppy, this one
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.homefacts.com/offender-detail/ME4683/Robert-L-Robinson.html">
             http://www.homefacts.com/offender-detail/ME4683/Robert-L-Robinson.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I wouldn't advise calling that number without a "burner" that can't be traced back to you. Especially if this freak is working for someone else.

            You know, looking at that vidme guy visiting girls, I'm reminded of the basic fact that most of these pedos are just not attractive, and biologically speaking if a minor was into being with a much older pedo, they wouldn't choose these fuglies, they'd choose a good looking person like Brad Pitt or something. John and Tony podesta are hideous. And that old guy from the chickenhawk movie saying that a boy initiated sex in tent is totally full of it. When I was a kid I thought girls in their teens and twenties were cute, not some flabby ball fannypack-wearing old man. It just doesn't compute from a darwinian standpoint.

             robert04330 apparently photo-stalks people. Many do NOT seem to be aware that he is doing this (judging by pics posted at his Flickr feed, you must be logged in to view), however some APPEAR as if they may be "in on the gag", and are allowing him to "surveil" their children on field trips and such. Difficult to say, but he's a photo stalker without doubt.
            </p>
            <p>
             link to his Flickr (sorry, just a general link... he has about 3,000 pages, mostly crap but also some "hair porn" - apparently he likes jerking off in women's hair buns, and he places these photos in EXTREME proximity to photos of young girls with long hair. sick. it's all in there with his shitty apartment and poor sick cats)

            Longpig is a term that describes human meat, as in humans for eating. Because a human body prepared for meat looks like a long pig apparently. So that is extra sick. is the video something to do with cannibalism?

             so how did "longpig" enter this discussion? I know what it means, just what is the context, as per robert04330?

             God knows, we've already detected plenty of references to cannibalism (direct and indirect) in these various pizzagate rabbit holes...

             I think they flash locations of where a crime was committed and then that frying pan does not look like it contains bacon. That video is way too active and the accounts that like it are all weirdly similar and suspect. Followed by a definite pedo, Robert, and liked by what look like fake Maine and NYC police accounts with same header pics.

            According to several survivor's that I have studied their stories, the sex, satan, mind control issue is all very connected. One stated that the pedophilia aspect is the cover for the true evil, which is satanism and mind control. I have been looking for clues as to where this subject matter could be in plain sight with hidden clues. I have not been brave enough to do any reading, but have discovered there are quite a few sites that claim to have 'mind control sex stories' which is what I googled. Perhaps a lot of this is hidden in what has always been viewed as straight porn venues.
