            Put it on a few dozen thumb drives and anonymously deliver it to a few dozen relevant people. One of them will pick it up. If they don't try something else. No harm in trying.

            Because the government is no longer valid and all law enforcement is suspect, the only thing that can be done now is to form a law agency belong to a civilian force. We need to become organized, acquire secure property including old bunkers that can be used to store evidence and data. And above all. All members must be vetted to the extreme! And all who are qualified to work the management and programs end must remove them selves from any conflict of interest to the extreme and not have any ties with anybody out side their family and closest friends and no outside money connection. Nobody would be the "boss" of anybody, no HR dept. all volunteers and if funding is available, potential for pay coverage for time and effort. This is a life threatening issue and many who have already actively engage in the battle have died already. 100's if not 1000's of agents have died over the last 50 years investigating human trafficking and pedophilia. This is not new and it is and always has been huge.

            You also need to understand how and what makes these people tick, what they actually respect.. Read about Al Capone if you want to better understand the mind of a psychopath. These people only understand violence, but even violence can't make them talk. Interrogation expertise is required. Take for example Muslims, the threat of pigs blood will make them talk better the sodium pentathol.
           </p>
           <p>
            Knowing your enemy is the most important thing there is. These criminals are all very successful on in your face everyday on TV.

           <p>
            They stick up for each other better than any body. Because the consequences for them is horrible if the don't. 
FIND OUT WHAT THAT IS!!!

             Read this by Brandon, he's the MILITIA leader for all USA,

            </p>
            <p>
             Read this site, then go to Brandons site alt-market.com and offer your solution, if Brandon thinks its worthwhile he will make it happen
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm serious
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             During Burns-Oregon occupation this past winter Brandon held the militia's back, he declared the BURNS occupation bullshit, and I also agree.
            </p>
            <p>
             Brandon thinks that PIZZAGATE is real, share your concerns with him as a post on alt-market-com, after you read his post on this link. If he concurs that the militia should be a repository for the evidence he'll take care of implementation.
            </p>
            <p>
             These people have many things on their plate, so you have to be loud to get their attention.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Lastly, don't worry about PARTISAN-SHIP the militias know that TRUMP is also owned by the PEDO-ELITE.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             We also need to consider a witness protection program for "pizzagate" witnesses the armed militia would be a better trusted  source than say the FBI, or your LEO
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             As of today most militias in the USA have been give notice and put on alert, an ultimatum will soon be delivered to DOJ/FBI to take action, or the militias will take action.
            </p>
            <p>
             Biggest problem today is offering security for the 100's of cops working with the militias that want to blow the whistle. I think with the COP PENSION fund collapsing today in Dallas the cops now know there is no point in perpetuating the insanity that is WASH-DC.

            Sometime back on another site, a self-claimed lawyer said the thing to do was first journal everything you're doing so you can prove you are looking for evidence of crime, not seeking porn for yourself.  The next thing proposed was to backup everything you found twice.  Then talk to several different law enforcement agencies, such that none of them can bury it because there's another that has it.

             Excellent make it a sticky, that said I would suspicious if this claim could protect U or your ISP. Real pedo's aren't dumb, they would just create a pedo-investigation club, and pin all their leads on the wall, and if they got busted they would have proof they were doing it for the children.
            </p>
            <p>
             It might be better if you had the funds, to pass what you found to a lawyer you trusted, and have him/her hold said evidence, and allow him/her as an agent of the court to deliver to authority's. Dealing with fucking lawyers is expensive at $200/hr, or in DC they're $1000/hr. So only a rich investigator could play this game.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another point before anybody play this game, first go find lawyer that accepts this theory, and have him on a retainer, pay down say $3000 and have a contract that you are a citizen journalist investigating pedophilia, and that you have an understanding that all CP found shall be delivered to your court-agent and shall retain NADA in your residence.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is all an expensive game, and depending on the AG/prosecutor where you live and how cozy they are with your lawyer, ...  you would still be in DEEP fucking shit, if they searched your house and found CP tangible or electronic.

            Only way to do it would be to buy a burner phone with cash, don't activate until you are hours from your home, park your car in an overnight spot, walk at least an hour to a coffee shop, make sure you're wearing a hoodie and sunglasses, have the information downloaded to an SD card, activate, insert SD, post to every site you can think of including the Chanz, remove SD card, toss phone in trash, walk back to car making sure you avoid as many cameras as possible, drive home and hope for the best.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not sure what to do with the SD card at this point. Logically you destroy it and stay alive so probably that.

             OK good stuff, but please make a list of sites, so that people can follow your advice, and make this a sticky. I agree with what you have said, but hypothetically every single site is like /voat, so once the 'source' posts its going to be deleted and not just a soft delete ( archived ) like here on voat but real delete (SCRUB)
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you know of any sites that you can mention, where stuff would actually remain?
            </p>
            <p>
             Then our source would also need to alert the world, something like an 'amber alert' where an investigator could alert other investigators that something has been found.

              Well, thinking about it a bit. If it was me, I would just post to 4chan.org/b/ and leave it at that.
You won't be able to run a Tor browser on a burner phone, posting to FB or any other would require a login/pw email address.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yeah I would just post to /b/ and maybe /pol/ a couple times over 10 minutes then GTFOT

            If you even DUMPED a single piece of CP from your car window you would go to prison for a long time.

            Stapling CP to telephone poles would only turn the public against pizzagate investigation.

             Yes, but we need to have a sticky that walks the entire process from TOR install, all the way to onion objective, and having a trusted VPN. 
The exact location, we need an app that would encode evidence. Then say the 'source' could post link to the dark and say 'here is evidence, if you can prove your LEO  I will drop you the keys, if you can prove your legitimate MSM I drop the keys". I think this way open CP ( Evidence ) would not have to be handled or passed.
            </p>
            <p>
             It seems the rules are not to link to CP ( rule#1 Voat ), but linking to evidence leaves it open, especially if its KNOWN that the link contains encrypted package for "LEO EYES ONLY"
            </p>
            <p>
             The app could be similar to hushmail automatically post (HIGHLY ENCRYPTED PACKAGE) to deep-web and send public HEADER ( non-identifying info to voat/sub? ) that way we have a public track of new evidence, but only LEO affiliates would be given access, by having MANY LEO affiliates world-wide it would be NOT possible for one agency to cover-up, and course do what wikileaks does have many distribution sites where no gov could block.
            </p>
            <p>
             Russian, ,China, North Korea, Syria could possibly be interested as their enemy's are our enemy's. Perhaps somebody knows of legitimate 'caring' LEO in USA? I don't, seems like the way you get promoted in LEO these days is to cover up the elite crimes. We know already USA,UK, &amp; Saudi are worst.
            </p>
            <p>
             IMHO best support would be Mexico, Italy, Spain country's that love children, and would kill a PEDO in an instant. Catholic priests may fuck boy's "Initiates", but they kill baby fuckers. Look at the MOB ( the real mob Italian, not the jewish pedo mob ) they always killed child fuckers.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think there are legitimate news source in Mexico, Italy, Spain, maybe Iceland they're not fond of the PEDO-DOLLAR?

              Yeah, deep web material is dangerous if we're not LEO. But this only goes to show that they have access to evidence to prosecute but refuse to prosecute. Further, federal judges have shown in the past that they will not prosecute to the fullest extent of the law. epstein, for example, got the opportunity to settle out of court after raping minors.
             </p>
             <p>
              We're on our own, and the law is not on our side. The law actually protects these people, and this have been proven. How then do you stay within the premise of the law when it is the law that you're up against? I'm not talking about LEO on the state or local level, I'm talking about LEO on the federal level which include but is not limited to cia, fbi, etc....
             </p>
             <p>
              I, for one, am willing to handle material that could get others killed. Let's just say they can't kill me.

             Folks we seriously need a drop site, that can be trusted.

             Pizzagate, investigating where do the 8 million vanished children, where did they go, goes as we know to the trillionaires that even Barrons doesn't even mention that exist. Names like SOROS,BUSH, GATES,BUFFET, that is just low tier.

             Going back to red/blue pill, blue pill is you trust LEO, red pill is you know the truth, yet trust anon-internet ( mostly owned by GOV ),,
            </p>
            <p>
             We know that 80% of CP is FBI honey-pots, we can assume that +80% of sites like voat are same.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anybody real would be shutdown NSA/CIA would put pressure on ISP via local LEO, just mention CP and boom.

             BUSH family owns SERCO-GROUP which owns all satellite communication on earth including air-traffic control and BUAT, the remote navigation of all commercial flight where since 2007 all flights can be commandeered by DC.

             Perhaps dark-web is the solution an onion site just for pizzagate, or maybe a block-chain that automatically encrypts 'evidence' but PGP protected so that contents would be none-damaging to ISP.

              Is their actually a country on Earth where you could actually trust anyone. Norway seems pretty focused on cleaning it out.
