            My antennae went up several days ago when both Podesta and Hillary appeared on MSNBC within a few hours of each other.  They BOTH said that they expect Trump to come after Hillary and her campaign to distract from the Russia scandal.  By now everybody knows the M.O. of the Clintons.  When they know something is coming they always try to preempt by accusing the other side of what they are doing.   That was the most encouraging signal i have seen in months that this time something really is coming.  The Clintons are as predictable as Ex Lax.  And as stinky.

            The most damaging response to "The Russians Did It" is the following:
            <strong>
             Under whose watch?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            I've redpilled quite a few people with simple logic:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Did the Russians hack voting machines? No.
            </li>
            <li>
             Did the Russians force people to vote one way or the other? No.
            </li>
            <li>
             Did the Russians work hard to INFLUENCE the election? Possibly, but is that a crime? Haven't we done this to other counties?
            </li>
            <li>
             IF the Russians did try to influence the election, and they did so thru covert or illegal means, under whose watch did that occur? Obama. Isn't he to blame if the Russians found a way to influence elections? Trump wasn't President yet...so doesn't the blame fall on Obama for not keeping us safe?
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Mind you: I voted for Obama, twice. But if there is PROOF of Russian hacking or forcing the election results, then it happened while Obama was in the White House and he MUST be held responsible.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Try the logic game with your friends. It's amazing how slow and steady wins the race.

            First thing that needs to be done is getting those disgusting JA photos and 'artwork' at CPP, Podesta canabal pic, etc., aired on MSM that would be enough to shock the public into realising something more nefarious is going on!

            Trump appointed the prosecutor in Epsteins trial (who gave him a wrist slap) as Secretary of Labor his admimistration. Small world.

            But you idiots ignore  all that because the Russians only pushed Pizzagate fantasy

             Holy shit,CTR arrived with talking points. This is what they're going with LOL. You're going to prison buddy. Better give up that $10 an hour you're getting paid now, because treason is punishable by death penalty. The shills are fucked too.

            Wikileaks had extensive proof of HRCs illegal coordination with PACs. Podesta was also running unofficial fund raising parties in his home, writing in code about pizza, handkerchiefs, pasta in his email. Podesta has a bunch of creepy pedo art in his house, the same house that he had kids at his fundraisers. If I remember right almost $20,000 dollars a plate he was getting, so someone paid that money in order to have those teenage kids there at the fundraisers.
           </p>
           <p>
            So when HRC starts going on about how she doesn't think that even PG people thought there was kids held at Comet Pizza, and that she feels sorry for the shooter... of course she feels sorry for him, she probably paid for the false flag, and is responsible for him being locked up somewhere now. It's political genius, divert all the attention away from her campaign manager being a pedo.

            If the truth got out, it would expose that it's not about a little basement, but far worse. It's global and she's a part of all of it! Including organ harvesting! This woman makes me absolutely sick.

             She is.  Info on Anthony Weiner "life insurance" email trove....DebWasserman Schultz has a monstrous case building against her.  It won't be direct.  It'll be via people looking to trade off prison time for info.
Sessions is still firing people @ DOJ--FBI still being cleaned up as well...prosecution Agency and investigative Agency both need to rid themselves of Obama/Killary loyalists who would vandalize cases.  People FEAR Killary, they don't love her.  She's toast.

             Wrong. She used to be above the law, not anymore. You fail to realize that Trump and his administration, led by the US military, led a counter coup against the Deep State pizza cult, and we are at war with them.

             There are dueling scripts now at war with each other for how the whole thing ends. The light vs the dark. Both sides are ALL IN. The ending will be decided by us.

             Clinton was involved because that's the job of the Secretary of State and this had become a diplomatic incident.  It was quite apparent AT THE TIME, the US State Department was monitoring the situation and nobody considered it a scandal.  BECAUSE ALL OF THE PRESS, both US and and International understood that this is an absolutely routine function of the State Department.   There was nothing damning revealed in Clinton's emails that wasn't apparent in 2010.  This only makes sense to people who don't understand this.  The State Department gets involved in Americans arrested overseas.  It doesn't matter what the crime is and doesn't matter guilt of innocence.  The state department issures that the rights of Americans are seen to.  It does not get involved in any actual trial.  Silsby faced justice in a Haitian court and was convicted.

               This is one day after Silsby arrest.  So Silsby and group get arrested the Desk Officer of the US Embassy gets a call about the arrest, he alerts consular affairs. Folks at consular affairs try to find out who these people are and by googling the name of the group, an official at the State Department finds that document on the website of Laura Silsby Church in Idaho.  That document is then attached to an email that goes to Cheryl Mills who then send it to Clinton about 20 hours after Silsby was arrested.
              </p>
              <p>
               Reuters had an article up on the group about the same time.

                 The State Department intervened as quickly as it did because that is routine when consular affairs is called.  There's a rotating position called a Duty Officer who has to be available 24 hours a day and carries around a big book of contact information so that a US citizen can always reach someone even in the middle of the night.  I think they are on duty 48 hours at a time and then it rotates.
It went up the chain to the Secretary because it became an international incident with headlines around the word with 10 American Baptist Missionaries arrested.  News reports referred to them like this
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Church Group Arrested for Trafficking.  Ten American Baptist church members .....

                  Ten U.S. Baptists arrested trying to take 33 children out of earthquake-shattered Haiti say they were just trying to do the right thing, applying Christian principles to save Haitian children.

                <p>
                 Southern Baptists are part of a voting bloc that went 80% against Democrats.  Can you imagine the headlines and conspiracy theories, if the State Department didn't become involved?  Three Presidents of the Baptist convention urged Obama to do more during this case.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The State Department was also criticized in the Amanda Knox case for reacting slowly.  Knox didn't even get a lawyer at first.

               The prior connection was the basis for saying there was any connection between Hillary and Silsby.  It started here.

              <p>
               And you are making this connection:  Laura Silsby busted for trying to steal kids.       Silsby getting arrested had nothing to do with Clinton who didn't even know who she was until she was arrested.

               This is a question that makes no sense whatsoever.  You're viewing things through an incredibly narrow prism. Why would Hillary do anything?  Why would Hillary even be aware this was happening?   Alert Sense is a private company.  Do you think they need Hillary's permission to hire someone?

                Your right why would she  do anything to protect children? She has no morals and no soul.   Look at the covering up she did, of pedophilia at the State department, when she was an active employee. She let her daughter take money from Haiti, to use on her wedding. Think about that.

                Bhenghazi is when my issues began with Killary. I really don't want to rehash every detail so you would never know the extent of my grasp, I could be writting for weeks.
               </p>
               <p>
                Next you will be saying she completely missed the cannibal art on Podesta's office wall, or she didn't know her secretary's husband was an mk ultra pedo project from MIT, and they weren't close with Epstein either.

                 Yes, her name showed up in the emails and she has no connection to Hillary Clinton whatsoever other than the fact she was an American who were arrested when Hillary Clinton ran the state Department.  You want to link Silsby's crime to Clinton and there's zero basis for it.  The State Department's Consular Services apply to all Americans no matter what they are charged with and no matter what their crime is.  It's simply ensuring your legal rights are adhered to and doing things like providing a list of attorneys in the country who can speak English.   The person still has to face justice within that country.

                 You obviously don't know the woman you speak of.   And you should admit you used a ludicrous example of Hillary Clinton trying to stop something she didn't know about and has no power or authority to stop.

                  Hillary and Bill Clinton took an extraordinary interest in Silsby’s case from the moment she was arrested and almost immediately stepped in on her behalf. The Harvard Human Rights Journal stated that one of Bill Clinton's first acts as special envoy for the United Nations in Haiti "was to put out the fire of a child abduction scandal involving American citizens." On February 7th, 2010, The Sunday Times reported that Bill Clinton had intervened to strike a deal with the Haitian government, securing the release of all co-conspirators except for Silsby. Prosecutors ultimately sought a six-month sentence in Silsby's case, reducing charges for conspiracy and child abduction to mere "arranging irregular travel." A shockingly light penalty given the circumstances of her arrest, which would likely not have been possible but for the intervention of the Clintons in Silsby's case.

                   And from the very beginning the pizzagate community came to a false conclusion:  That Clinton had been following Silsby since 2001 and thus her actions were due to a personal interest.  And this conclusion is completely false as I have shown.   All the other actions were viewed through this distorted lens.

This is false.  They did not take an extraordinary interest in her case.  They took AN ORDINARY interest.  This would have been provided to any other AMCIT, that is AMERICAN CITIZEN.    The Secretary of State gets involved when US citizens cause international incidents.  That is what happened here.   This is why there was no scandal AT ALL involving Clinton's conduct at the time it happened.

                   This is false.  Silsby went to Trial and faced Justice in a Haitian court.

                   My speculation is the original charges of kidnapping would not have stood up, because she didn't just snatch the children.  She spoke to their parents and their parents turned them over.

                  <p>
                   My understanding of the case is the 8 who got off basically left everything up to Silsby who told them things were in order.

                   All of the members of the State Department became involved because this was a group of American Citizens, not because it was Laura Silsby, not because they were directed to by Secretary Clinton.  That is the proper lens to view this incident.  All these people got involved because American Citizens were involved.  All got involved before Hillary Clinton had ever heard of Laura Silsby.

            ALEFANTIS: Well, we make everything from scratch. Other restaurants, even good restaurants, will, like, not roast their own peppers. You can just buy the roasted peppers in a can. Or you can buy garlic oil. Some products you can get, and they’re consistent and they’re easy. But I didn’t even know that existed actually until they said that. I was like, “What do you mean? There’s another way? You can just buy these things?” Because a lot of restaurants will open a can and put it on. Like our sauce — we harvest a whole crop of organic tomatoes — 10 tons of tomatoes every year. Can them all, store them in the basement, have like a harvest party when it gets loaded in.

             Again.  Comet does not have a basement.  It used to be a different restaurant.   It would be very, very widely know if it had a basement.

              Your obviously very familiar with DC architecture and specifically the architecture in the upper area of Connecticut Avenue.  I'll also assume that you are familiar with pre-Victorian construction in the area.
             </p>
             <p>
              So you can start by telling how construction methods of the period used common basements, like common attics, that were often wide open for all to use.  Many of these units eventually built dividing walls as the desire to have more private space became common.  A sledgehammer and an hour and now you can go from one "basement" to the next basement.
             </p>
             <p>
              In other words, at one point, Bucks and CPP were most likely the same building.  In fact, if you observe the architectural details, they all share the same roof line, meaning they were most likely all built at the same time, as one building.  But you knew that 'cause you not everything (not).

               So they are going to smash through the bakery in between the restaurants?   Also there's no basement under Comet Ping Pong.  It's not a question of shared a common basement.  What are they going to smash through to?

                   That's meaningless information.  The important info is for the dates of the building we are talking about.
The Buck's building was built in 1951. Comet's building was built in 1932.

              Isolating Pizzagate to the basement is Saul Alinsky 101. Everyone should completely avoid the basement pitfall. They probably store the kids in North Korea, who knows as of now. That's what we're trying to find out.

            Here is the entire interview, which takes place at "Politics &amp; Prose" which is near Comet Pizza and also suspect.
Starting at around 5:50 ish , the interviewer thanks Hillary for her call to and concern about Politics &amp; Prose when 'this pizzagate thing' started.   So apparently, Hillary has been  in contact with them about 'things'.

            She mentions Politic &amp; Prose out of nowhere and portrays it being a pure place. That must be where some real shit goes down. These people always project and flip the truth.

            This is an absolute sign she has not been a offered any deal. They would not touch this with a ten foot pole unless they are laying the legal framework. She now knows this is coming out and sh is trying to poison the well first. It is obvious alinsky tactic....but she would not play it unless desperate

             Thats so true because she ignored it for the past 10 months waiting for Russian investigation to impeach President Trump, after all they have probably been able to plant evidence on countless others before.  But it is not going to plan, because President Trump will not keep quiet and involves the public in everything.  Keep Tweeting Pres.Trump.  BTW LOVED THE GOLF BALL GIF! When I saw it before he re-tweeted, I was laughing my socks off............ Fantastic!!

             , I think it's pretty telling that she brought it up. Either she's setting up the frame work like you said or else she made a huge mistake by drawing people's attention to it. Either way it's a good thing.

             We are the priviliged/cursed few who had to fight to bring this to the light. Well, we are doing the last bit of leg work. Lots of people have sacrificed everyting to reveal this conspiracy. Seth Rich is one hero of many. He deserves a fucking monument ASAP.

               Trump is the American President. Either, he's either 100% with the people or 100% with the Deep State. By process of elimination, skeptics can figure out he's 100% with people. Therefor, he will restore justice because his prestigious job requires him to do so. For anyone who knows Trump knows this is really happening.

            Smug condescending bitch. A well rehearsed bit of theatre though. The narrative that she lost a lot of votes because misinformed people (wrongly) believed she and Podesta were involved in child trafficking is a high risk strategy. But of course because there isn't a basement at Comet Ping Pong she must be innocent. Thin ice.

                1.3 BILLION MUSLIMS cant traffick kids because they have no power.

               <p>
                Jews have all the power.
               </p>
               <p>
                Jews have historically been guilty of this.
               </p>
               <p>
                Jews imported Muslims in the West after the europeans had fought to keep them out.

                You picked the wrong group to white-knight for, stupid faggot, LOL! So dont feel so bad about failing to defend the indefensible and resorting to anti-Muslim slurs, classless as that is

               No. You're a shill. Shills will be outed and executed for treason accordingly. This was a US military counter coup AGAINST the Deep State pizza cult.

            Weaponized! There it is again, it's the Russians who is behind PizzaGate. And always that fucking basement. 
If "they" decide to fight this in public, they will lose. The evidence that HRC is involved in human trafficking and pedophilia is something she can't talk her way out of.
           </p>
           <p>
            I get mad as hell every time I see her, but not this time. HRC looks like shit, she is on the ropes. It's time for a fucking knock out.

              You comment on Voat's pizzagate posts like every day. You spend more time here than most real contributors. How do you expect anyone to ever take you seriously when you ask a question as retarded as this in a forum devoted to the subject. I guess we can all we be happy that shills like you are incredibly bad at their job.

               It's not Hillary's job, it's the Job of the State Department.  Bigger cases would go up to Secretary, but most wouldn't. You can definitely find emails on the State Deparment FOIA site about consular service for arrested Americans.  It's completely routine.  Here's three.

              U must be new to this site. Start with the laura Silsby story follow up on the Clinton global foundation. Marina Abramovich has admitted that  her spirit cooking invitation probably unduly influenced Hilary's loss. I'll admit there is a LOT of circumstantial evidence, but if she wasn't part of the elite protection system , her ass would be in jail--wait, my mistake----they don't do much to child traffickers if hey are elite-- a little fine and mane  a short  (under a year ) jail time if that. Justice is only served when it's the "little" guy

               There's a mountain of evidence that falls apart on the slightest examination.  Try and come up something coherent that actually stands up to scrutiny.

             LOL, the little people never get any real say in the sham that is the DNC nomination process, it's just political theater. The Democratic candidate is always pre-selected by the DNC elite.
            </p>

             As Bernie Sanders proved, even a guy with landslide levels of support can't win against the Superdelegates and the vote fraud.

            <p>
             BTW: Kamala Harris, the possible 2020 DNC annointed, has a track record of covering up for Catholic pedophile priests. To maintain the catholic vote, perhaps?

                hahahahahahaha GOOD one LA_Trump!  I needed a laugh after seeing that evil witch. Notice these sick pedos rarely let anyone questions them who has not been coached or staged?  I almost vomited when I saw a clip of her on The View, aaaarrrggghhhh......I want that Whoopi Godlberg and Joy Behar to go down at the same time, they make me soooooo angry I never watch unless a conservative is on to put them down!
