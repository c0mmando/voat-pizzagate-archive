            FBIAnon did say that the public needed to raise bloody hell to the point where that anger forces the administration to act. Perhaps we do need to go out and march, get loud. I think he's getting loud....it's all anybody WILL listen to. He made me pay attention, his videos led me to Webb's videos. I wanna get loud...

             We need to raise hell about the whole Clinton Foundation scheme, but i havent seen Seaman even spend 5 minutes on that, never once heard him "amplify" George Webbs shit once.  He seems too scared to lose any attention.

            He's passionate and committed to a righteous cause. He's put himself on the line while we can sit in the safety of our anonymity and  for some of us, criticize. There might come a time when we all will have to step up to the plate. Till then, support someone like Seaman, don't drag him down with negative comments.

If you're not Seaman, get off the dudes dick ffs. Watch George Webbs videos, then watch Seamans. Come back with an answer on who is ACTUALLY researching and spreading info. Also notice who asks for donation and who doesn't.
            </p>
            <p>
             He would be putting himself on the line if he actually said anything.. But he doesn't. Jack Posobiec has put himself on the line a fuckton more then Seaman, where's his worship? Oh yeah he doesn't have CTR on his side.

            not only was his friend and her roommate stabbed to death in an unexplainable home invasion, but a woman who wet to DC to investigate a site
            <em>
             for him
            </em>
            was brutally stabbed to death also. he tried to dismiss the coincidence,, because you naturally want to deny very ugly truths, it's human instinct, but his mind cleared and he realized that, NO, this is too bizarre to be a coincidence. 
why did the GOP force the Sessions hearing TODAY? because Nat'l Pizza Day is this Thursday. Trumps 4D Chess.

            One thing that we all know here is Ben Swann hasn't been missing since his accounts went dark. He was back on the air as an anchor the day he said he would be. It's possible David missed it, but he spoke about it like his claims were fact and he is wrong.

            I think this guy is full of shit. Either he's using his friend's death as a LARP (disgusting), he's seriously that self-important and delusional, or he already had some mental issues and only needed a tiny push. Because, he hasn't done anything to put him in danger! He has done no investigating. He has not reported up-to-date or relevant findings. He just says, "It's real, it's real, I'm in danger, give me money." Why does everyone here have such a boner for him? It's fucking suspicious. People run to his defense, insisting he's done important work... wtf.
            <br/>

             Waxdino.... You're my fucking hero. So sick of Seaman threads being on top, whilst actual research gets pushed down and even deleted by falcon. Have said it a million times on here... DAVID SEAMAN IS A FRAUD. How people aren't seeing this is beyond me. He hasn't done any bit of worthy research, hasn't recited any important finding in his clickbait videos.. Literally only says "pizzagate is real" and cries for donations.. Him and pizzagategear (or w/e that scrubs name is) are 100% bs. They should be the laughing stock of this community, not people we take serious. Beginning to think millennial falcon is actually seaman bumping his own threads to the top with the rest of CTR.
