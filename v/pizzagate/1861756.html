<p><strong>Craig Hatkoff and ex-spouse Jane Rosenthal</strong>  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Craig M. Hatkoff (born 19 March 1954) is an American real estate investor and philanthropist from New York City. Along with wife Jane Rosenthal and Robert De Niro, he co-founded the Tribeca Film Festival and the Tribeca Film Institute in 2002. <em>(wikipedia)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jane Rosenthal gave an interview last year about the reason that the Tribeca film festival had banned the documentary <em>Vaxxed</em>, a film about the possible links between vaccines and autism:</p>
<p><a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2016/04/08/why-vaxxed-was-shot-down-at-tribeca-up-close-and-personal/">Why vaxxed was shot down at Tribeca</a></p>
<p><em>excerpt:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why was Vaxxed shut down?  The answer? Jane Rosenthal and her (ex) husband, Craig Hatkoff.</p>
<p>Now, moving along: Jane Rosenthal’s husband, Craig Hatkoff, sits on the board of the <strong>NYU Child Study Center</strong> in New York—and that major, major Center is deeply involved in the research, study, and treatment of child psychiatric disorders. In case you’ve forgotten, autism is officially listed as a psychiatric disorder.</p>
<p>The NYU Child Study Center would never, ever, in a million years imagine that vaccines could cause autism. If they did imagine it, they’d shut up and march straight ahead with their brain imaging studies and other mainstream distractions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another article:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.henrymakow.com/2016/04/why-vaccine-industry.html">Jim Stone: Why Vaccine Industry Suppressed &quot;Vaxxed&quot;</a> </p>
<p><em>excerpt:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real reason Vaxxed was not shown at the Tribeca film festival in New York is that powerful people run a center for research on autistic children, and did not want a slow down in the flow of children through that center.</p>
<p>And now I will say it like it is: Craig Hatkoff IS THE ENEMY. He has set his &quot;Autism research center&quot; out in the open, as an open target of action from parents with destroyed babies. He has seen this film, and blocked it, to ensure autism thrives. That is an act of war against humanity, from someone who false fronts a position of &quot;trying to help&quot;. It is the same old filth we see everywhere, but this time we have a name, address, and organization that is actively seeking to create as many autistic children as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2016/04/attorney-patricia-finn-on-the-vaxxed-controversy.html">And in a third article</a>, there was a quite interesting comment (excerpt):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rosenthal cut De Niro off several times during the interview, most notably when De Niro was about to talk about Dr. Wakefield. Rosenthal tried to redirect the conversation away from Vaxxed despite that it was obvious that De Niro was there to talk only about Vaxxed because he feels, as he said numerous times, it is an extremely important film. De Niro did well and showed her to be the oppressive snake that she is. I\'m sure Mrs. De Niro was not happy that her husband was sucker punched by Rosenthal et al. in order to force him to withdraw the film. Now that De Niro has somewhat recovered and is figuring out what happened, I believe he will not let them get away with it.
Vaxxed is scheduled to be shown in California and La, is being held over for a third week in NY, and was shown this last Sunday at the Silver Springs International Film Festival in Ocala, Florida. </p>
<p>The film, which highlights explosionary accusations by Center’s for Disease Control Senior Scientist Dr. William Thompson (aka the #CDCWhistleblower), reveals compelling evidence that the CDC manipulated, misled the public and destroyed significant data linking Autism to the MMR vaccine (measles, mumps and rubella).</p>
<p>Thompson’s findings are a direct contradiction to the CDC’s and the federal government’s guidelines for vaccinations, which since the late ‘80s when pharmaceutical companies were given immunity from liability has escalated to include 49 doses of vaccines by the age of five.
Autism, if allowed to continue to rise at the current rate in the United States, puts the U.S. population at 1 in 2 children with an autism diagnosis by the year 2032. A controversial subject among parents who have been polarized by the ongoing vaccine/autism debate, the U.S. Government has continued to dismiss the connection while simultaneously offering no solution.

            , which, if I wasn't convinced upon watching the movie, am 100% convinced now. It's like reading about PG all over again, with the word 'debunked' being used 10 words into the very first paragraph.
The corporate media doesn't seem to realize that the harder they try to cover up the lies of their (((masters))), the more transparent they become.
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT: evidently
            <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/robert-de-niro-pulls-controversial-film-vaxxed-tribeca/story?id=37969292">
             ABCnews
            </a>
            has reported the link between vaccines and autism to be 'debunked' also. I guess that means all those thousands parents whose children were affected immediately after receiving the vaccine can sleep easy at night now.
As a parent who has allowed two children to be injected with MMR, this story makes my blood boil.

            Reminds me somehow of the suspicious death of numerous alternative Doctors about 2 years ago. Does anyone know/remember this crazy story? 
this is one video about it:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPv2tFEN5ss">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPv2tFEN5ss
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            One of those doctors was Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez, who was the doctor of actress Suzanne Somers.
She also doubts the official version of the stories and said this back then on facebook: @2:21

            I read the article and it is shocking.  I also made sure my friends read it as well.  It is so sad about Dr. Molden and I wonder how many others have been silenced for telling the truth.  I have not believed the CDC for years.

            It is terrible about Dr Andrew Moulden, he left an ebook available on amazon. He claimed that every vaccine causes injury, he explained how and he shows how to identify it.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Canadian physician Dr. Andrew Moulden provided clear scientific evidence to prove that every dose of vaccine given to a child or an adult produces harm. The truth that he uncovered was rejected by the conventional medical system and the pharmaceutical industry. Nevertheless, his warning and his message to America remains as a solid legacy of the man who stood up against big pharma and their program to vaccinate every person on the Earth.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dr. Moulden died unexpectedly in November of 2013 at age 49.
            </p>
            <p>
             Because of the strong opposition from big pharma concerning Dr. Moulden’s research, we became concerned that the name of this brilliant researcher and his life’s work had nearly been deleted from the internet. His reputation was being disparaged, and his message of warning and hope was being distorted and buried without a tombstone.

            !  Access to kids and agenda's which "help" children seem to fit the MO.  What you have uncovered is one tight circle with ties everywhere but apparently you have find the tie that binds.  Keep on this..it feels UBER important!  Consider...there are kids they use for sacrifice/food, they need a way to id kids that will not be missed.  Also, how do they "train" their children?  They disassociate them at a very young age but could this be a front for better disassociation methods than raping and torturing them?  Just speculating but luciferian's pretty out there with research on blood of the young, etc.  WELL DONE and up votes for this and your other today!!!!

             I'm sorry to hear about your child. Please find a naturopathic doctor who deals with vaccine injury they can help a great deal. I know one mother who lost her first baby but didn't put it together until she nearly lost the second one the day after a vaccine. I saw vaxxed, it didn't really have anything I didn't know before but it was put together in a very understandable way. I can see why they are trying to suppress it. And note, they do not advocate to entirely avoid vaccinating, they say the schedule is the problem as well some of the vaccines are totally unnecessary like the vaccine for Hep B at birth when the mother can be screened for it.

             It's not too late...even severe autism has been ameliorated by micro-nutrients. There have been medical studies to prove it.
            </p>
            <p>
             You might want to have a look at this study:

            I have never believed the CDC and their lies. The UK found Dr. Wakefield's findings to be bogus. 'This country then started a witch hunt against him as well.  Every year the statistics on autism are climbing.  Something is very wrong with the findings of the CDC, imo.
