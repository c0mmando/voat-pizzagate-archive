<p>&quot;THE ORDINARY RESPONSE TO ATROCITIES is to banish them from
consciousness. Certain violations of the social compact are too terrible to utter aloud:
this is the meaning of the word unspeakable. Atrocities, however, refuse to be buried.
Equally as powerful as the desire to deny atrocities is the conviction that denial does not
work. Folk wisdom is filled with ghosts who refuse to rest in their graves until their stories
are told. Murder will out. Remembering and telling the truth about terrible events are
prerequisites both for the restoration of the social order and for the healing of individual
victims.</p>
<p>The conflict between the will to deny horrible events and the will to proclaim them
aloud is the central dialectic of psychological trauma. People who have survived
atrocities often tell their stories in a highly emotional, contradictory, and fragmented
manner which undermines their credibility and thereby serves the twin imperatives of
truth-telling and secrecy. When the truth is finally recognized, survivors can begin their
recovery. But far too often secrecy prevails, and the story of the traumatic event surfaces
not as a verbal narrative but as a symptom. </p>
<p>Witnesses as well as victims are subject to the dialectic of trauma. It is difficult for
an observer to remain clearheaded and calm, to see more than a few fragments of the
picture at one time, to retain all the pieces, and to fit them together. It is even more
difficult to find a language that conveys fully and persuasively what one has seen. Those
who attempt to describe the atrocities that they have witnessed also risk their own credibility.
To speak publicly about one’s knowledge of atrocities is to invite the stigma that
attaches to victims.</p>
<p>The knowledge of horrible events periodically intrudes into public awareness but
is rarely retained for long. Denial, repression, and dissociation operate on a social as
well as an individual level. The study of psychological trauma has an “underground”
history. Like traumatized people, we have been cut off from the knowledge of our past.
Like traumatized people, we need to understand the past in order to reclaim the present
and the future. Therefore, an understanding of psychological trauma begins with
rediscovering history. </p>
<p>THE STUDY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA has a curious history—one of
episodic amnesia. Periods of active investigation have alternated with periods of
oblivion. Repeatedly in the past century, similar lines of inquiry have been taken up and
abruptly abandoned, only to be rediscovered much later. Classic documents of fifty or
one hundred years ago often read like contemporary works. Though the field has in fact
an abundant and rich tradition, it has been periodically forgotten and must be periodically
reclaimed.</p>
<p>This intermittent amnesia is not the result of the ordinary changes in fashion that
affect any intellectual pursuit. The study of psychological trauma does not languish for
lack of interest. Rather, the subject provokes such intense controversy that it periodically
becomes anathema. The study of psychological trauma has repeatedly led into realms of
the unthinkable and foundered on fundamental questions of belief.</p>
<p>To study psychological trauma is to come face to face both with human
vulnerability in the natural world and with the capacity for evil in human nature. To study
psychological trauma means bearing witness to horrible events. When the events are
natural disasters or “acts of God,” those who bear witness sympathize readily with the
victim. But when the traumatic events are of human design, those who bear witness are
caught in the conflict between victim and perpetrator. It is morally impossible to remain
neutral in this conflict. The bystander is forced to take sides. </p>
<p>It is very tempting to take the side of the perpetrator. All the perpetrator asks is that the
bystander do nothing. He appeals to the universal desire to see, hear, and speak no evil.
The victim, on the contrary, asks the bystander to share the burden of pain. The victim
demands action, engagement, and remembering. Leo Eitinger, a psychiatrist who has
studied survivors of the Nazi concentration camps, describes the cruel conflict of interest
between victim and bystander: “War and victims are something the community wants to
forget; a veil of oblivion is drawn over everything painful and unpleasant. We find the two
sides face to face; on one side the victims who perhaps wish to forget but cannot, and
on the other all those with strong, often unconscious motives who very intensely both
wish to forget and succeed in doing so. The contrast . . . is frequently very painful for
both sides. The weakest one . . . remains the losing party in this silent and unequal
dialogue.” </p>
<p>In order to escape accountability for his crimes, the perpetrator does everything
in his power to promote forgetting. Secrecy and silence are the perpetrator’s first line of
defense. If secrecy fails, the perpetrator attacks the credibility of his victim. If he cannot
silence her absolutely, he tries to make sure that no one listens. To this end, he marshals
an impressive array of arguments, from the most blatant denial to the most sophisticated
and elegant rationalization. After every atrocity one can expect to hear the same
predictable apologies: it never happened; the victim lies; the victim exaggerates; the
victim brought it upon herself; and in any case it is time to forget the past and move on.
The more powerful the perpetrator, the greater is his prerogative to name and define
reality, and the more completely his arguments prevail. </p>
<p>The perpetrator’s arguments prove irresistible when the bystander faces them in
isolation. Without a supportive social environment, the bystander usually succumbs to 
the temptation to look the other way. This is true even when the victim is an idealized
and valued member of society. Soldiers in every war, even those who have been
regarded as heroes, complain bitterly that no one wants to know the real truth about war.
When the victim is already devalued (a woman, a child), she may find that the most
traumatic events of her life take place outside the realm of socially validated reality. Her
experience becomes unspeakable. </p>
<p>The study of psychological trauma must constantly contend with this tendency to
discredit the victim or to render her invisible. Throughout the history of the field, dispute
has raged over whether patients with posttraumatic conditions are entitled to care and
respect or deserving of contempt, whether they are genuinely suffering or malingering,
whether their histories are true or false and, if false, whether imagined or maliciously
fabricated. In spite of a vast literature documenting the phenomena of psychological
trauma, debate still centers on the basic question of whether these phenomena are
credible and real. </p>
<p>It is not only the patients but also the investigators of post-traumatic conditions
whose credibility is repeatedly challenged. Clinicians who listen too long and too
carefully to traumatized patients often become suspect among their colleagues, as
though contaminated by contact. Investigators who pursue the field too far beyond the
bounds of conventional belief are often subjected to a kind of professional isolation. </p>
<p>To hold traumatic reality in consciousness requires a social context that affirms
and protects the victim and that joins victim and witness in a common alliance. For the
individual victim, this social context is created by relationships with friends, lovers, and
family. For the larger society, the social context is created by political movements that
give voice to the disempowered. </p>
<p>The systematic study of psychological trauma therefore depends on the support
of a political movement. Indeed, whether such study can be pursued or discussed in
public is itself a political question. The study of war trauma becomes legitimate only in a
context that challenges the sacrifice of young men in war. The study of trauma in sexual
and domestic life becomes legitimate only in a context that challenges the subordination
of women and children. Advances in the field occur only when they are supported by a
political movement powerful enough to legitimate an alliance between investigators and
patients and to counteract the ordinary social processes of silencing and denial. In the
absence of strong political movements for human rights, the active process of bearing
witness inevitably gives way to the active process of forgetting. Repression, dissociation,
and denial are phenomena of social as well as individual consciousness.&quot;</p>',

            Kinda makes you wonder how many patients in Psychiatric Hospitals are there primarily for their inability to effectively cope with what happened to them, or the perpetrators who are often close relations inability to risk the truth ever destroying them....
           </p>
           <p>
            You know that shit happens too, of course victims of sexual abuse are 100 times more likely to have psychological &amp; behavioral problems because of it, wonder how many incestuous and complicit relatives decided to turn on the victim exacerbating and exaggerating the symptoms forcing the victim into institutionalization?
           </p>
           <p>
            "Daddy can't lose his career and go to prison, neither can brother, and we all like Uncle Chester.... Sorry honey, you're just extra-ill, take your meds now, take a few more, a few more....".......... "What's that we chemically induced a psychotic episode, too bad, and he/she was almost getting better. Oh-well, guess it's off to the Mental Hospital for him/her."
           </p>
           <p>
            And the same way the quote talks about witnesses, bystanders, people stumbling across such information struggling to put it to words, imagine that effect on the victims?

             There's no way we could ever imagine what the victims have gone through, we shouldn't complaint for maybe a little of that hell.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             5 Stages of Grief:
            </p>
            <p>
             1 Denial – The first reaction is denial. In this stage individuals believe the diagnosis is somehow mistaken, and cling to a false, preferable reality.
            </p>
            <p>
             2 Anger – When the individual recognizes that denial cannot continue, they become frustrated, especially at proximate individuals. Certain psychological responses of a person undergoing this phase would be: "Why me? It's not fair!"; "How can this happen to me?"; "Who is to blame?"; "Why would this happen?".
            </p>
            <p>
             3 Bargaining – The third stage involves the hope that the individual can avoid a cause of grief. Usually, the negotiation for an extended life is made in exchange for a reformed lifestyle. People facing less serious trauma can bargain or seek compromise.
            </p>
            <p>
             4 Depression – "I'm so sad, why bother with anything?"; "I'm going to die soon, so what's the point?"; "I miss my loved one, why go on?"
During the fourth stage, the individual despairs at the recognition of their mortality. In this state, the individual may become silent, refuse visitors and spend much of the time mournful and sullen.
            </p>
            <p>
             5 Acceptance – "It's going to be okay."; "I can't fight it; I may as well prepare for it."
In this last stage, individuals embrace mortality or inevitable future, or that of a loved one, or other tragic event. People dying may precede the survivors in this state, which typically comes with a calm, retrospective view for the individual, and a stable condition of emotions.

            I think what people don't realize, I am just realizing, is that we who refuse to look away from this ARE witnesses.  We have witnessed an identifiable set of evidence in photographs, victims paintings, written comments, symbols, so called music and art, narratives and more recently, a concerted cover up in the internet and the media.  Many many if not most or all individuals who have given witness to these materials and events have been physically sickened and psychicly tormented and even poisoned to a degree.  We've seen the faces of perpetrators and victims, crime scene areas and all the shadows across them all.  Every last one of us has died a little.

             You're kinda right. Maybe that's another reason why most people avoid even to pay a little attention to these issues. But don't think that this is killing us. Maybe because everyone avoids to look and face with the darkness, these brutal creatures can abuse and kill little children. We sacrifice them for our own comfort. Maybe we have to sacrifice ourselves a little, "die" a little to save these children.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is from the same book:
"Trauma is contagious. In the role of witness to disaster or atrocity, the therapist at
times is emotionally overwhelmed. She experiences, to a lesser degree, the same terror,
rage, and despair as the patient. This phenomenon is known as “traumatic
countertransference” or “vicarious traumatization.” The therapist may begin to
experience symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. Hearing the patient’s trauma
story is bound to revive any personal traumatic experiences that the therapist may have
suffered in the past. She may also notice imagery associated with the patient’s story
intruding into her own waking fantasies or dreams. In one case a therapist began to
have the same grotesque nightmares as her patient.." etc
            </p>
            <p>
             So, if nobody listens to these people, how can they heal? And if they don't heal, there's the danger that one day they might become those creatures too. Maybe that's the real reason. Just because we don't care, nobody cares, sickness grows in many person's souls and turn them into psychopaths in the end. We never share anyone's burden, we left them alone. So, demons possess them.
            </p>
            <p>
             If truth must come out, we must pay the price. Truth is a heavy thing.

              of course.  I said we have all died a little in honor of the trauma that pretty much everyone associated with looking into this has experienced.  That "traumatic countertransfernce" sounds spot on.  Even that phenomenon happening the way it did tells me this topic has something very real underlying it.  A palpable sense of terror and souless evil.  But it can be countered and fought.

            Super helpful.  Only thing I would add is that it needn't be a 'political movement' for social support. (last para.)

            I am religious and God and Church have brought immense healing.  Would be nowhere without it.  Sometimes, it is enough to know that my wounds are 'hidden in the wounds of Christ.'

            <p>
             I agree with you.
But I think what is meant here is, in order to come up as a reality in the society, these traumatic events and issues I mean, there must be some kind of political force, to be able to resist the widespread tendency to suppress these things. Because when you speak out loud, you will be silenced and you'll have no support.
            </p>
            <p>
             And somehow, these trauma issues remind me that part from Matthew 25:
            </p>
            <p>
             "When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, He will sit on His glorious throne. All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate the people one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will place the sheep on His right and the goats on His left.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then the King will say to those on His right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave Me something to drink, I was a stranger and you took Me in, I was naked and you clothed Me, I was sick and you looked after Me, I was in prison and you visited Me.’
            </p>
            <p>
             Then the righteous will answer Him, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You something to drink? When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You? When did we see You sick or in prison and visit You?’
            </p>
            <p>
             And the King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did for Me.’
            </p>
            <p>
             Then He will say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave Me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, I was naked and you did not clothe Me, I was sick and in prison and you did not visit Me.’
            </p>
            <p>
             And they too will reply, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?’
            </p>
            <p>
             Then the King will answer, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for Me.’
            </p>
            <p>
             And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”

              Agreed.  The political will is also important to have behind this.
             </p>
             <p>
              As the saying goes, "the Church is the soul of the State."   Thatt time will come when these divisions (sheep - goats) will start happening not only spiritually, but in political and tangible ways as well.
