            It gets alot deeper, and freakier:
           </p>
           <p>
            Genesis P-Orridge is deeply embedded as a mind control agent, a real life Joker if you will, and deeply involved with Rick Rubin and the recording and producing industry's plans to subvert the world with 'satanic' and grotesque art to aid in the conditioning of the masses.
           </p>
           <p>
            "In February 1992, while Orridge was in the country of Nepal, a British TV documentary accused him of Satanic (pornographic) child abuse from a Psychic TV performance-art video taken from his home. Scotland Yard seized about two tons of Orridge’ possessions and threatened to imprison him, and told him that they could not guarantee the artist’s physical safety if he returned to England. So, along with his first wife and their young daughters, Caresse and Genesse, P-Orridge fled to Cazadero, a remote community of around three hundred and fifty people in Sonoma County, California.[25]
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1995, hidden in the Rubin’s Laurel Canyon compound they found Genesis Breyer P-Orridge that had been driven out of the compound injured by a fire.
            <strong>
             Genesis is considered one of three of the High Magi of the Left Hand Path– SATANISM
            </strong>
            .[26] The other two were (British Intelligence MI-5) Aleister Crowley, the Great BEAST 666, and the CIA’s Timothy Leary.[27] Genesis is an ardent hard core Crowley devotee and the founder of the Temple of Psychick Youth (TOPY).[28]
           </p>
           <p>
            Many of the Tenets of TOPY were based upon the Satanic teachings of Robert DeGrimston, founder of the Process Church of the Final Judgment. During the 1990s, Genesis revived the Process Church.[29]
           </p>
           <p>
            Rick Rubin’s secluded haunted studio mansion compound in Laurel Canyon once belonged to Houdini. Its “… foundation is said to have been riddled with secret passageways, tunnels, and hidden chambers. Similarly, the grounds of the estate were (and still are) laced with trails leading to grottoes, elaborate stone structures, and hidden caves and tunnels.”[24]

            Also I'm not exactly very human myself.  However, I do have empathy.

             Ive watch so many videos so not sure if I did but I know about the missing 50 kids and Queen was found guilty. I also know people saw her shapeshift on live tv (her birthday) and Twatter scrapped most of the tweets and I read this event was why the Royal website put up that announcement of her not being human.

             I can feel the war of light vs dark but there's also so many people claiming to be lightworkers, so much info dump (factual &amp; false), so many directions/misdirections that's it's muddying up what is real and what is not. But the Queen being an evil, vile snake is true.

            Christ Church CoE of Hampstead was refurbished following the children's disclosures, why was this? The church asked for donations on their website, which is no longer available publicly but SiteIndicator shows that the website is still active

            Here's the screen shot taken from that website, dated 19 Jan 2015. After the Sept. 2014 disclosures, before the releasing of the videos publicly online. The website states, "Works required includes repairing and replacing stonework, the roof, the
            <strong>
             interior wood floors
            </strong>
            ,
            <strong>
             the paintwork
            </strong>
            and stained glass."  Sounds to me like they were interested in concealing or destroying a crime scene....

             Have you got a link to the transcript of Dearman's interview with the police?  Finchley pool where the children say they were also molested also underwent refurbishment.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              There is McDonald’s on High ROAD at Finchley Lido Leisure (a/k/a East Finchley Swimming complex with Vue Cinema, Pizza Hut Express and other shops) and there is also McDonald’s HQ near the East Finchley tube station where there are multiple kitchens for training purposes.
             </p>
             <p>
              The High STREET location was never specified by the children, as far as I can remember (and yes it was closed in November 2013).
             </p>
             <p>
              Also of note, the
              <strong>
               Finchley Lido Leisure Center JUST completed (2015-03-04) a MAJOR REFURBISHMENT
              </strong>
              at a cost of £150,000 in which more spacious/updated changing rooms and other updates are described (see:

              I know the Hampstead McD's closed Nov./13 but that is the same school year that the two children disclosed (Sept/13-June/14, disclosures Sept/14)
There are more screen shots on my blog post, "Destroying the Crime Scenes?  There are screen shots I took about the Finchley Lido refurbishment  as well

               Great info. And seriously people, how often does a McD ever close down? I saw this 7 months ago and I still cringe when I drive past one. Also, the pink slime meat from years ago...makes me sick to think about

               <p>
                Anyone who says this interview was bogus simply has to look at the Cohen Report
                <a href="https://cohenreport.blogspot.com/">
                 http://cohenreport.blogspot.com/
                </a>
                which is entitled, "Rabbi Abe Finkelstein outwits Gentile PastorJames Wickstrom".  Here's the entire article because it's relevant to the interview you posted.....
               </p>
               <p>
                "Pastor James Wickstrom, a notorious anti-semitic, Christian Pastor and holocaust-denier, and Zionist Rabbi Abe Finkelstein, an affiliate of the Chabad Lubavich and religious advisor to the Plymouth Rock Institute of Research, reached a disposition today in a case involving arbitration, says PRIR research associate, Howard Grobstein.
               </p>
               <p>
                The case stems from a dispute about compensation for an interview between Wickstrom and Finkelstein. Pastor Wickstrom asserted that Finkelstein promised to pay for half of the expenses involved in arranging the bellicose interview, the rights to which were to be mutually shared by both parties. However, Rabbi Finkelstein averred that this promise was legally unenforceable for three reasons: (1) The promise was oral rather than written; (2) Alternately, the promise was written but had been orally revoked prior to Wickstrom's acceptance; or (3) That Finkelstein lacked the requisite intent to enter into a contract, either verbal or written, due to an antecedent repudiation of any intent to make a promise.
               </p>
               <p>
                An impartial arbitrator in this case, Jacob Katz, ruled in Finkelstein's favor. "Prior to entering into the contract with Wickstrom," Katz told PRIR correspondents, "Abe had taken his Kol Nidre oath, which nullifies any subsequent written contract with Wickstrom."
               </p>
               <p>
                When asked about the arbitrator's decision, an angry Wickstrom told reporters, "This is absolutely ridiculous! I have the contract right here in my hands, signed by him! Somehow this contract is no good just because that Jew crossed his fingers behind his back!"
               </p>
               <p>
                But Rabbi Finkelstein was jubilant. "Oy Vey," said Finkelstein. "I feel so relieved now that justice has been done in this case. Katz is a very wise...very impartial arbitrator."
               </p>
               <p>
                The Jewish Kol Nidre oath, which Finkelstein purports to have taken prior to entering into a contract with Wickstrom, holds in pertinent part:
All vows...oaths...or equivalent terms that we may vow, swear, consecrate, or prohibit upon ourselves...we regret them henceforth. They will be...abandoned, cancelled, null and void, without power and without standing. Our vows shall not be valid vows; our prohibitions shall not be valid prohibitions; and our oaths shall not be valid oaths.
               </p>
               <p>
