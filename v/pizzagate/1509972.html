<p>\'The jilted fish-seller\'</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sandra said she received no money from the Clinton Foundation and, in fact, took out a large bank loan at its urging. Paying this loan proved to be a tremendous burden, she said. Even worse, within months the head of the Acceso project told her that she should no longer deal directly with buyers. Instead, she would sell her fish directly to Acceso — at sharply reduced prices — and Acceso would resell them. In other words, the Clinton Foundation would act as a middleman and profit from margins supplied by the people it was supposed to be helping. Sandra and eight other Acceso participants immediately dropped out, she said, worried that “if we had stayed with them, we would have gone out of business.”</p>

<p>‘concentration camp for workers’</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...desk was stacked high with papers related to Pacific Rubiales’s labor practices, the result of years of investigative work by his staff. He did not see the Clinton Foundation and its partnership with Giustra’s Pacific Rubiales as either progressive or positive. “The territory where Pacific Rubiales operated,” he said, thumbing through pages of alleged human-rights violations, “was a type of concentration camp for workers.” Robledo said he had no doubt that Bill Clinton had successfully overcome legal and regulatory obstacles for Giustra’s benefit, especially given Clinton’s strong relationship with Colombian President Uribe and his stature as a former U.S. President: “Bringing Bill Clinton to Colombia was like bringing God,” he said.</p>

            Great post. Now that the FBI took a trip to Colombia to investigate that girl's slaying it's for sure that there are some bread crumbs to be found on the trail. Just hoping the FBI is a few steps ahead of us at this point :)

             FBI are in cahoots. This seems to be going over the head of many. DOJ and all the intelligence agencies have been infiltrated and basically work for the Elites. Child trafficking is part of their agenda. They do not bust their own ring.

              This has been evident for a long time.  So, is there any hope that that might change, or are we on our own to construct all new means of holding bad guys accountable for wrongdoing?
