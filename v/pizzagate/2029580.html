            Hey, IT'S NOT ABOUT SEX!
           </p>
           <p>
            You can have a billion adult women rubber blow-up dolls and a trillion prostitutes running around handing out freebie specals! Female neighbors might be all willing to have sex, and guess what? Adult women would still be raped!
           </p>
           <p>
            IT'S NOT ABOUT SEX! When are we going to get this through our heads? The dolls will do nothing to relieve the need to dominate, control, torture, and abuse! That's what rape is about! Doesn't matter if the victim is young or old.

             I understand your reasoning, just keep in mind that odds are that men who would use a child-like doll to play out a pedophilic fantasy are likely already involved in viewing CP for self gratification.  CP does hurt kids (and worse); I doubt that subscribers to it would be satisfied watching a guy with a doll, and I doubt a doll will prevent the attraction to watching CP.

             Uh, no.   a gay 50 yrs ago probably had a family and one secret boyfriend. Now theyre considered morally superior victims for getting HIV, which they spread by refusing to shut down their bathhouses.

             I understand what you are saying, in fact the guy in Denver created them to allegedly counter pedos, but they are still way too perverted to be on the market.  If the pervs. want to get their rocks off, let them go to the TOY STORE to buy a doll, i'm sure they will find something.

            I would rather a rubber doll be raped and violated than my children. Hell, even my enemies child could use a break..
I'd rather have pedophile fathers rape a smelly doll than their own children.

             Yeah... All I'm seeing from this is the UK trying to save face for ignoring the 1400 from Rotherham. Confront the actual pedophilic deathcult with actual victims first, by the time you're done with that we should have some data on whether or not the creepy fuckdolls have any effect positively or negatively. Also a lot of the other replies sound straight out of a puritans handbook, "porn is bad, rape still happens, its not about sex", when every country WITH porn sees less rape than those without. Japan has less rape than Britain. It is about sex, but it's also about
             <em>
              certain demographics
             </em>
             where it's considered polite to rape and murder a woman that isn't wearing a scarf, or to assfuck a boy because he's "that way", and then throw the boy off a roof when he's older. Creepy fuckdolls isn't an issue. Murder and rape is an issue. Now, if someones getting a creepy fuckdoll and they're watching youtube seminars on how to teach consent to a toddler, then yeah you have some red flags, but that's still not in the same league as a deathcult that teaches child rape as one of the most virtuous acts of the most perfect man in existance. Until you settle that problem, just let the creepy pervert be creepy perverts on their own property, until they die sad cold and alone, hopefully not collecting benefits.

              You put thought into that reply. About the sex dolls, I posted this in ignorance, they really have life sized baby sex dolls.
Those are the ones i would pay money to track down the "private" owners.
Purely for the natural selection aspect of life's biggest mysteries.
Those creepy rainbow pony ones also freak me out.
I really hope others see the logic of letting them self identify with every purchase.

               I'd actually rather have a voluntary registry for pedos. If you're so far gone that you're buying baby fuck dolls, and you have a shred of decency left, you should be able to recognize that you've got a serious problem, and you need people to ensure you're not a threat. To the point where I'd say every pedo should have one person they trust to put a bullet in their head if they go too far. Pipedream I know, since there's a bit too many people that would consider even the admission of being a pedo too far, and that'd scare the rest of them into hiding until they eventually snap and offend or just join the aforementioned deathcult so that they're beyond reproach. Still, a man can dream.

              Are you saying the ones who kill kids started on plastic? Like a gateway drug?
For some, dolls will never do to satisfy control.
You can't fix stupid, but if they wish to tell me who and where they are with each and every purchase, who am I to say no or make it hard.

             The problem is there is a good probability they will progress, and want more, like an addiction and craving.  If this becomes the norm, the ones with money and power will change the laws to further accommodate themselves.

              Sure, a fractional percentage will move on to live flesh. From what I have observed within the mental health community is they become shut ins who become afraid of contact if we mock them slow enough.

              The problem with that line of thinking is that you want to prosecute people before they commit a crime, which leads down a very slippery slope to complete control.

             You don't seem to understand the nature of the crime, or the nature of human predatory behavior that 'practices' sexual attacks, acting out, gaining confidence, as the real prize gets closer, that of attacking and humiliating, holding power over another person.   When sexual deviants should be either jailed if guilty or learning to abstain from sexual obsessive addictions, the dolls will embolden some people who might not have acted out, to eventually act out (imo).

              The day a sex toy bleeds from a vicious raping is the day you can school me on criminal behavior.
The dolls are easy to track from space. please think about the logic of protecting the most kids possible with the tools we have.
Make these "toys" easy to get because tracking rfid microchips globally has been around for a while now.

            BAN them in Every Possible Way from Every Which Way to Sunday! We had an article about them before and when I mentioned this to a relative they said, Oh, that can't be possible. I will have to print out the article and show. I know when they read it is happening in the UK I will hear, Oh you know those crazy Europeans!. If it can happen there, it will happen here. Why are people having a problem with believing this with all the wack job stuff we see on the news from day to day. People are Clueless.

             The toxic culture of selective ignorance is one of most frustrating aspects of PG.  People won't even listen to what is already happening here and what has happened here. There is no cure for active predatory pedophiles, people were fed the Kinsey lie that "offenders rarely reoffend" for so long that even though it's well established to be untrue, people ignore the fact.  Colleges teach that pedophilia is "normal" in some cultures, as if that makes it okay.
 We know that pedophiles will spend a lifetime into their 60s and beyond molesting kids and we know the devastation, and the psychological injury (beyond the physical) that child rape and molestation causes the victims.

              YES,  That is exactly what it is.  Selective Ignorance. This is exactly why they have infiltrated the schools.  They want to push their normalization tactics and beliefs on the innocent minds of our children.  Children are all about wanting to belong.  All about being taught to be kind to others.  This is what they are taught at home.  So why would they not want to accept this New Group that are so maligned when they are just doing "what comes naturally".  We know that is not true and it must be stopped.  They are in the fight for their lives and we are in the Fight of Our Lives. We Have To Win.`

               I suspect there a number of parents who I would call 'traditional liberal'...meaning they grew up protesting the draft, women's rights etc.  I don't think a lot of them are aware of what's really happening with the kids and the institutional pedo movement.  We may be saying something about kids and they may stuck on 'oh I remember believing pot should be legal when it wasn't popular to say it.'
              </p>
              <p>
               I met one very nice elderly couple, quite liberal (but who believe in borders, an American government, not communism, not globalist government), who had no idea some the crap going on, I told them about Evergreen College and they were pretty shocked over that.  Can't even imagine what they'd think of people sexualizing infants and having adults sexually stimulate babies and children as a 'normal' part of childcare.
              </p>
              <p>
               There is no way in hell that wanting to rape a baby can be called 'natural', and no way in hell that having sex with children can be considered 'having a relationship'.  Pedos use children as sex toys to live out their fantasies, once a child grows out the target age, a new child is 'fallen in love' with.

                A few of the people I talked to just backed off, like they were not having any of it.  I think it is such a heinous belief for them to accept that they just instantly block it out.  No, No Way, Can't Be.  Where did you hear that?  What sites are you on?  You really need to get off the internet if you are seeing that.  These are the people that are so wiped  out by pedophilia, that they are the most important to reach.  For they are the ones that will be Screaming From The Roof Tops.

                 I got that response from someone who also told me I spend too much time on the internet. While that may be true, the fact is that they were really reacting to my being upset as a way to avoid having to consider whether or not what I was saying true.  They don't want to know, don't care to ask.

                 It's almost as if some people can only hear a few bite size facts spoken in the most matter of fact tone, in order for a tiny bit of info to get around the defense system people have, causing them to shut the topic down altogether.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Our society has been effectively conditioned to avoid thinking about the 'off limits' topics (those which implicate people in power and expose the pedophile agenda, as well as the globalist takeover agenda), but many will put considerable effort into 'approved topics' to be upset about, such as strongly speaking out against the misuse of pronouns.

                  I can't stand that "well meaning" tone.  Like I know what is better for you.  This comes from mainly family members that are younger than I am.  They now treat everything I say with the unbelieving tone.  Also they are now convinced that almost anything I say I must have gotten from the same information source, so it is suspect.  I am wanting all of this to blow up.  I am so ready.

                   I was just saying this morning that we have to start seeing some indictments of notable people (not just the Reality Winners), but we can't really do that until a compromised justice department is dealt with (the conflict of interest Mueller's travelling circus, with all the Clinton lawyers he brought on board).  If Americans don't start seeing that treason/sedition and other serious crimes have consequences, then our country is lost.

                   As far as talking to people (keeping in mind I don't talk to that many people because it's frustrating lol), one thing that might help (over time) is pointing out other stories...for instance, the Awan story breaks out into what little MSM will cover it, but we've known about the Awan brothers/democrats for months.  So it hits the news and I say, "yeah we've been talking about that for months...glad it finally came out in the open.")   Also mentioning uncanny number of bodies dropping dead in relation to DNC investigation etc...and other curious 'coincidences'.

                    Yes, that is a great idea, bringing up the Awan case and adding Debbie into the mix because they know she was dumped from the DNC. But when I bring up the bodies, you know they are known as the Clinton Kill List, Oh No, the Clintons would never do that it has been debunked.  OOOH!!  I am going to go big time with that Awan story.  Yeah, we knew that a long time ago, I don't watch MSM.

             Hypothetical here. What if a pedo falls in "love" (emotional dependence) with a rubber doll?

              They will want to go to the next step.  It is only a temporary delay.  Just like when teens experience sex it always escalates.  Just like it did with us.  They will not be able to keep using that doll for the rest of their lives.  If we believe that we are seriously kidding ourselves.  I don't know about you, but since I have found out how much of this has been going on, we have evidently not been protecting our children enough.  They are NOT Little Adults.  That is why we have a special word for them alone.  Children.

            You guys are really going to splinter this movement to the point where it's easier and easier to make it look like only lunatics are involved. Protect children because they can't defend themselves. Silicone is a distraction, and I honestly think the outrage is designed to play on people's emotions instead of their intelligence.

             Try telling that to the mods who are always quick to delete. Unless it's something like this that makes us look petty and hysterical, then they have no qualms about leaving it up. Don't get me wrong OP I understand your concern but in the scope of things right now, rubber dolls are the least of our problems.

              That's like charging a 16 year old as a pedophile because his 15 year old girlfriend.is under the age of consent. Which has happened by the way.

               PG isn't about 15-16yr old teens in a romantic relationship having sex with each other.  And no, this:

               <p>
                When cops searched 72 year old Turner’s home they found more than 34,000 indecent images of children aged between three and 16 on computers and hard drives, as well as two other child sex dolls.

               ...is NOTHING remotely like the teen girlfriend/boyfriend scenario you described.

                 I was saying that the 72 year old pedophile with 34,000 indecent images of real children as young as 3, up to real teens of 16 years old, along with his having two other child sex dolls, should be prosecuted for having the images and for buying the illegal child sex doll.

                <p>
                 And I was saying that the 72 year old pedophile was nothing like your example of a 16 year old teen having a sexual relationship with a 15 year old girlfriend, which is not pedophilia.
