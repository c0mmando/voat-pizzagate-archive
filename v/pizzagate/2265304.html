<p>&quot;Demander-in-Chief An unfounded rumor held that Hillary Clinton threw a tantrum, and a water glass, after NBC\'s &quot;Commander-in-Chief&quot; Forum in September 2016.&quot;   <a href="https://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-threw-a-tantrum-with-matt-lauer/">https://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-threw-a-tantrum-with-matt-lauer/</a></p>
<p>Rumors holding that Hillary Clinton had a “meltdown,” threw a water glass at a staffer, and engaged in a curse-filled tirade following NBC’s Commander-in-Chief Forum with have been circulating since the Democratic presidential nominee participated in that forum, which aired on 7 September 2016. While these rumors do seem to be rooted in a little truth — the Clinton campaign was not happy with the questions Lauer asked (or didn’t ask) during the event &amp;mdash claims that Clinton threw a “hissy fit” are unfounded.</p>
<p>The web site Victurus Libertas was the first to promulgate this rumor, publishing an article entitled “Temper! Temper! Hillary Goes on Rampage for Over An Hour — Throwing Glass at Staffer’s Head.” Although Victurus Libertas linked to credible reports from NY Mag  and Yahoo! News which explained that Clinton’s campaign was miffed with Lauer for not fact-checking Donald Trump during the event, they cited Politicoas their source for the claim that Clinton had thrown a water glass at a staffer:</p>
<p>Republican Donald Trump also appeared, in a separate telecast from Hillary Clinton’s and arrived with his two sons but no entourage or assistants in tow.  The NBC cameramen involved in his segment said he was a ‘true gentleman’ and Trump and his sons spoke to everyone and thanked them for inviting him to speak: “It was a pleasure to answer your questions Matt.”</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton’s segment was much different. According to people working on the sidelines, “When Matt posed the one legitimate question about the FBI investigation concerning her homemade server and the unsecured emails, we could see she was beginning to boil and her eyes looked to pop.” </p>
<p>“It was toward the end of her interview so she was becoming unglued by the time Lauer finished with questioning.  
</p>
<p><strong>Hillary went ballistic, throwing a huge tantrum and screaming at her staff, “you f – – – ing idiots, you were supposed to have this thing set up for me and you’ve screwed it up!   If that f – – – ing bastard wins we all hang from nooses!</strong>  
</p>
<p><strong>Lauer’s finished…and if I lose it’s all on you ass – – – – s for screwing this up.”</strong></p>
<p>Clinton finally stormed off the military ‘set’ and the assistant producer said she was screaming that she wanted to talk to “the idiot who set this mess up…you do not blindside me – ever!” and continued to demand to speak with executives at Comcast, parent company to NBC Universal.</p>

            No.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't be ridiculous.    This is bunch of poppycock.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "Someone I don't like debunked this, so it must be true"  instinct is an example of closing your mind to facts.  It's unhealthy.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Clinton Camps complaints were not about "unscripted" questions.  It was about how bad Lauer was as the debate host and the fact Lauer wasn't pushing back on Trump's lies, particularly when he tried to claim he was always against the war in Iraq.  They were also upset that the debate was intended to talk about foreign policy, and again and again he asked about the email situation, while when asking about ISIS he wanted to be brief.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's some of the criticism aimed at Lauer.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "I was totally against the war in Iraq," Trump says, saying something that is not true. Matt Lauer offers no follow up.
            </p>
            <p>
             Please explain your plan to defeat ISIS "as briefly as you can." This forum is a joke.

              Pizzagate is being dragged into this fake two party system's battles against each other. They are battling for their position's in squandering taxpayer money. People seem to be under the illusion that Trump suddenly changed the Republican party into a non Zionist party.

              The weapons industry is a Zionist enterprise and they absolutely love the Trump administration. One week before the Saudi "corruption" purge (cash grab) Supreme Zionist Kushner went to Saudia Arabia.

              People are losing their focus on pedophilia. I think some people forgot where their bag of red pills are.

               Take your own advice.  You're all over threads adding your political dislike for Trump, Republicans and Jews.

               Posting about sticking to the facts about pizzagate isn't effective when it comes with a ladle-full of political bile.....ya know?

                I like Trump better than Hillary, but i'm not blind. I take all the red pills. I am pointing out the obvious mouse traps.
