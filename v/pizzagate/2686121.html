<p>Seems to have gained some views but I guess some of us missed it, as I did. </p>
<p>Just came across this on Twttr.. So thanks to those that made the connection, I Am just sharing it here as it could be a vital clue! </p>
<p>Thank you also to those in this link!</p>

<p>Here\'s a video of the real pool.... Similair pool as the painting.. </p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PdNUVPyolpo">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PdNUVPyolpo</a></p>
<p>Thank You <a href="https://voat.co/user/3141592653">@3141592653</a> for adding the video below! Awesome, but sickening..</p>
<p>EDIT: Here\'s a quick enhancement and edit of the real pool photo from what is said to be the place of the painting with the little boy hanging up, you can almost make out where the X in the paint on the tiles was. The middle of the X is above the light and then it goes off on the same angle and direction both sides.. And I do not feel this is because of a trick of light.. The X is clearly darker (was painted?) than the other tiles. </p>
<p>And to those that say the tiles are coloured in the paintings that could just be the artists addition and also as to not have it exactly match the photo the painting has been done from.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/0azQsqc">https://imgur.com/a/0azQsqc</a></p>
<p>Thanks to others for the above photo!</p>
<p>EDIT: Ok so what else it quite strange about this &quot;pool&quot; is it\'s complete lack of steps going to the bottom of the ladder, I mean even if it was full of water, would you still not take the steps most of the way down? I know it is probably accessible from the end the photo is taken but would it still not make sense to take them down to an accessible point whilst the &quot;pool&quot; is empty?</p>
<p>Said ladder: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/WQQVao5">https://imgur.com/a/WQQVao5</a></p>
<p>And also those talking about no drain, is that what the black pipe in this picture is?</p>
<p>EDIT: Here\'s the &quot;artist&quot; that did the paintings of the tortured kids. Sick stuff here so please be advised. and there is also the dentist chair that has become quite relevant throughout all of this:</p>

<p>EDIT: So long shot.. But could the guy on the far left in this photo <a href="https://imgur.com/a/XzQgQdy">https://imgur.com/a/XzQgQdy</a>  be a younger version of this guy <a href="https://imgur.com/a/olYCOOB">https://imgur.com/a/olYCOOB</a> ??? Vanderbilts grandson..</p>
<p>Could also be the same area: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/aHooW4W">https://imgur.com/a/aHooW4W</a></p>
<p>EDIT: This is an image of the waterfall located just outside of the Estate and has a small drain right next to a bigger drain which could be easily used as a tunnel/access: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/mwwxRzS">https://imgur.com/a/mwwxRzS</a></p>
<p>EDIT: Another painting by the same artist that shows some vicious dogs being held by some creepy men, the man on the left appears to be holding a club of some sort: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/OGUZNSv">https://imgur.com/a/OGUZNSv</a> </p>
<p>Which almost resembles the same clubs hanging in the Biltmore Estate gym that also has the same white tiles we see repeated in her paintings: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/LzuqAup">https://imgur.com/a/LzuqAup</a></p>
<p>According to G--gle this is in their winter garden <a href="https://imgur.com/a/RuyfkJD">https://imgur.com/a/RuyfkJD</a> it seems as if without the metal grate it would be a secret passage and why the metal grate?

           it seems as if without the metal grate it would be a secret passage and why the metal grate? Maybe for the tours it has been placed there but either way it makes it all the more creepy.

            Artist B. D.  came to USA in 2009 to promote her art, first in Washington D.C. where Tony Podesta may have been inspired to purchase some of her paintings. Then she settled in NYC for 2 years 2110-2011 serving as a visiting professor at the acclaimed Parsons School of Design.  Gloria Vanderbilt graduated from Parsons  and probably  promoted and supported it ever since which would have provided an  opportunity for  B. D. and G.V. to become acquainted.

            So I need to determine the dates the the hanging boy painting  was done as well as her painting of two boys, fully dressed who look alike but for hair color .     ( Anderson  &amp; Carter?)  B.D. seems to use her own face when portraying females of various ages.

            I noticed that pool described as a 50x50 plunge pool near the Turkish baths.  The dimensions are off but it otherwise comports with my notion that it is utilitarian. Scandinavians like to get overheated. in. a sauna then plunge into a cold bath. The ropes could have beenfor those guests who might have socialized in the water briefly before getting out.

             Your question about the hanging boy (so-called Anderson Cooper) painting is an interesting one.  I've always thought that 'he resembles Anderson Cooper' far too convenient for the whole pizzagate thing.  Is it a trap?
            </p>
            <p>
             Well, I went looking for the origin of the painting. After all  Biljana Đurđević has her own website and her work is recorded by art galleries and museums all over the internet.  All of it - except for this one painting.  I can only find it on pizzagate referenced websites.  No one has the details of where this painting came from.  If we look at the artist's website, she has her work posted in the stages in which they were. done.  That's what artists do.  They go through stages where they explore a particular theme.  So the tiles in that painting should give us a clue as to which stage she painted it.
            </p>
            <p>
             And that would be this one - Living in Oblivion (2005-2008) :
             <a href="http://biljanadjurdjevic.com/2017/11/living-in-oblivion">
              http://biljanadjurdjevic.com/2017/11/living-in-oblivion
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             No, 'Anderson Cooper' there.  So, the question is, where did that boy painting come from?  Did she paint this for a private client?  And was it done to purposely look like AC?  So that it could later be debunked?
            </p>

             I don't know.. I'm just askin....

            :  Has the pool been located on the estate? I just learned. that the Biltmore's cafe restaurant consists of the original ornate  horse stalls  wherein the stalls have been converted to booths and the other side consisting of tables where the. other half of the horse stalls probably were. The number of remaining stalls is quite large . This facility is not to be confused with present day equestrian center. .
           </p>
           <p>
            The stalls look like "tie stalls"  wherein the horse is tied for the day with no room to move. You might see thisat show grounds where you are trying to cram in  as many visiting horses as  possible. The estate was built pre-auto.so if there were grand parties or a hunt, the horses would have to be put up somewhere.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ive mentioned before the utilitarian quality of the pool and speculated that it might have been a pool for horses. So....after all this,  is the pool near today's  Stable Cafe?

            Okay, this is starting to get bizarre.  I'm posting this here as only top level comments can be found on google searches. If I just add it as a reply to my previous comments I won't be able to find it again.  So this is further to:

             Yes, hung by the pool.. Could be a theme here. And Re hunting parties, the estate has more than enough Forrest surrounding it and back when it would of been in use there would of been more and they could get away with all sorts. My feeling is this estate and trail could hold some sort of smoking gun or sadly at least this estate is the grave of many many people..

             "A onetime paratrooper who is not in line for the Belgian throne of King Baudouin, De Ligne said he was drawn to the rail project by Christopher Harriman, whom he described as a personal friend he met in Paris.

            <p>
             Harriman, who accompanied De Ligne on his recent trip to the Capitol, has made a number of claims about his own background and business dealings that have not been possible to verify. Among other things, he said he is related to the late diplomat Averill Harriman, a claim disputed by the Harriman family in Washington. He cited business ventures with the prince, including a luxury hotel in Thailand with a grandson of the Thai king, but the Thai Embassy said it had no knowledge of De Ligne or Harriman."

               In April, we remember Biltmore’s landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted, born April 26, 1822. Often referred to as the “Father of Landscape Architecture in America,” he’s best known today as the designer of Central Park in New York City.

                Vanderbilt’s estate was modeled after two other impressive houses. One of these was a manor in Buckinghamshire, England called the Waddesdon Manor. This magnificent house was also a place of escape and rest for its owner, Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild. Furthermore, Vanderbilt wanted to make his home a place where he could display many works of art and many styles of furniture just like in this famous European manor. Interestingly enough, the architects of the two houses were friends and discussed their plans for each house with each other. This is why there are many similarities between the structures of the two houses, such as the spiraling staircases (Covington x). The Waddesdon Manor was a model for the great estate that Vanderbilt aspired to build, but the Chateau de Blois in the Loire Valley in France was also an inspiration for him and his designer.

             Once completed, the mansion had four acres of floor space, 250 rooms, 34 bedrooms, 43 bathrooms and 65 fireplaces. The basement had a swimming pool, gymnasium with changing rooms, bowling alley, servants’ quarters, kitchens and more.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Memorial’s form was inspired by the lighthouse of Alexandria, Egypt, one of the ancient Seven Wonders of the World, and its design reflects the classical architecture of Greece and Rome. These styles connect the Memorial to the architecture of Washington’s day, when the classical aesthetic was used to express the democratic principles guiding the new republic. The Memorial’s entrance, inspired by the Parthenon, is of the Doric order. The interior of Memorial Hall is a of modernized Composite order. The three sections of the tower ascend in levels of complexity, with Doric features at the bottom, Ionic in the middle, and Corinthian at the top. The Tower is capped with a pyramid and surmounted by a stylized finial that symbolizes Light. The Memorial is a beacon that spreads the Light of Freemasonry and the legacy of Washington to all humanity.
            </p>
            <p>
             The landscaping of the Memorial grounds was done by the renowned Olmstead Brothers firm. Founded by Frederick Law Olmsted—who designed the grounds of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., New York City’s Central Park, the Biltmore Estate in North Carolina, and the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago—the Olmsted Brothers remained influential for more than a century.

           </p>
           <p>
            As someone who is a survivor of Pedogate (1960's - approximately 1980's,) although I've never officially been to the Biltmore Estate, I have recognized three areas of it since v / PG and v / GA started researching it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I basically just recognize having been on the main staircase, and in the fourth floor room with the spiral staircase that looks like an office ("the observatory,") in a bad but not horrible way.  However I get a very bad vibe-memory from the third area, which is the room at 5:40 with the architectural model of the house.  I can only assume they must have done horrible things to us children in that room, and maybe still do.
All three areas are in this video from 4:45 - 6:10 or so:

             My thoughts and prayers are with you through this! The whole estate just has a creepy as fuck feeling to it and after researching all this for long enough you get the feel as to whether things are right or not.. And at the moment my heart is saying that the painting of the kids is in the "pool"

               I had commented in a different post that my father (still alive at 90yo), told me that when he was an aircraft mechanic in the 1960s for a very large (and still prominant) oil company, that a pilot told him about flying company execs to N. Carolina for sexual encounters with 12 year olds. Was the  Biltmore still in private hands at that time?
              </p>
              <p>
               I also mentioned in another post about paranormal incidents scaring visitors, especially in the pool room..We are onto something here.

              That is an interesting comment by Gloria Vanderbilt. I have seen her interviewed about the death if her child and I've no doubt of the sincerity of her feelings of grief. There is absolutely nothing in the world like losing a beloved child.  I wonder whether she's talking about the soul being purified through suffering.  Tragedy and grief are said to be like a fire that refines the soul. New Agers believe that, as our souls evolve and grow (often through suffering) our vibration quickens. As our vibrations are raised,  we move closer to God.  In the Catholic tradition, victim souls suffer voluntarily for the good of even the sinful. They suffer so that the sins of others can be expiated.  There is also the belief that some ascended souls come here not to learn but to teach, and these are the souls who suffer the most in life.

             Could well be idk for sure.  The bottom pic he is a little thinner in the face than in the top one.  A little pudgier?  There is a resemblance though.  I want to know what are those chains for in the bottom picture.  The guy standing looks like he is getting ready to use the one in his hands.  Doesn't look good to me.

             EDIT: Ok so what else it quite strange about this "pool" is it's complete lack of steps going to the bottom of the ladder, I mean even if it was full of water, would you still not take the steps most of the way down? I know it is probably accessible from the end the photo is taken but would it still not make sense to take them down to an accessible point whilst the "pool" is empty?

            I myself have never seen a deep end ladder with rungs going deeper into the water than the one at the Biltmore.  I don't think there's a need, but it's not something you can notice through the water.  Here's an

            What's creepy to me about the Biltmore pool ladder is it looks like it folds up and out of the way.

            A 1900 book describes the Biltmore House pool as being 50 feet long x 50 feet wide, and marble.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's not that size, and it's finished with glazed tile, not marble.  I'm thinking the dimensions were maybe a mistake/due to wrong information, and calling it marble may have been a manner of speaking, as the room is mostly marble??

            states the plant storage room has been replaced by a staff break room.  However in looking at their photo, and then at the floor plans, correct me if I'm wrong but I think the break room is just one floor down from the Winter Garden.
           </p>
           <p>
            It might be nothing, but why such a deep and tall plant storage room, unless I'm looking at this wrong?  The conservatory for plants is very large, was built in 1895 like the house, and is not too great a distance away.  Maybe the conservatory was too humid for some plants, I don't know.

             I'd agree that the pool is nominally 50' x 30' = 1500 SF X avg depth of 4' = 6,000 CF = 44,883 = Capacity estimates cited in other sources.

             Plant room - I'm still looking for a good picture from above, but here is a picture of the conservatory:

            <p>
             Given the period and probably very large palms, etc. in very large concrete planters, it would make sense that they moved them indoor during the winter to keep them alive.  Not sure why you would move them 3 levels below the light source.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't think it refers to a root cellar.

              The first photo in your link actually shows the glass-topped Winter Garden, set into the main floor of the house.  It is a conservatory:

             </p>
             <p>
              But "The Conservatory" is a separate building:

              I think you have hit upon important points.  Maybe they kept very tall palm trees down there, I had not thought of that.  Although strange about the light.  Also I did read in one place it was for "plants and vegetables," now I think it was a root cellar, in part.

             I forgot to add this to my comment above.  In 1963 when the Biltmore Estate applied to become a National Historic Landmark, they cited "Biltmore Photo-Gravures" as a major bibliographical reference (p. 146,) for what that's worth.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In 1900, Biltmore: Photo-Gravures, a handsome pamphlet with eighteen views of the mansion, buildings, and grounds, was published by H. Taylor Rogers and available at his book and stationery shop in Asheville. Other promotional books, pamphlets, and brochures promoting the area also included views of the house. (p. 119)

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In 1883, George Washington Vanderbilt began buying land near Asheville and soon afterward began building famed Biltmore House.
            </p>
            <p>
             At one time, the Biltmore Estate included over 100,000 acres. When George Vanderbilt died in 1914, it became part of Pisgah National Forest; Wild turkeys and
             <strong>
              deer
             </strong>
             wander there to this day. In 1963, in the early, heady days of the space program, the government carved this spot out of the Forest for NASA's Rosman Satellite Tracking Station, which monitored missions from the early satellites through the Apollo program and Skylab project.
            </p>
            <p>
             By 1981, however, with new geo-synchronous satellites, the end of Skylab, and the agency's new interest in the space shuttle program, NASA no longer needed the tracking station.
             <strong>
              So the Department of Defense took over the station to use for intelligence gathering by the National Security Agency, and a shroud of secrecy fell over the site.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Until recent years, few people without a high security clearance knew about the Rosman station or what it did when it was run by the National Security Agency. Information about the facility's use from 1981 to 1995 is classified.
            </p>
            <p>
             When the facility closed in 1995, local employees signed confidentiality agreements to keep them from divulging anything they may have seen or taken part in while they were there. As Powers put it," The past is the past."

             <p>
              The Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute (PARI) is reported by multiple credible sources to be a capstone cover for a secret, city-size, underground facility near the tiny community of Balsam Grove in Western North Carolina.
             </p>

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              <strong>
               PARI actually is the first place I thought the man might be headed because of reports, which we've posted on this website, about caged animals and abducted children at PARI.
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              Here is a portion of a letter we received on May 13, 2011 that hints at mistreatment of children at the facility hidden beneath PARI:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               I worked for Transylvania County Department of Social Services and Child Protective Services and then later Henderson County Department of Social Services.  I can tell you that this story gets worse than just animals in cages at PARI.
              </p>
              <p>
               I had two different Satanic Ritual Abuse cases, and both were immediately taken from me and swept under the rug. The State Bureau of Investigations even covered up evidence.
              </p>
              <p>
               I am ex military and not scared of much, but what locals told me during the investigation was that I needed to be very careful, as I was not from the area originally.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               During World War II, the U.S. military created personnel Redistribution Centers, which provided rest and recreation for military combat personnel returning to the United States from overseas service. The centers also operated in order to reassign military personnel just returning to the United States to new service locations and/or units.
              </p>
              <p>
               In Asheville, North Carolina, the U.S. federal government rented three of Asheville’s main hotels and the basement of the Asheville City Auditorium to operate as the U.S. Army Fourth Service Command’s Army Redistribution Station (ARS). Officially, it was known as the Army Ground and Service Forces (AG &amp; SF) Redistribution Station, Asheville, North Carolina. The housing facilities that were a part of the Redistribution Center included: the Battery Park Hotel on Haywood Street; the George Vanderbilt Hotel; and the Asheville-Biltmore Hotel.

            Rafael Guastavino, a Spanish architect known for his patented tiled timbrel arch design died in 1908. He had designed the vaulted ceilings, including the pool at the Biltmore. Examples of his work are all over Europe and lots can be found in NYC.  Maybe a collection of photos of his work may provide some clues for this post. The absence of a drain is weird but maybe it was tiled over once the place became a museum and the pool was drained. This would prevent rats from coming into the house via sewer lines.

             said above maybe it was tiled over when it became a museum? That would also prevent these paintings being 100% proven.

              The estate has gone through great pains to keep everything as close to original as possible.  Why would they cover over a pool drain.  If there was a sewage leak, and I were a preservationist, I would say pull the drain, plug with foam, pour 3" of concrete on it, put the original period drain panel back in place.

               i would think just a few matching tiles would be needed to superficially cover the drain to prevent creep-crawleys surprising a visitor witb camera in hand. The drain wouldnt need to be disrupted. I use a round barbell  to cover the drain opening in my small horse barn. should I ever need to use the drain, I just set it aside.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is a wild guess on my part. We need a Pizzagate contingent to visit this place and report back!

                That was the point of my restorative fix - plug the drain with semi permanent, non-degradable material (polystyrene and concrete with a galvanized mesh layer mesh layer (rodents can chew through anything)) and top it w' 3" of concrete.  Removes easily if needed.  Leave the original drain grate in place.

                  Consider vanishing points and intersecting lines while painting or drawing something.  Sometimes, when setting up an architectural drawing, it's easier to pick intersections and lines which work for the drawing you are setting up.  It isn't always perfect.  Artistic license is sometimes involved.

               Maybe it was never a pool? Is there any photos of it actually being used as a pool? To me it looks like a weird/creepy fuckin pool design..

                I agree, yoj would suffocate from chlorine fumes but it was mentioned that it would be filled for guests then drained the same day. but where would guests hang out and relax and mingle.  It is very utilitarian. I mentioned earlier that it might be connected to horses, horse water therapy or something. horses love water, and that might explain the rope bridles.  How big were the stables at Biltmore, were they training race horses?  The bridle trails were extensive probably the greatest amount connected to a grandhouse anywbere in USA.

                Is this pool near a barn, was butchering going on there. These estates were often self contained like a plantation. This is  simply not a pool for socializing IMO.

                 What else is interesting is the lack of steps at the bottom of that ladder!! I mean even if there was water in the pool you would think that they would make the steps go most of the way down.. Almost as if it is so kids cant get out. I'll add this to the post

              To me this seems like a drain, were all the water/blood has settled the longest, maybe that's caused the tiles to discolour? Also seems there could be a drain further up but could be a missing tile.

              I'm assuming you are talking about what looks to be a 1" x 10" gap behind the conduit.  It "could" be, but there is no way to clean it out or access it with the conduit in the way.  I'd be more likely to think it is grout and tile which may have fallen away.  The cracks in the tile look like settlement cracks.

               Actually I thought they were referring to the round, silver colored metal plate with perforations in it, that is under one of the lights.  But like you said, access to a drain there would have been blocked by the conduit, even worse than where the gap is.  Even if that particular light is not original, as the base of it does not seem to match the other lights' bases, the conduit still would have blocked access to a drain there.  Great point.

                The round silver colored piece is the socket base.  You could call that an escutcheon, I think.  I don't see anything plumbing related.  Even for the Victorian period.  Not a lot of photos of swimming pools to compare it to.

                  Honestly, I'm trying to find more information on period pool construction.  The estate had indoor hot and cold plumbing, so there is no reason to think that they couldn't have built in a drain.  Sand filtering was already in use at the time, so the technology was there to support a freshwater circulation and filtering system.  The estate had a boiler which means they could have powered a pump system.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Doesn't make much sense...

                   I read or heard, I think on a Biltmore site, that the pool was heated by steam.

                   If anyone is interested, this 8-page document discusses pool heating of that time, including by steam and by condensation collected from steam boilers:

           <p>
            I thought I should mention the popes' (former) pool also because I have not seen it posted yet on v / PG or v / GA.

             who would want  to go 3 miles underground just to reach a winery. the house was built before prohibition, when was the tunnel built? Is the tunnel large enough to accomodate horse and wagon? I can just envision the elite having their favorite mounts brought to the estate and prey brought in using the tunnels for hunt parties. An area of research might be  any correlation between publicized grand parties at the estate with satanic holidays.

             Underground Asheville: Exploring passages, purpose beneath city -
             <a href="https://eu.citizen-times.com/story/entertainment/2015/10/28/underground-asheville/74236848/">

             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Vance Pollock, Asheville historian and frequent right-hand man to local occult expert Joshua P. Warren, said there's enough evidence to support the notion that underground Asheville existed.
             </p>
             <p>
              "It helps lend credibility to some of the more mysterious rumors and outrageous claims," said Pollock, who with Warren runs the Asheville Mystery Museum in the basement of the Asheville Masonic Temple as well as Haunted Asheville tours. "But criminal activity, prostitution and bootlegging ties in with that."
             </p>
             <p>
              "The police would raid a still or barroom and take all the illegal liquor downstairs to what would be the evidence room, impound it, and smuggle it through Westall's Lumber, which is now Pack's Tavern, into the police station never to be seen again," he said.
             </p>
             <p>
              As for where the rest of Asheville's tunnels led, or for what purpose they were created, it's hard to say for sure. "I think they were mainly utility; certainly, they were there at least early after World War I, and I have evidence of some of those places," Pollock said.
             </p>

            Hi
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Zzzmmm333">
             @Zzzmmm333

            ,
           </p>
           <p>
            great find! I would to ask you to please add an intro paragraph to the post, so that people who don't know the story about the Vanderbilt story and the paintings will be able to understand your links.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, please point out that the pool shown in the painting
            <em>
             might
            </em>
            be the Vanderbilt pool, since it looks very similar, but since the tiles are different, it is not yet clear that it is really the
            <em>
             same
            </em>
            pool.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you!
           </p>
           <p>
            I will give you a 24 hours Grace flair, so that you will have some time to edit.

            <p>
             as Kiernan chronicles in “The Last Castle,” her new work of nonfiction, Biltmore was a financial catastrophe, even for someone with the wealth of a Vanderbilt. It took Vanderbilt’s widow, Edith, to salvage Biltmore for generations to come
            </p>
            <p>
             I first saw Biltmore when I was a teenager.
             <strong>
              My father was stationed in Fort Jackson
             </strong>
             in South Carolina and my mom drove my sister and me up to look at the house. ... It really made quite an impression on me as a kid.
            </p>
            <p>
             There were a lot of things I came across. ... Some were trivial but fascinating, such as
             <strong>
              Edith’s family’s role in the creation of the teddy bear.
             </strong>
             I never saw that coming.

            Ah, so that's the connection between teddy bears and the Vanderbilts and pizzagate.. Also, 
 a book on the historical context of the house.. thoughts of another UK mansion and its WW2 military connections came to mind - Bletchley Park- so, what would this 'historian' have in the pages of that book...

            Nope, written more like a soap opera than a historical document of the estate' history.  Given the author is a daughter of a military man, I found that interesting.  Maybe some of the estate's secrets are being kept firmly under wraps?  Looking further afield...

               <p>
                The king of all the wild animals was the deer, and more precisely the hart, which is an adult male of the red deer. The hart was classified by the number of tines, or points, on its antlers. An animal should have at least ten tines to be considered worthy of hunting; this was referred to as a "hart of ten."[3] Deer could be hunted in two different ways: par force ("by strength" and hereunder par force de chiens ("by force of dogs" )), and bow and stable.

                <p>
                 For years, the locals have watched the shooting parties coming and going from Foxcote House, a glorious 17th century stately home on the edge of the Cotswolds.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Mr Wexner flies his American family and friends into the Cotswolds estate by helicopter for shooting parties each autumn. He has built a giant hedge around Foxcote House to shield it from prying eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                 He runs his business empire from a non-descript office building in Columbus, Ohio, but once a year in time for the shooting season, Mr Wexner and his entourage travel to the Cotswolds and decamp to Foxcote House, built in 1740, which sits atop a hill close to the honeyed stone village of Ilmington, Warwickshire.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Mr Wexner has largely succeeded in keeping his ownership of Foxcote out of the public eye despite the fact that he bought the estate 18 years ago for about £3m.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Wexners fly in to the estate by helicopter for the annual pheasant shooting season each October,

                 There are no coincidences.  The frequency of the color is almost identical.  Nice find.  I bet there is more.

              Im shocked at the resemblance of this boys face to Anderson Cooper. He has been easily trussed with those odd swim ropes. Typically you would see ropes on a side of a pool or hanging on the wall with life preservers attached where you would fling out the rope and haul the swimmer in as the swimmer held onto preserver.

               I also thought that if it is indeed AC then could we possibly match any of the other kids in the paintings to people of his age and similar job? It's a long shot but could possibly be done and also the one with the older folk in the gym, maybe match to photos of previous owners?

             The agency isn't an allegory for the CIA. There's episodes where Archer bitches out a CIA agent (Slater) about MkUltra abuses.
            </p>
            <p>
             The tweet is wrong, too. It's not Season 01, but 05.
            </p>
            <p>
             In season 06, there's mention of Q clearance (again, Slater).
            </p>
            <p>
             Season 07 makes mention of incest in wealthy families... In the alternative universe, Cheryl Tunt is rebranded Cheryl Vandertunt.

             Maybe some focus on trying to find a building with an entrance like the one at the other end of this pool, pictured in the video at 1:20 - 1:26. I don't know enough about the Vanderbilt place to know if that has one; anyone?

               the pool was renowned when it was built for its underwater lighting, noti ce how their are no windows, no source of fresh air, a watery dungeon. Its not at all aesthetically pleasing or a welcome place for a swim on a winters day. It is hideous.

                Are there any images of the pool with water in it?  I know the lighting was supposedly the first used of submerged electrical in a pool.
               </p>
               <p>
                Your comment about no source of fresh air or lighting makes me think that maintaining a pool like that would be an absolute nightmare for mold and mildew, including all of the tile up to the peak of the tile ceiling.
               </p>
               <p>
                Maybe it was never supposed to be a swimming pool.

                 I am highly suspicious of this pool, they had all that land, there was no need to put it underground.

                 But just to add, this might be a fan:

                  If I had unlimited land and money, I'd build an in-ground outside with a glass structure over it with fans, ventilation and moving panels.  And if you want to be cutting edge for the 1890s, heat the pool and heat/cool the air.

             <p>
              "Season 5 of Archer follows the Archer cast as being the most inept drug dealers in the business as they are secretly hired by the CIA to take 2,000 kilos of Cocaine, turn it into crack, then sell it to inner city residents and start the late 1980s crack epidemic. They fail spectaturaly because one character, Pam, starts a coke habit that has her eating half a key a day. More gets lost when their resident scientist, who built a submarine in a swimming pool using coke as ballast, gets upset that it will never have a maiden launch blows up the sub along with the coke."

            I agree, that looks almost identical to the Vanderbilt pool barring the location of the door, the plants. Ropes are identical.

               Adam Reed apparently connected the Vanderbilts to Archer through not only the Biltmore pool in Asheville, but also via the Cornelius Vanderbilt II House in NYC:

              I agree with user
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/137">

              that the paintings were most likely done from photographs (probably commissioned by the Vanderbilts).
             </p>
             <p>
              The thought occured to me when I realized that the artist is about the same age as Anderson Cooper, who, we speculated, could be one of the kids in another painting by the same artist.
             </p>
             <p>
              If the painting indeed shows Anderson Cooper, then the painting cannot have been done while he was a kid.
             </p>
             <p>
              Someone on another thread about the Vanderbilt estate said that maybe the wealthy families involved in torturing and raping kids do photographs of the torture sessions / SRA sessions, and then commission artist to do paintings, and keep these paintints as kind of trophies.
             </p>
             <p>
              Actually painting on set would take too long imo.

               Ah yes that would make more sense obviously lol So they take their photos, then then they get the sicko artists to paint them, then they burn the photos thus leaving no evidence jiut their "fine art" aka victim collection. Sickos

                 It was me that made the comment about the elite having itinerant or hired artists they favor, likely pedos themselves, to "capture the moment".  Probably a painting from a photo, but that doesn't mean they didn't experience firsthand.

                  Re the firsthand experience: The artist, born 1973, is from former Yugoslavia, where she seems to have experienced the atrocities that happened during the wars in the 1990s firsthand (mass rapes of women and children), or as a close observer. That seems to have been her initial motive for painting dead and tortured people.

                 <p>
                  The question remains if and how she might be involved in nefarious activities herself.
