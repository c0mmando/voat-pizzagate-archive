            I recommend approaching the whole thing by first emphasizing that a sexual nature and symbolism are being used, and then pointing out how children are then included with the same nature and symbolism in the same content.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think too often the message isn't clear enough, and comes across more so like, "Look at these people with their weird, kinky art, isn't it terrible and satanic?!?!?!" Like most people are not going to care if someone is into some weird shit, and will just think it is a matter of some prudish conservatives who think anything weird or kinky is omg Satan. Have seen threads and videos around the web who show something and then encourage people to be disgusted but don't approach in it an ELI5 manner, which sadly most of the public requires if you want them to get it. Remember you have to lower the bar quite a bit to help pierce through the heavy wall of cognitive dissonance, not just expect people to draw their own logical conclusions.
           </p>
           <p>
            A lot of people I've spoken with online and in person about the instagram stuff, for example, are not putting it together in their minds that pizza was clearly used as sexual symbolism with and by adults, and then pizza 'jokes' were being used with kids, after it had been established that pizza was sexually symbolic to those people, and therefore there was sexual symbolism being used with kids. Instead they just see it as, "Those people are into some weird stuff, but that doesn't mean anything."
           </p>
           <p>
            You have to really spell it out in no uncertain terms to help people understand that you're not just witch hunting gay people, kinky people or trashy edgelord artists, but rather there is a logical thought process taking place when determining that there are less than subtle hints of child abuse themes in the material.

            I would like to know if those bands had an unusually large percentage of child/teen related names, but that would require the entire set to get a properly unbiased result. Teen Mom, The Coathangers, etc. I remember there were quite a few. It's possible that the band selections were used to subtly indicate what the real business was, in connection to the strange illustrations that definitely were gory beyond normal. And one of the seemingly benign posters had exactly fourteen fish on it, reminiscent of that one picture of Podesta showing his palms. Naturally some of the bands would have been chosen on quality, but some of the bands playing at CPP were very bad indeed...

            How much of this weird dark hipster shit has to do with the heroin problem? I think it's all connected in the end. The same people/governments that traffic people traffic drugs.

            I would say yes, the "art" and crap that has come out of looking into Alefantis's list of friends and associates has been more damning than even the emails...especially given this place is unbelievably advertised as child/family friendly.
