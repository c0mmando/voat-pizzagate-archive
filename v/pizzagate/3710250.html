            I saw this the other day and it makes you stop to think...
           </p>
           <p>
            Bloomberg spent 500 Million dollars on launching his campaign.  There are only 300+ million people in the United States.  Bloomberg could have gifted a Million dollars to every person in the country and really helped a lot of folks.  Of course, it would likely crash our economy when supply could not keep up with demand.  But just as a thought experiment... something to think about.

            I would hope, as I have after 25 years of digging, felt very disheartened by the general public's dismissal of the truth regarding not just pedophilia but ritual abuse, the torture of young children and the adrenochrome epidemic which is becoming more and more clear.That good people coming forth revealing these truths have been murdered, traced followed and blacklisted (oh I know all about that one) and silenced. I wonder what it will really take for people to open their collective eyes.I write this,sitting here having lost everything for simple wanting to now who did this to my children and why did the establishment,namely the entertainment business, work so hard to shut me down and destroy me. I at present, have little hope in humanity.All the work that some of us have done to bring this into the light and the price many have paid. There is a secret army of perps, spies and deep state goons that have been deployed to silence and destroy us. If it is true that what some people are saying, that Trump is using the Corona Virus to take down the deep state that would be great but sadly, really, I just wanted to know what happened to my children all those years ago. I would gladly die with a smile on my face if at long last, the truth came out. In Canada we have, unfortunately, Trudeau, who I briefly met and who is a s spineless as they make them. You can almost see the puppet strings attached to him and the Soros-Rothschilds puppet masters. Canada where a recent truck shipment of Adrenochrome was apprehended but no word what came of it.Canada, oh Canada, where all the crooks and pedophiles roam around freely. Pathetic Canada, where it is (if you can imagine)  still dialed into their MSM and drinking the cool aid. The Frank Giustra's will most likely never be taken down,unless it is an american court-case. Canada, land of the weak and apathetic.To successfully take down the US deep state they better consider exposing the scum in Canada because you watch, if it gets too hot in the U.S. they will be running to Canada,the safe haven for pedophiles and evil creeps.Honestly, wish I never came back here. I never knew how bad it was until Trudeau got in(which was obviously fixed) and then he got re-elected, all the while polite Canadians said almost nothing.

              There, you happy?? What are you, the grammar police? Often when in a stream of consciousness state I first and foremost, am committed to getting the thoughts out Same used to apply when writing out treatments for screenplay ideas, just getting it out there and then later, if I want to, l making the adjustments needed.Some of the grammar and errors I have seen on here are atrocious but I am forgiving as I understand people are trying to formulate their ideas or thoughts.
             </p>
             <p>
              As an aside,my girlfriend is a real stickler with spelling and grammar and when she initially reads something I have written she cringes at my mistakes. However later, when she reads it in the context of what I was writing she understands.Keep in mind as well, some of us here have P.T.S.D. and being hyper vigilant when writing something down can be almost impossible.

               Shouldn't be a problem going back and editing in, after the stream of consciousness.  Assuming that you intend your writing to be read by others.  To be clear, it's less about the mistakes than the lack of paragraphs.  With that mini wall of text the lack of space between sentences just intensifies the problem.  Maybe no one will point it out to you, but I wanted to read it and it was not worth struggling through the wall of unedited consciousness.
              </p>
              <p>
               If it's not intended for others and is just theraputic for you, that's okay too.
