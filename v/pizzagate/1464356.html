<p>It doesn\'t look like this event is officially sponsored by CPP, but it has gotten pretty big traction on Faceberg in the DC area. Might be worth digging into who is organizing the event as well as people who are interested and or attending</p>
<p>It is publicly hosted by Erick Sanchez: <a href="https://www">https://www</a>. facebook.com/therealericksanchez/, a PR guy for Frontier Solutions <a href="http://www">http://www</a>. frsdc.com/who-we-are-/</p>

             Could be a good opportunity to scope out the building, bring a battle buddy, an anon went to check out a location pizzagate related,nothing heard back. New thread got drowned in shills saying he was a larper.
