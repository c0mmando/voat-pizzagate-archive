<p>The FBI give much higher priority to investigating CP and abductions, than child prostitution because prostitution is classified as &quot;significant violent crime.&quot; </p>

<p>According to CACU officials, the FBI’s mission and resource limitations cause child prostitution to rank as a lower priority. <strong>The FBI categorizes non-cyber crimes against children as violent crimes, which currently rank eighth on the FBI’s overall priority list.</strong> For crimes against children specifically, child abductions are given a higher priority than child prostitution related crimes.120</p>
<p>Endnote 120: A Supervisory Special Agent assigned to the CACU at the FBI headquarters expressed the opinion that a prostituted child should also be elevated to the status of a “child in imminent danger” and receive immediate attention. [obviously a dissenting opinion]
