<p>Points of views supporting a false flag theory:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the video topic &quot;What Comey Was Investigating, Explained&quot; claims that the producer had knowledge of what the former FBI head Comey was investigating. <strong>FBI or Comey sharing such information to a third party organization would be odd, if not illegal.</strong></li>
<li>Second, the video report is so obviously biased that it just can\'t be about FBI investigations. It doesn\'t handle any other related persons connections to Russia except for the president Trump and people close to him - one of the missing persons in this matter is John Podesta himself. <strong>I don\'t think that FBI would have left other persons out of such investigations</strong>. (Or if they did, the investigation itself was biased.)</li>
<li>Third, after three minutes, the video starts to handle an old birth certificate case. This has nothing to do with the topic or Comey or FBI, indicating that the true meaning of this video is not to present any investigations by Comey, but more likely to brownstone the president of the United States</li>
</ul>
<p>It\'s clear that Donald Trump, and many influential persons within the political and business elite have ties to Russia, some stronger, some weaker, depending on their businesses and interests. Trump gathering international investements during his hotel building era was surely interesting also for Russian investors, both the honest ones and less honest ones.The interpretation shared on this video doesn\'t look at the case from this obvious perspective, but instead focuses on the investments from Russia, at the same time showing they play a minor role compared to investments from other countries (e.g. Germany).</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, any evidence for Russia having a role in the election 2016 was completely missing also on this video. </p>
<p>Quoting the familiar group of liberal mass media (CNN, Buzzfeed, Politico, WaPo...), this video flagged that Comey was fired by Trump because of investigations about Trump-Russia ties. Unfortunately, CAP didn\'t manage to hide their propaganda flag well enough. </p>
<p>One of the high voted comments below this video puts it all together well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One problem, no tangible proof. Butt-hurt liberal propaganda.﻿</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, what I\'d like to see from CAP is a report on why Clinton fired the head of FBI in his time. Now that would be interesting.</p>
<p>The only connection on this video to pizzagate is the comment section below the video. I should add one of these comments to at least to try to follow the rules here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or.....what makes more sense.... is Trump is trying to drain the swamp, and all the swamp monsters are coming out in full force to try to stop him. Too bad they will fail because despite efforts from the propaganda media and the child abusing monsters, the people are waking up to the truth. #Pizzagate #Pedogate﻿</p>

            There's more connection to Pizzagate than the comment quote you mention. The Moscow Project was deliberately set up as a single issue propaganda machine: Trump/Russia AND to establish a citizen based computer program like VOAT/PIZZAGATE, inviting the public to search the Internet for evidence against Trump.  (Hmmmm, some interesting opportunities here for the opposition)
           </p>
           <p>
            The Moscow Project video presentation acknowledges the recording of 20 known contacts the contents of which are presumably  damaging to Trump but does not get into specifics.And who did the recording?
           </p>
           <p>
            These 20 contacts are itemized in a chart. Could you please freeze frame that chart and append it to your post?
           </p>
           <p>
            I think this post was important and I'm disappointed there was little interest in it. Good job.
