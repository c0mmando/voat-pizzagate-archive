<p>Hillary Clinton was “extremely warm and comforting” and seemed to know a lot about Seth, Joel said, which “made us feel good.”</p>
<p>The Riches plan to meet this morning with detectives and the Washington police chief. Joel said he “absolutely” believes that it was a random crime.
He said the police “have been extremely helpful and caring about the family.”</p>
<p>The Riches learned last Friday afternoon from the Clinton campaign in Omaha that the presidential candidate wanted to meet them. Monday morning, <strong>the couple were told that photos would be taken.</strong></p>
<p>When they got to North High for the photo session, Joel said, “We found out that the secretary had requested that we be the last ones so she could spend more time with us.” They showed Clinton a photo of Seth and his girlfriend outside the White House. <strong>Mary Rich said Clinton remarked on what a room-brightening smile he had.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Joel asked if the candidate would sign a photo for the girlfriend, whom he identified only as Kelsey from the Detroit area. Tuesday morning, he received the autographed photo, which included an expression of sympathy from Clinton.</strong></p>
<p>To me, it\'s just a whole new low for Clinton to sign a picture of Seth for his girlfriend. Oh, and of course Hillary had to have pictures taken! She had to look good for the public. Hillary thinks Seth had a smile that lit up the room. She seemed to know a lot about him? Oh please 🙄 These hurting parents are clearly being manipulated by these sick evil people who are giving them sympathy during a time of grief and weakness.</p>',

            Okay. Don't lose your in the midst of it all ... go slow .... anyway, you will find ultimately and eventually that discovering things we've heretofore been lied to about will actually help you keep your mind, your sanity.

            Definitely, didn't take me long to figure it out. Sandy Hook was well-planned, fooled a lot of people. Of course gun grab was the reason. Then they got sloppier like with San Bernardino and esp Orlando Pulse. It's a great trick of the perpetrators to use children w/ false flags, people will call you nuts because you're heartless because these were children! Every shooting of that magnitude, there's always people wounded too, they're never ALL dead. That's a clean sweep. Nonsense. And on and on, no security photos etc.
           </p>

            And guess what, the moon landings were a hoax too. Research it w/ a very open mind. I know a lot of NASA big wigs and some astronauts, but I don't dare talk to them about it. Of course, I sound like a nut, but people would be very surprised about what we've been fooled about.

            I'm sorry but something is very wrong with the parents  . As a parent you just know when someone has / had evil intent weather it be towards your child or anyone else in general and to ask for an autograph is truly demented . I guess you have to be a total sociopath though to meet with the family of a young man who was murdered by you ( or most likely her associates )  , smile in their faces while stealing everyone's money and keep  right on lying and feeling absolutely nothing ! How do people like this even exist ? I feel horrible for months if I hit a bird in my car or get back to much change at the store . I guess i'd make a horrible  politician, Thank God for that !

             You sound just like me. I couldn't even hurt a bird of even a frog. After learning about all of this, there is no way in the world that I would ever want to be in Hollywood or a politician. No amount of money or power is worth selling your soul. Not to mention, imagine having to look over your shoulder everyday, because if you piss people off or get in the way, they will off you. I would rather be a good compassionate person any day over all of this evilness.

             I really look up to Trump. He has the money, power and the fame. He could have retired and lived like a king the rest of his life. He must have balls of steel to become president and have millions of people hate him so much they would want him dead and have the world hate you. His life sure doesn't sound pleasant to me. Imagine the things he must know about some of these sick people that he would like to take down, but he keeps being attacked in every direction. I truly feel that he likes kids and hates pedofiles. That's just my opinion tho!

              I pray he really is trying . i did vote for him and before that I was a brainwashed Democrat I'm ashamed to say . It destroys me to think that I could have helped put some of these sick Pedos into office. It blows my mind looking back at what was right in front of my face that I could not see. I have this horrible sinking feeling though that its going to take so much more than President Trump being in office to fix what is wrong in Washington . I am so worried for my daughter and grand daughters future .

               Praying for him and our country sure sounds like a good idea to me. Most people are or were brainwashed because they believe what the media tells them. I feel for the kids too because it's getting more crazy by the day and it's really scary the thinking process these dems have.

              Well it's definitely based on the clintons. But I'd much rather have the underwoods in power because despite being power hungry and evil they still care about the constitution and doing a good job, they are harder to bribe too and do more of their own dirty work.

            Agree, but don't let Seth's dad off the hook for being a loser low life. Who the hell asks for an autographed photo at a time like that? It goes to show that things are not as they seem. And was Kelsey the honey pot used to spy on him? #drainthefuckingswamp

             I was giving the family the benefit of the doubt and figured they were just weird, but to ask for an autograph picture when their son was just murdered is way beyond bizarre. Maybe the Disney characters and the panda in the video mean something after all.

              Yeah, I don't know what's going on there. I did reach Seth Rich's favorite animal was a panda ... so maybe ... but it wouldn't negate what his dad did ... or his brother laughing at what his dad was saying. I hope this all comes out because it's beyond weird.

              It's bizarre. That father and mother are bizarre. Have no idea what went on there, but the way Seth's brother was laughing, everything they said must be one big bunch of garbage.

                I didn't think he was that upset. His mother either. I'm not going to judge that, though. Some people hold it together better than others, but the rest? The rest is absolutely BIZARRE!!!!

            How do we find Kelsey?  You'll know by her reaction if you contact him/her, if he/she has been coerced into silence. There cannot be that many white Kelseys in the Detroit area in that age range.  Less than 5 I bet.  Work your magic...

             Wasn't she the one that wrote on FB days after the murder about Seth being killed for finding double poling places.  The family are Starblind naive at best and super creepy Jew circling the wagons at worst.

             Michael Hastings was also murdered by the deep state at 25ish.  His wife didn't want to talk but didn't fawn over murderers.

              We could get into the purposeful dumbing down of Americans, and how that plays a role.

I don't really think most of our fellow Americans are that stupid - they are victims really.

                  I loved that. Then her body double comes out hours later, skinny and not at all sick, whilst the campaign claimed she had pneumonia, but that kind that goes away within a couple of hours. And they say it's Trump who makes the U.S. laughing stock.

               Oh geez. Another lie. Like the fake polls! I don't think these people realize that a lot of people are disgusted how they are acting. The news tries to make people think almost everybody hates Trump. In reality, these people are deranged if they think they could win. Especially her! I seriously hate her

                You and the rest of the world, except those like the media who benefit financially by propping her up. Soros and the powers that be are using her because she's female, and with the stupid woman-power movement they're pushing, they can run her using her gender alone, and actually use it to cover up all her crimes, because SEXISM.

                 I seriously wonder this. WHY do they keep running the same losers (like H) over and over again? They don't have any other trusted associates who can run? Or it's just Hillary's turn! And nobody has the guts or standing to tell her no?

                 Imagine if, instead, they'd pulled out a new Obama 2.0 puppet---a likeable Hispanic woman, say. We could be in a very different situation right now.

                  I think it's Hillary's ego pushing for this. She ran a really nasty campaign against Obama despite him being a deep state cypher and no threat to her (and her funders') interests. Her arrogance is her weak point and needs to be weaponised against her.

                  There are dozens of NWO lackeys lined up for future power the world over. Our prime minister in Ireland just resigned, and his presumed replacement is well known to have attended a Bilderberg meeting a few years ago despite being a relatively minor politician at the time

                   Wow, they've got you all stitched up in Ireland too. This mess really is worldwide. I wonder how it all comes down: all pieces have to fall at once, or...? What if American Pizzagate is exposed first, how will the rest of the world react? (possibly not realizing they have their own Pizzagate at home). Scary times.

                  People hate Obama too now, they see that he played us. We have Tulsi Gabbard and Nina Turner who could easily win, but the DNC isn't going to allow them because they're free thinkers and anti-war. They're truth tellers. I liked and voted for the Green Party this time around, and it felt better than any other vote i've cast, in fact all my prior votes were 'against the other guy' rather than for someone.

                  I think through the Clinton Fn, the Clintons have so much dirt (power) on pretty much everyone, that no powerful force is going to come against them, not even Donald Trump, who is actually their buddy. And since she's got dirt on everyone, they probably want o see her in power rather than in jail. Our only hope, I think, was Trump. And he just seems to be dropping the ball.

                   That's cool, we all should support more third-party candidates. Who knows how lines will be redrawn when the dust settles after this. I was a Trump supporter from the very beginning, before I was even really "awake." I believed he would bring down the ring, although I was beginning to lose faith the last couple months, especially after the strike on Syria. I am feeling pretty good again now, after the firing of Sessions and #SethRich. After all, what other hope do we have of a non-violent, bloodless revolution? (Although I will take up arms if it comes to it).

                   That's not to say I don't think Trump isn't compromised; clearly he is somewhat operating under the Deep State's rules and seems to capitulate to them at times. The Illuminati hand symbols disgust me (did Trump always pose for pictures like that before?)

                  <p>
                   Some theories: 
- 12D chess double-cross? 
- maybe Trump realizes he can't outright win yet, so he's buying time and maneuvering pieces into place? 
- Maybe TPTB have a trump card, like worldwide Ebola outbreak, they're holding?
- or yes, perhaps it's been a GENIUS mindfuck of a psyop from the start and we've all been duped into trusting Trump.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   But if that's the case, why are they trying so hard to remove Trump from office? Simply to divide us, start a civil war, and conquer over chaos? I once read some Illuminati theory/confession that they realize they fucked up by pushing too fast in this final stage, and NWO may now fail. This hasty decision was made by some old Grand Master who insisted he wanted to see the completion before his death. If they'd slowed down by one generation, they would have easily succeeded. Of course, now they're all in, gotta to see it through to the end, but I don't believe that recent events have turned out the way they planned, at all. They're panicked and making sloppy mistakes, like Seth Rich and this Russia hysteria that is growing so ridiculous it's starting to wake up normies and will soon backfire.

            The PRO-CLINTON, "grieving" FAKE Rich family -- who smirked on the day of Seth's funeral and sported PANDA BEARS -- MONTHS later suddenly want to find the truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, they go to MOSSAD agent George Webb, who disseminates copious disinfo.
           </p>
           <p>
            The RICH family are crypto Jews (camp where Seth worked is for Jewish kids; RICH is your first clue as well as names like "Aaron" and attending a JEWSUIT [Jesuit] school).
           </p>
           <p>
            George Webb, MOSSAD DISINFO AGENT, is part of this lie.

           <p>
            This whole story STINKS like a big pile of steaming bullcrap.

             since Webb is outing the intelligence operatives and shell corporations behind the Mossad right now maybe you should find another argument.
            </p>
            <p>
             Start watching his actual videos before casting judgement. He has made a clear arguement with facts on videotape, confessed testimony, FBI insiders, CIA insiders, etc. who are tired of lying and corrupting America. It is all coming to the spotlight including the murder of Seth Rich. Again his sources are the white hats inside the govt. leaking to him through drop offs of memory sticks, thumb drives and other communications like videotapes of alive toddlers being placed on crude surgical beds with trays placed under them as a hack doctor prepares to remove this babies organs.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the corner of that room is a stack of what they call in Syria "kidshells" these are the dead children who are simply a shell because their organs have been removed. 
The baby in the video is screaming for her mother as a child adjacent to her is having their chest and abdomen cut open to retrieve organs.
            </p>
            <p>
             Please do your research. You do not have much time to come to your senses.
