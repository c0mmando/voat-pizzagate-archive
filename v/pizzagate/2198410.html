<p>My opinion is that Julian Assange is dead based on various factors, all of which are not included in this timeline, such as supposed visits by Pamela Anderson, interviews with this one and that one, including the most recent one by Sean Hannity, etc., etc., etc.  To be completely forthright, however, I can come to the same conclusion based solely on the provided info.</p>',
