            Listen folks..if you were an evil elitist and had these tools, and the entire FBI and CIA as your beckon call...you would probably set up a HUGE blackmail file...you would want dirt on everyone.  Then you would use this info to blackmail when needed.  I believe, over the course of the last 20 years, both the CIA, FBI, and NSA were MAINLY tasked with getting blackmail info on everyone and that this become there primary mission.
           </p>
           <p>
            With that in mind, there has to be thousands of hours of video on almost anyone we have discussed on this board, probably in the act of murder or rape or torture.  When this breaks wide open, there will be lots of evidence...my 2 cents...

            I knew there was something fishy and not quite right about the sudden "Vault 7" bullshit. Dr Steve Poscheznic already admitted Wikileaks is just a mouthpiece for Intel agencies. He already said that after they got Trump in, they considered their work complete, no need for pedo arrests. Your theory seems absolutely spot on, and the conclusion is very sad indeed, we live in a world run by pedo protectors. For now....

             Why should we trust Steve Pieczenik? I don't know much about him and I've seen only two videos of him but in what I believe was his first video during the elections, he actually praised Kissinger. So I don't see why I would trust him.

              I don't trust him to tell us the whole truth, but when it comes to Intel leaking to Wikileaks, what he has claimed has checked out 100% so far; he does seem to be a mouthpiece for the Intel who are leaking, and who wanted Trump over Hillary.

            i'm with you, but how will the defense work?  meaning, will some elite say that the CIA (or other similar org) planted the CP?  obviously that won't work.  if you're saying that the defense will be that some random (or Russian) hackers have the same ability that the CIA has, yeah i think that will be the story and this hypothetical "defense" has been brewing a while now since the story that the russians hacked the election.  yes, these latest events - vault 7 leaked tools and the "fb killer"-- circumstantially strengthen the "i've been hacked defense" but not that much imo.  so i think there may be more to the fb killer psyop

             It doesn't have to be the CIA, or "the Russians" that "planted" it - it could be a "random hacker," or a "business competitor," or a "political enemy," or whatever. It no longer matters.
            </p>
            <p>
             My larger point is that it would behoove a lawyer to, in a court of law, PROVE that the capability to plant files on a computer even exists in the first place. That has always been the hurdle. This admission by the CIA/FBI now gives lawyers the capability to argue this point and offer a plausible alternate theory about how files ended up on their client's computer in order to surmount the "reasonable doubt" bar.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, for instance, if &amp; when files are eventually discovered on Alefantis' server, he could use this defense, for instance.
            </p>
            <p>
             Before, the FBI would drop a case before admitting that they had these tools (see the article I linked to in my previous post). But what changed? Cui bono?

              didn't the FBI drop the case you mention because they didn't want to explain how they obtained the evidence (not just that they had the tools?)    I understand re the "random hacker".  It will be interesting to see how this plays out -- interestingly if someone uses the defense, logically there would be pressure to catch the hacker because someone was in possession of CP -- almost would create the need for a patsy

               They didn't want to reveal their exploit for TOR. People still believe TOR is safe. The government created TOR so they can likely decrypt it. Would they really release a truly anonymous service for their enemies to use? I think not.

               Good points. I'm obviously conflating the "refusing to explain how they obtained the evidence" with "we have these tools to plant files." The article also talked about how the FBI actually ran Dark Web sites with malware-embedded CP on them in order to sting people, but methinks that since they were asked for ALL the source code, that disclosing the ability to covertly plant files was what they were really trying to protect. Trying to read between the lines a bit.
              </p>
              <p>
               But now they have effectively declassified Vault 7, so I am thinking this FBI/CIA ranting has all been kayfabe, and this was the goal all along.

               Thanks.

             If the OP is right, then Julian/Wikileaks was compromised back when his internet was turned off and some claimed he was taken from the Ecuadoran Embassy. I remember several Wikileaks staffers saying, on 4 chan I think, they've been compromised, then some codes were tweeted out.  Some thought it could be a dead man's switch and 4 chan was trying to figure it out.

             The thread was since archived, then can't even find it in archive anymore. Some SwissBro Chan claimed to have figured out the code, said it's something about UK/USA in reverse, someone else said something like "We're all fucked. God help us" then boom...silent.

             Here's the thread I asked about it because I can't find anything else on it

              This was the series of events that caused me to get me involved in pizzagate. After Vault 7, though, I was fairly certain the Assanges safety was not compromised, because why would the CIA expose itself like that? However if OP is correct then this is seriously worrying for many reason, especially the fact that the government can abduct people in a populous area and convince everyone it didn't happen...

               The only thing I can think of is that A) many people already knew about the spying, it just confirmed it &amp; with that leak being more techy related, some of it hard to understand B) possibly other sources had that info so CIA leaked it first  to continue the Wikileaks facade C) no investigations/arrest were made or an out cry from the public which is probably what they banked on. D) set up the scenario the OP just mentioned. I feel like with Pamela Anderson visiting Assange, it should be pretty easy 4 her to take a pic with him holding a camera with a date/time stamp for proof of life. I'm still 50/50 if he's in control or not. I don't even know when the last time was that he went to the balcony or looked out the window.
              </p>
              <p>
               All of that above is speculation but the one leaked info that surprised me that hasn't been a HUGE our cry is the Montgomery audio/ The HAMR info. On audio, it talks about someone was murdered that had info on Obama's fake birth certificate, 900 million USA citizens banking info lifted by the CIA and rigged elections in FLA. I mean, WTF does it take for the people to rise together?

                 He's alive and did a couple of live speaking conferences in Australia last month to earn money. Wikileaks clearly told people not to send anything to them as they had been compromised. I don't know why people are still doubting this.

            That's a good theory. I'm about 50% in agreement with you. The other 50% makes me think they did NOT release those hacking tools and indeed they were hacked. Maybe it's a bit of both. Why? Because taking down the Deep State will be hard, it's been there 50 years. They've tapped every electronic device on planet Earth it looks like.

            How would you take down a Goliath like that? You tell everyone that the CIA and FBI can see and hear everything. That would get some "fence-sitters" to finally stop using electronic devices lest they tip your hand. Vault 7 would get people to use human couriers just like in the old days. A good analogy would be to view Vault 7 as a

            Turning back the clocks is kind of a great metaphor for whatever the fuck happened to this country. We need to turn back the clocks big time b/c we're heading off a fucking cliff right now. Things were tough for poor people of all races in the 1950s. But Eisenhower wasn't running a robust cocaine and heroin smuggling operation to basically exterminate them and get rich doing it. Forgive the hyperbole but how the fuck else could George H.W. Bush justify inventing crack cocaine.
