            Whichever post you're referring to, if it stayed up, it either spelled out a connection between its topic and the Pizzagate investigation explicitly (rule 1) citing sources in the process (rule 2), or it slipped through moderation. I can't tell which of the two without seeing it, but none of these cases are relevant in terms of your post which does not comply with the submission requirements of this particular sub. I can't be any clearer than that. There are requirements for every submission, vetted and accepted by the community. We're not changing that because "everyone investigating can learn a lot from these documents". There's a place for that, and (unless you're willing to spell out, with sources, all the connections between Pizzagate and your documents one by one) it is not

            No, I'm trying to direct it where it belongs, and make sure that information is not only free-flowing but organized as well.

            is a sub dedicated to specific findings that further the investigation. Your collection might be useful to a researcher, but your post, as it is, is not useful as per the six simple rules of this sub. It is your responsibility, as the poster, to demonstrate the relevance of your content to Pizzagate, and cite sources for every claim you make in that process. That, in your case, would mean explaining why each topic you've just listed has a direct connection to Pizzagate, and sourcing these claims. Since I'm assuming that's a lot of extra work you might not want to put into this as it might not be worth it, I'm suggesting you resubmit your collection on
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             /v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            , where it will be welcome without that extra work.
