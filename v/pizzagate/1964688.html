            From Heavy.com -

           <p>
            However, the report deems it not likely that the Russians did it or that Rich was killed for allegedly being a leak to WikiLeaks (for which there is no evidence), unless evidence is produced that a toxin was used in the death (none has been; police say Rich was shot). Rich, who was shot in the back, did not die at the scene, the report says, and did not even realize he had been shot.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rich was shot and killed on July 10, 2016 at about 4:19 a.m. in the 2100 block of Flagler Place NW in Washington DC.
           </p>
           <p>
            The team’s central findings: • Seth’s death does not appear to be a random homicide. • Seth’s death does not appear to be a robbery gone bad. •
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Seth’s death was more likely committed by a hired killer or serial murderer. LMAO!
             </strong>
            </strong>
            • There may be additional video surveillance of the crime and crime scene. • The resolution of prosecuting the individual(s) responsible appears to be hindered both actively and passively. • Seth’s killer(s) most likely remains free with in the community.
           </p>
           <p>
            However,
            <strong>
             <strong>
              although the report says in the opening that its authors believe the murder was “more likely committed by a hired killer,” in other places they say that a professional killer would not have been likely to leave Rich alive, as he did not die at the scene, rendering that theory less likely.
             </strong>

           <p>
            They NEVER reveal WHICH evidence they had access to and reviewed. That is a HUGE red flag.
           </p>
           <p>
            Until there is a DEATH CERTIFICATE and an AUTOPSY REPORT, Seth Rich is NOT DEAD.

            “It took a group of volunteer students and graduates from George Washington University to dig into this unsolved case.... These forensic-psychology students and instructors made up the group known as The Profiling Project.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The wording suggests that they just all spontaneously got together and started digging into it. Not so.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jack Burkman, a Republican, contributed office space to the Project.

            From Heavy.com (link below)
           </p>
           <p>
            Burkman has made controversial statements on the case before.
           </p>
           <p>
            “I was approached by a guy who styles himself as a former U.S. intel officer,” Burkman said to the television station. “I quizzed him. I think he’s credible – you never know the motive of people. But what he said is basically this – that Seth discovered that the Russians had been hacking and therefore the Russian government did away with Seth.”
            <strong>
             <strong>
              There is no evidence to back this up, and Rich’s family has repeatedly decried conspiracy theories into their son’s death. Burkman has contributed more than $100,000 to a reward fund in Rich’s case.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The team describes itself as an “all-volunteer group of current and former George Washington University forensic psychology graduate students and instructors.”

             So true about the Profiling Project being a stunt by a PR firm.  One of their specialties is crisis management.  The client apparently NEEDS everyone to believe Seth is dead, and Glenn Selig and company is eager to help.  Seth's brother not being able to keep a straight face when he talked about Seth's "death" had thrown a wrench in the works.
