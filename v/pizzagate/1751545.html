             Oh, God.  I hope not.  I hope she can still be found.  But I have a feeling many will not be. I hope there is a special place in heaven for these little angels, and a special place in hell for the perverted heathens.  May they all meet a tortured terrifying violent demise.

               I have to believe that or I think it will depress me to no end. I also believe the elite many decades or even centuries stole the Catholic Religion.  They made up stories and inserted Nazis and Pedophile Popes and others.  They may have done that in other religions as well.  People need to wake up.  But those people will get theirs.  Of that I am sure.

                Let me tell you I read the PDF that was posted. It confirmed what we have here been discussing and yes I think they have hijacked or a better word infiltrated so many religions and organizations from the INSISDE. it is one of their tactics. Look at Alex jones they have been playing us all along. The writer compares it to good cop bad cop. It's long article and there is no way to know if it is true, but it confirms so much. :( I have not followed up on this little girl recently. At the time they said they found her body in a park. May god protect the children, it is a tragedy!!

                 I have plans to read it, but I don't know if I can.  After reading about Little Jane Doe found in St. Louis, I have problems reading these articles.  I have one friend that I have red pilled, she is an Irish Catholic (but does not attend Church) and is so very familiar with the Irish abuse cases.  She believes me entirely.  Another one is informed and knows, but is not a pizzagate member.  I believe if we start red pilling as many black people about these #missincdcgirls that they will be stirred up enough to protest and demand results. We also need to let them know that we will be right out there with them.  The bigger the crowd the better.

                  Absolutely! It is definitely spreading. So many people are getting concerned! That article that I linked it's long but I found it fascinating. It wasn't so much of gory details, but rather a person explaining the workings of a secret society and how they interact. It is helpful and explains so much about everything that is coming to light. Even the manipulations. I see the Alex jones apology in a clearer light. Missing girls is helping get the word Out. So many people left and right from all kinds of background are unifying on the missing girls.

            This was a very bizarre story in DC in 2014 that got a LOT of local attention at the time.

            This was a weird story.  A so called Janitor basically took a girl from a homeless shelter and no one in her family reported her missing until her school did after a month of absences.  Rumors around here was they gave the girl to this guy for what ever....drugs or money.  When she was reported missing the so called suspect went on the run first killing his wife then got suicided in a park in DC.  Lots of people seem to pick parks around DC to get suicided.  Vince Foster, Sandra Levy and this dude.

            This story never made sense...the girl is still missing...I kind of think she likely got snacked on by the Satanist.  The so called killer seemed much like a Renfield....a person being paid to bring them kids.  But he didnt cover his tracks well enough and the Pedo Cult took out his wife and him to cut off any loose ends.
