<p>“Pull over, I’m about to throw up.” My wife was driving our SUV as I occupied our daughter Cyra while cruising in the back. I had just given away the biggest story of the year, and the biggest story of my career, to BuzzFeed. I couldn’t relax and couldn’t sleep, because a story of this magnitude is a career making even at the highest levels of journalism. Well…Why did I do it?</p>
<p>Plan A was simple. I’d run the story about Conyers myself. The Democrat-Media establishment hacks at CNN would attack me. They would call me a fake news conspiracy theorist. This would be saturation coverage, making me the biggest story of the week.</p>
<p>I would slowly release my sourcing on the story, until, at the height of the attacks, I would show all of my cards. The media and Democrat establishment would be humiliated. It’d have been Breitbart v. Weiner 2.0, and I’d be a superstar.</p>
<p>Plan B would be to tip off someone in the mainstream media to this story. If a mainstream outlet breaks this story, Democrats are required to answer the story. They can’t use their usual smear tactics. They can’t say, “We don’t respond to conspiracy theorists like Mike Cernovich!”</p>
<p>By going to the media, my reasoning went, the information gets out. This is how to hold Congress accountable, and demand they unseal their hidden record of sexual abuse.</p>
<p>I couldn’t give a big story CNN, because CNN lies about me, they defame me, and they never give me the opportunity to defend myself. They are the worst of cowards, taking shows from behind the TV while refusing to give me the right to reply. Vice is fake news, and The Daily Beast is helping a stalker lead a harassment campaign against wife and daughter. WaPo and the NY Times aren’t that bad, actually, and they’ve stopped lying (for the most part) about me. But Maggie Haberman once refused to give me credit for a scoop, so that disqualified the NY Times.</p>
<p>BuzzFeed seemed like a great outlet for this story because they’d be likely to work the entire weekend to get it out. BuzzFeed worked tirelessly on it (I assume), and no we did not coordinate. I tipped them off and they did the rest. What they did is none of my business and I take zero credit for their work.</p>
<p>Conyers’ behavior is part of a larger pattern of cover-ups led by Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Senators like John McCain and Jeff Flake.</p>
<p>I had to stand up for what’s right, and that’s why I tipped off BuzzFeed to this story.</p>
<p>Congressmen can literally rape women, and these women have no civil recourse. They are sent to hostile star chambers where due process is limited, and thereafter the victims of Congressmen are sworn to secrecy.</p>
<p><strong>How Congress covers up sexual misconduct by its members.</strong></p>
<p>According to data released to Reid Wilson of The Hill, Congress has paid out as much as $4 million per fiscal year to women abused by Congressmen. Although these settlements are paid with taxpayer funds, the settlements are kept secret from the public.</p>
<p><strong>We are demanding that Paul Ryan release EVERY one of these settlements.</strong></p>
<p>I could have taken the glory, gaining tremendous fame for myself while humiliating my enemies in the fake news media. But if I took this path, the story would have been about me, rather than these secret settlements totaling tens-of-millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Or I could set my ego aside for the greater good. The story will now be: WTF? Why are these settlements kept from public view?</p>
<p>Rather than let the Democrat-Media establishment continue to cover up these horrific sex crimes by powerful members of Congress by attacking me, they must address the charges against Conyers and others.</p>
<p>Plus, I still got credit for handing off the story. Everyone in Congress who didn’t know my name knows it now.</p>
<p>Remember me, Congress, I did this to you.</p>
<p>Remember me, Congress, I am coming for you.</p>
<p>It’s now time to call Paul Ryan’s office. Call your Congressman or Congresswoman. Demand that they #UnsealTheRecords</p>

            This is what the message is getting translated into with a stab at pizzagate included. This is a divide men and women narrative. Anti-patriarchy. Standard noise. Fox is running with this, Al Franken's fake stunt, and old news Bill Clinton whom they could bust today if they wanted to. Bill is taking another one for the team.

            Where is the child trafficking news? You don't let child rapers continue to operate so that you can condition the delicate feelings of the public before you handle the situation. You handle the situation so that children do not suffer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Convincing us that the public needs to be "conditioned" before children can be saved is a cruel joke.

             I don't doubt that this could be a designed coverup, that's generally the way shit goes. I do have a counter argument for this though..

             When there's the potential for a bunch of kids who are stuck in these rings to be killed to eliminate the evidence, you have to be very careful how you approach things. For instance.. If that was really Madeline McCann sitting at the table playing cards with Podesta, what are the chances she's still alive?

            There is so much to the power of John Conyers. I remember he ruined the election fraud hearings of 2004 with a known whistleblower who created vote flipping software for touch-screen voting machines.
           </p>
           <p>
            When it was time for The Whistleblower to testify John Conyers told the hearing to continue while he left the room because he had to pee! You see what he didn't hear as the chairman would never matter! I knew from 40 years before that as a child growing up outside Detroit after the Riots of 67 and they rebuilt downtown with Joe Louis Arena and the Renaissance Center, it was found that all of that was built with heroin money taken for the heroin trafficking that got into the United States ports through Canada. They said well the heroin didn't stay there it was moved out around the country a big pile of money was always left for allowing it to come in. After the election fraud hearings I learned about the pedophiles. I knew that scumbag Conyers was one of them! It is important to get him removed whether he abused children or adults.  Conyers has brought much rot to the country including stolen elections and dope!

             I thought this interesting -
            </p>
            <p>
             "Q Anon: 4,10,20 - Meaning: Going through the door, cup of victory, destroy your enemies. In the New Testament sense: “I will deliver you enemies unto your hands”.
            </p>
            <p>
             Keep in mind that POTUS’ enemies are watching the Q posts as well. For centuries they have communicated with each other in plain site, with their symbols and coded messages. This is their language. Trump is trolling them in their language, for their benefit."

            Fuck you buzzfeed. So now we can parade around some old geezers playing grab ass on taxpayer money (yawn) and in the same breath say that pizzagate is fake.

            Not to mention that this article has nothing to do with pizzagate.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The documents were first provided to BuzzFeed News by Mike Cernovich, the men's rights figure turned pro-Trump media activist
             <strong>
              who propagated a number of false conspiracy theories including the “Pizzagate” conspiracy
             </strong>
             . Cernovich said he gave the documents to BuzzFeed News for vetting and further reporting, and because he said if he published them himself, Democrats and congressional leaders would “try to discredit the story by attacking the messenger.” He provided them without conditions. BuzzFeed News independently confirmed the authenticity of the documents with four people directly involved with the case, including the accuser.

              I didn't see any rape unless I missed it. The take home message I got was "congressmen waste money playing with women and in some cases made inappropriate advances."

              While denying pizzagate. Seems like a good way to make noise and deny pizzagate. I think its designed to muck up news channels with a narrative they control. Al Franken, Bill Clinton again...

              Where is the child rapers? We don't see them. And I don't buy the "we must condition the public first" for a minute because that is a lame ass dragging lie.

              Do you get the feeling that whoever is dripping these revelations out bit by bit is deliberately creating a pressure cooker -- starting with pizzagate, and now slowly turning up the heat with all these pedowood and all these sexual assault/harassment items?

               I would need some sort of medical explanation for why millions of people would stroke out because they found out people in government, whom they already do not trust, were involved in child trafficking.

               Another thing I know is that coup's do not start by leaking it to a social media platform because it would make it incredibly dangerous for the "good guys." Coup's are done in secrecy.

               It really started with Cosby.  Most people men especially we're not believers.  But now with so many in Hollywood and government being exposed as predators, that really softened up the masses for what's going to be the ultimate reveal.  The pill will still be hard to swallow for some

               Yes, This has occurred to me.It is a possibility that this is all being released slowly for the purpose of controlling the ultimate prize, so to speak which would be The Red Pilling of the Masses.  If all this was released slowly instead of dumping it all on people at once it would be a shock to the system.  With slow release the public will be more ready to accept the shocking (not to some) revelations of sexual abuse, rape, trafficking etc. of adults and children.  This is a hard pill to swallow for some.  But much easier when done drip by drip by drip by drip.

                  Where was Q "planning in public"? I read it all from beginning to end yesterday and didn't see that. More like explaining how things that have already happened connect. Other than the martial law hints, which he said were necessary disinfo.

                  How? How would they do that without discrediting themselves and playing right into the "Trump is a dictator ignoring the rule of law" meme? They have to win back the trust of the American Public, not just take down the Cabal.

                   Open that database of proven evil. File charges. Prove guilt. Put people in jail. There is no need for dragging all this out with years of "indecent approaches toward women by men" narrative. No further evidence needs to be collected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The evidence is in the database treasure box of horror. Use it today if they are serious. I guarantee you that will boost public trust and all of America that is not passed out asleep will cheer from the rooftops.

                  yes but, if they pull the plug on the MSM Trump looks like a dictator ... also, the MSM is pulling the plug on itself w/out any outside help imo.

                   Maybe, but the MSM is owned and staffed by the Hollywood/CIA/ and zionist billionaire class. We would have to expect them to pull the plug on one of their greatest assets. I am skeptical that they are willing to do that.
