            Except it's not actually being used for anything Covid19 related at all.
           </p>
           <p>
            Snopes lays out the misconceptions around this quite adequately, though I'm sure I'll get plenty of indignant "SNOPES BAD!" responses for even so much as suggesting that people calm their farm and read their take:
            <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bill-gates-id2020/">
             https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bill-gates-id2020/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Snopes is no more a dubious source on this than someone playing it up as the biblical end times. Given also that rags like SgtReport are pushing this guy's ramblings, it calls into question the quality of the source and makes it worthwhile to read other takes on the matter.

             Snopes is wonderful at conflating stuff for the non-critical thinker.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              From a factual standpoint, Gates has never proposed or funded research into the development of a vaccine — for COVID-19 or for anything else — that includes the injection of a device that could actively track your location, monitor anything you are doing, or “control” you.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             That's word salad of a sentence.  Of course there is no documentation for Gates funding vaccines
             <strong>
              to control people.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             professionals and scientists don't speak in those terms.
            </p>
            <p>
             Gates has been funding vaccine research for many years.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation did fund a pilot study conducted by MIT and Rice University researchers into a potential vaccine-delivery device that could impart an invisible mark detectable by a smartphone. This study was theoretical, the technology described was passive, and the device was incapable of any sort of tracking or monitoring.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Pity they didn't cite the paper or the years.  I can't be arsed to go looking for it because I know Gates funds vaccine research, funds tracking technology, funds nanotechnology and works with DARPA.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The basic premise behind a digital (or decentralized) identity in the context of Gates’ work is simple: It would involve some sort of cloud-based storage of medical and/or personal-identification documents accessible only with the consent of the owner but available anywhere in the world. Crucially, such a concept, whose central scientific challenges are in the realm of encryption and blockchains, has nothing to do with anything injected into the body.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             There are separate patents.
            </p>
            <p>
             Snopes also goes on and on about how he doesn't plant to inject blah blah blah.. here's one of the Gates backed vaccine companies:

              Novavax, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to delivering novel products to prevent a broad range of infectious diseases.

              Actually you're parroting rhetoric spread by subversive users (I knew it wouldn't take much to make you show your colors on that one) who have consistently tried every tactic imaginable to censor and ostracize me for daring to go against the grain when something doesn't add up. I've been quite clear about what I am and am not. Even if I were a Satanist that would have no bearing whatsoever here.
