<p>What I was saying is, in the movie spotlight, those guys needed to have some substantial evidence (court documents) before they were able to publish their news findings for the public of pedophilia in churches.

People joke around, people say dumb stuff, but I think there\'s a difference between saying and doing. </p>
<p>The people here are doing great job, but I feel we are going in circles. What are your thoughts? What is something we can do to really push this out so people don\'t think it is a hoax? I think this is why mainstream media is saying pizzagate is a conspiracy.</p>
<p>EDIT: Should have said pizzagate feels like the movie spotlight that was released in 2015 for the title. Here is the trailer: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwdCIpbTN5g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwdCIpbTN5g</a></p>',

            Personally, and I know many will disagree with me, I think the first step is to prove to the general public that cheese pizza is code and the code is used for networking on the internet. Examples of this network are everywhere. They may not directly link to CPP, but just showing how much cheese pizza crap is on the internet and how much of it will lead to f'd up photos as well as known pedos would do  a lot in convincing the general public that child abuse and the exchange of pedo pics is a lot more common than people think. Also, I think getting the Epstein story out there would do a lot too. The guy was openly into 12 y.o to 15 y.o., his story was actually (though scantly) covered by MSM, and he's friends with the elite, but most of the people I know know nothing about this. This is what will diffuse MSM's fake news narrative since the public will see traditionally verified stories that were largely blacked out from MSM's narrative.
