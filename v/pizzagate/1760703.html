                At least you admit the evidence is real. You're just cynical and think no one will be arrested.

                I disagree obviously and that's because Trump isn't part of the establishment. That's why they hate him so much. They can't control him.

                 trump stands alone. everybody is working against him. the only thing you can say you know is fact about trump is :
1 he is rich as fuck and rich fucks like to keep their money. 2 he has no political experience which makes him an infant in comparison with hillary.
                </p>
                <p>
                 i say that the "evidence" for a big part is not really usefull in a trial.
i say even if you have a few good cops , judges,lawyers,etc , then still the bad guys have the upperhand . the establishment have known 
&amp; participated in trafficking since forever , so you need to handle this differently ; you need to create "chaos" by protesting worldwide.
the way most of the pizzagaters are "thinking" nothing will really change &amp; allot of the guilty will not be punished. 
maybe you still havent pickedup this little fact : in 1994 policereports state that 50% of the WORLDECONOMY is in hands of criminal organisations. 
we're now 2017. do the "math".

                  I can tell by your English you're not American. You don't have confidence in government and that has led you to believe nothing will happen. America is different. We have a long History of killing political leaders. I can assure you the perps will be arrested. If they're not then people will buy assault rifles and form militias and kill every living organism inside the beltway in DC twice.

                  They know it. Trump knows it. The Bush and Clinton Crime family know it. The Constitution knows it so well they wrote the 2nd Amendment for this very reason.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  That's how I know there will be arrests. This psychotic clown pageant  is coming down one way or the other.

                     i told it before , im (myself not belgian )from belgium. so there's some experience here with humantrafficking &amp; corruption in government.

                     <p>
                      "usa is not different....its even worse".........I totally agree. The USA is orders of magnitude worse. Just look at Vietnam, Kosovo, Iraq and now Syria, all prove how evil and psychotic the USA is.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Here's the thing, that insanity cuts both ways. Yes the USA's wars are bigger but so are its civil wars. The last time we had a Civil War in the U.S.A. around 500,000 American soldiers were killed. That's more than all the soldiers killed in all the wars America has ever fought in combined.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      What we are seeing today in America is the prelude to Civil War v2.0. Hopefully Trump understands that. I think he does because he's not part of the government. That's why they're trying to sabotage Trump at every turn. They're terrified they can't control him. He's going to bring their party to and end. In that case Civil War v2.0 will be mostly bloodless. Only a few at the top with hang from the gallows. In Hillary's case she might get a firing squad. I haven't made up my mind yet.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      If they get to Trump before then it's all over. Then Civil War v2.0 will be bloody. But again I doubt it will be anything like v1.0. The reason is the rank and file within the military are as fed up as the rest of us. You've got to realize how many Navy Seals Killary killed. It's now into double digits. Then all the other soldiers she's "sold down the river".
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      So Civil War v2.0 is coming up very soon. It won't really be that bloody and this giant psychotic clown pageant will end, finally. Then the world will pick up the pieces. I strongly suspect the U.S.A. will be paying reparations to a lot of countries. They'll have to.

                       i believe i read today in the "newspaper" that your gov at the moment is the richest ever to be in the white house.
trump has no political experience , but he has allot of money , just like the ones that are "against" him.
how do you know they are terrified of trump ? you read it where ? or seen it where ? 
msm no? but msm is used to pull a false view of the world over your eyes no ?
have you seen the truth about khadaffi ? if not , please do yourself

                       you talk about the amount of us soldiers fallen in combat in all the wars ever fought ,

                       i must say us never had a ww in their own backyard , and to me this seems the reason americans are so easy to go to war or give their consent for war.
                       <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/us-has-killed-more-than-20-million-people-in-37-victim-nations-since-world-war-ii/5492051">
                        check the casualties made by usa worldwide
                       </a>
                       i think europe has been the blueprint for what is going to happen to usa , they changed your laws , they took your guns , they changed your healthcaresystem,etc
the real changes will probbably begin when hillary takes her turn in the white house after trump made "everything worse" and then those changes will be applied worldwide.
therefore the people from the world needs to make a move. money cannot be the answer (money = power = corruption), for nothing will change. we need to act in such a way
that the whole of the world feels and notices the changes .

                        That's a GOOD thing. Trump's wealth makes him beholden to no one. He can't be bought off.

                        You'd have to be here in America to see it. Every piece of the MSM media is out to get Trump. Do you know what a "full court press" is in basketball? The MSM is doing a full court press to get a Trump. They wouldn't be doing that unless they were scared shitless. To give you an idea of how utterly absurd things are here in the U.S. of A. take a look at this:

                        This is like the third of fourth error you've made. You don't have much credibility left. No they haven't taken our guns. You can buy all the assault rifles you want. The only thing they've done is outlawed high capacity magazines. That's good if you're trying to stop the next Adam Lanza. It's actually a blessing if you're creating a militia to bring down to DC and clean house. High capacity magazines are a great way to run out of ammunition real quick. ;-)

                         error ? is this all a test ? lol what i meant with they took your guns ; not that they really took all the guns from every person, but they changed laws &amp; stuff no ?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         how much credibility was there in the first place ? you never told me in the first place :)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         i know television &amp; media in usa is way more pumped up then here , but maybe the msm wants everybody to think 
that they dont "like" trump ? isn't there some law that prohibits this kind of behaviour against a head of state ? ( think erdogan from turkey for example )
isn't the government allowed to bring "news" according the narrative that fits them best &amp; doesnt necessarily reflect the truth ? i think theres a videoclip
with president bush in which he more of less confirms this. so you admit you let yourself be led by the msm ? how credible is that ? did you vote ? if so , why ?
choice is an illusion created between those with power and those without. if no one voted , they would'nt be in power in the first place ! they need us the people
to keep their illusion intact. maybe you should use those assault rifles on your government instead of using them against people in countries where 
usa no business has in the first place , like for examle libya i hope you saw that video i mentioned earlier.

                          No, they just added more regulations like background checks. That's meaningless because if it comes down to Civil War v2.0 the people buying guns won't have criminal histories.

                           i know i dont live there :) and i do not want to lecture you at all ! 
look , for example , me myself i never voted in my life and im sure there in usa there must be people who also never voted.
but clearly, this voating happens on a large scale , so still allot of people think it really "works" . here in europe its the same , so understand no lecturing here, relax.
this seems to be something "normal" to do. and it seems that "normal" as in socially acceptable , as in governing / government , contains things like humantrafficking,
pedophelia, torture,extortion,corruption,etc . so maybe you should start thinking beyond "normal" ? again no lecturing , just facts.
if they added regulations , then they changed or altered the laws existing no ?
again i do not want to lecture you or anyone , really dont feel so attacked, but if you want change , you have to see some things differently , if not , history will repeat itself.
now please go see that video , really its very informative. you get a good idea how the msm works , its really intresting. :)

                            I watched part of it. I understand its message and I agree with it. I'm not fan of Qaddafi but whatever is in Libya now is 100x worse than anything he did. And the only person responsible for the mess in Libya today is Hillary Clinton.

                            George Webb goes into great length describe how Hillary Clinton was running weapons from Libya to Syria. And she killed Ambassador Stevens when he found out about the human trafficking and Sarin gas precursors were being sent to Syria too.

so next time you do not vote again ? :) 
what i wanted you to see the video for was to see the people themselves GOVERNING  their country.
they had no democracy but something that is explained in ghadaffi's green book or

                             .
they had free education , they had a piece of the sell of their oil , they bought cars with 50% discount,etc.
ghadaffi even wanted to have africa a currency backed by gold ! 
this could be an inspiration to have a new kind of system for the people &amp; by the people. everywhere.

                              I believe everything you're saying. The problem with Qaddafi or any Arab dictator for that matter is they couldn't see the traps being set for them by Bush Sr, Bush Jr and Hillary Clinton.

                             <p>
                              They thought they needed to pick a fight with America in order to get respect. I don't know if it's something about Arab culture, maybe the weak horse vs strong horse thing, but they've never heard of "Speak softly and carry a big stick."

                              They misinterpreted George H.W. Bush "speaking softly" as weakness. The exact opposite was true. Saddam Hussein and Qaddafi willingly provided the rational for being attacked. You don't stick your chest out to George Bush or Hillary Clinton. They're both cold blooded killers of the first order.

                             <p>
                              I hate both of them with the heat of a thousand suns but you have to call a spade a spade. All the Arab bluster got turned into an excuse to give to the American people when they questioned another war in the Middle East.

                             <p>
                              You have to tip your hat to the pure genius of Bush and Hillary Clinton. They were always about 10 moves ahead of anyone in the Middle East at all times. You all walked into every trap they ever laid for you.

                               its pretty bad that when a country interacts with usa they have
to expect traps i think. did you know that saddam hussein wanted to donate money to us elections at the time, because he did not want war ?
theres a woman who wrote a book about it , cant find a link directly.
