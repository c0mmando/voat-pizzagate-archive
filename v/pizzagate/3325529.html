              Thanks for the link, both Yunus' brother Muhammad Ibrahim, and the Mohammad Ibrahim, are connected to Yunus.  I know this veers off topic about the title, sorry.

              Setting aside Yunus' brother and CMES... there's a lot to learn about the interconnections with "Mo" Ibrahim, Yunus, Clinton Global Initiative, Soros/Rothschild and Madeleine Albright.

              In the almost 10 years since it launched, the Hult Prize has deployed more than $50M USD of capital into the sector, mobilizing more than one million young people to take action as it continues to foster disruptive innovation on college and university campuses.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               What would you do with $1 million USD in funding to help change the world?
              </p>
              <p>
               This is the question Hult Prize winners answer every year. Founded in 2009 and sponsored by Hult International Business School, the Hult Prize was the idea of an enterprising MBA student at Hult, Ahmad Ashkar. Ashkar wondered—what if we challenged young people to crowdsource ideas to solve the world’s toughest social issues?

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Christine Maxwell is an Internet content pioneer, best known as the creator and co-founder of Magellan, one of the first professionally curated online search/reference guides to Internet content.[1][2] In 1992 she also created and then co-authored one of the first hard copy reference guides to the Internet: New Riders Official Internet Yellow Pages[3] and The McKinley Internet Yellow Pages;[4] both published by Macmillan Publishers in 1994 and 1995 respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
             After Magellan was acquired by Excite, (a competing search engine) in 1996,[5] she went on to co-found Chiliad:[6] a software company involved in the advance of on-demand, massively scalable, intelligent mining of structured and unstructured data through the use of natural language search technologies.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The firm's software was behind the data search technology used by the FBI's counterterrorism data warehouse.[7]
             </p>
            </blockquote>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Maxwell was an Editor for Pergamon Press Publishers in the early 70s.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Maxwell sisters sold out to a another Internet search-engine company, Excite, for about $18 million. When Excite was sold last year, the value of those shares had risen 1,000 percent.
            </p>
            <p>
             An Israeli e-mail company, CommTouch, hired Isabel as president while Christine launched another Web business, an Internet publisher named Chiliad.
            </p>
            <p>
             Meanwhile, Maxwell’s sons, Kevin and Ian, rounded up private investors in the United States to create Telemonde, a company involved in the complex business of buying and leasing telecommunications bandwidth. The company went public last year but has suffered setbacks in its efforts to make an impression on the Nasdaq stock market.

             McKinley Group Ousts Its Chairman and CEO
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The McKinley Group, publisher of the Magellan Internet search directory, has ousted David Hayden as chairman and chief executive and named computer industry veteran Kenneth Grunzweig as acting head of the company. Hayden will stay on as a consultant during a transition period.
           </p>
           <p>
            The moves came amid increasing signs of serious financial trouble at the 3-year-old Internet publishing concern.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hayden is a co-founder of McKinley and the husband of Isabel Maxwell, daughter of the late British publishing magnate Robert Maxwell.
           </p>
           <p>
            Isabel Maxwell and her twin sister, Christine--along with Hayden and Christine Maxwell's husband, Roger Malina--formed McKinley in 1993 to publish one of the first Internet directories. They launched the Magellan Web search service in September 1995.
           </p>
           <p>
            McKinley received investments from Internet companies, including Netcom, and formed strategic alliances with AT&amp;T, IBM, Microsoft, Nynex, Europe Online and others. But the company missed out on a frenzied round of public stock offerings this spring that saw rivals Yahoo, InfoSeek, Excite and Lycos go public.
           </p>
           <p>
            In late April, McKinley announced a plan to acquire Novo Media Group, a privately held Internet content developer based in San Francisco. But according to Novo President Kelly A. Rodriques, the acquisition is on hold, as is a round of much-needed private financing contingent on the merger.
           </p>
           <p>
            McKinley executives won't comment on the Novo deal or related financial transactions. Grunzweig comes to McKinley from TravelNet, where he was president and chief executive. He has held executive posts at Lotus One Source and Aldus.
