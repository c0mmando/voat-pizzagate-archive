           <p>
            Thank you for the post.  I'm starting to think about Sawyer a bit more.  At first, I thought he was solid due to his ST6 association.  But I know other people - including one CT expert who frequents CNN and MSNBC - who was turned.  He was also "at the Pentagon on 9/11".
           </p>
           <p>
            All it could take would be a honeypot, a long time ago, in foreign land to turn even an operator.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Knight's Templar cross is used frequently in military and paramilitary circles.  I wouldn't place a lot of weight on this.
           </p>
           <p>
            About TX....that could be a red herring as well.  The Rep/Sen (I don't remember) was a D, I think.  So who knows what the truth is there.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a former ST6 guy, his skills were highly sought.  Given the last admin, and Sawyers age, he would have been in prime money making territory.  Protecting DoD and S VIPs is top moneymaker.  I wouldn't hold him accountable for his protectees.
           </p>
           <p>
            Someone made a comment about the skull just sitting out on the ground.  I agree there.  I would have thought they would have left it where they found it.
           </p>
           <p>
