Well, turns out there was someone who didn\'t deserve his war medals, but it was Sanders. According to Navy Times, the secretary of the Navy stripped Sanders of a Silver Star he was awarded in 1992 because &quot;facts and evidence surrounding both the incident for which the award was made and the processing of the award itself&quot; have come into question. &quot;Additional information was brought to light after 1992,&quot; a Navy spokesperson told the paper. &quot;Those facts could have prevented the award of the Silver Star at that time.&quot;</p>
<p>What could those facts be?

            Wade Rowland Sanders, who served as a deputy assistant Navy secretary under Bill Clinton, and was busted for child pornography 2011. John Kerry is also a friend of paedophile Jeffrey Epstein

            . John Kerry's employee, paedophile James Michael McHaney (former aide to Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash), plead guilty to a federal child pornography charge in 2008. Mr. McHaney was found to be in possession of over 1000 child pornography images as well as DVDs portraying children as young as three being raped by paedophiles.

He was fired from his job as a scheduler for Cantwell after his arrest last year. Earlier, he had worked for the 2004 presidential campaigns of Democrats Dick Gephardt and John Kerry.  …  Police … found child pornography in his car and home. He was initially charged with attempting to sexually exploit a minor, but pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of possession of child pornography. Prosecutors said he had more than 1,000 images of child pornography [on a portable flash drive], as well as videos and DVDs portraying children as young as three engaged in sexual conduct. … The FBI arrested McHaney when he arrived for the meeting. He was fired from his Senate job hours later. As part of the plea agreement, authorities seized McHaney's car, a 1999 Honda Civic, as well as two laptop computers, a Senate-issued BlackBerry and several DVDs and videos, among other items.»

              «According to court records, Sanders admitted that on or about May 2, 2008, he possessed a computer and computer media which he knew contained over 600 images of minors, including one 21-minute video file that depicted several prepubescent females engaged in sexual conduct with an adult male and performing oral sex on one another.  United States Attorney Karen P. Hewitt said, “… [T]he defendant possessed and distributed hundreds of very graphic images of young children being abused for the sexual gratification of others.…”»

             They're the worst from a moral perspective. But, lacking moral boundaries allows them more freedom to become the best at playing the power game. The people willing to do anything to get ahead are harder to stop than people with self-imposed limits.

              I don't see it that way. "Get ahead." I see it as imprisoning themselves to an ugly fate. These people go their whole lives without ever knowing what it is to have a friend. What it's like to help someone without expecting anything in return. The best parts of life are forfeited for them. They're victims of a self-imposed crisis. It's a sad life shrouded in soft and silky drapery.

                  There's nothing hard about making money. With 250k you can buy a license to print your own in the form of a Federal Charter. If you grow up with parents that can lend you some cash, you're basically set for life unless you're a complete idiot.

                    They're only scattered from your perception. It all ties in together. To be king of a pile of shit, you have to stand in shit and surround yourself with it.

                    To create something beautiful out of a pile of shit, that takes drive and desire along with a clear perception of reality.

             Lots of suggestions that those propelled to the top are moved in gradually but purposefully and often family involvement.
John Kerry act re "Vietnam" and his testimony before Congress which was near poetic - all an act?
Very much of what we see is theater.  Very many questions of false flag violence to overturn Youth Revolution and to suggest that Hippies were dangerous -- i.e., Sharon Tate Murders which may have been military operation according to Mae Brussel one of our most brilliant investigators.  Evidently Sharon Tate's father was CIA.  Manson had long been in prison and Brussel points out that he was well-financed and presented as Hippie though obviously not.
Still looking for the specific articles by Brussel on this, but here's an introduction to Mae Brussel's work.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              "I realized that in this country we had a revolution--of housing, food, hair style, clothing, cosmetics, transportation, value systems, religion--it was an economic revolution, affecting the cosmetics industry, canned foods, the use of land; people were delivering their own babies, recycling old clothes, withdrawing from spectator sports. They were breaking the barriers where white and black could rap in 1967. This was the year of the Beatles, the summer of Sergeant Pepper, the Monterey Pop Festival, Haight-Ashbury, make your own candle and turn off the electricity, turn on with your friends and laugh--that's what life was all about."
    Mae Brussell died of cancer a few years ago at the age of 66. Somehow it seemed appropriate that mourners at her funeral were discussing the possibility of a conspiracy behind her death.** After all, hadn't she been in the middle of investigating satanic cults in the military?** If Mae were alive, she'd be glad to show you her file on CIA experimentation with cancer. You want names of such victims? She would get out a list. "Jack Ruby... Martha Mitchell... William Casey.... " She would give you a copy of a study by Texas researcher Penn Jones showing that, of more than 100 unusual deaths of witnesses in the assassination of John F. Kennedy, 27 key witnesses died of cancer within six weeks after the death of the President.
    Mae died seven weeks before the 25th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination, when she would likely have received a token of the honor and recognition she so richly deserved.

             NYPD Detective Jim Rothstein also points out military involvement in pedo-scandals not often enough mentioned.
Here's the interview of Rothstein by Prof. Jim Fetzer.

             Part I is about all you need, but as I recall it at the very end she is discussing members of 
Council on Foreign Relations.

               Thank you -- Have listened/read to a great deal of her shows/articles, but can't find the 
specific two I'm looking for.  I know both were TEXT and I've been over articles a few
times and can't find them.
I'd highly recommend Mae Brussel to anyone who comes upon this message.
Thank you again!  :)

                 Thank you -- she has another article where she lists all of the musicians - some w/family involvements with MIC/CIA and their deaths.  But don't think I saw what you put up and will read it.  Actually, I haven't had time to go thru all of the MB articles as yet.  Nice to find another fan of Mae Brussel.  :)
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you're interested in false flag stuff, 9/11, Boston Marathon, etal -- which I think MB may have been the first to predict -- (besides summertime shark events and also now moving to walking alligators eating children at Disney) -- Oel Dammegard is breaking down all of them.  Now that they have total control of visual via TV, much easier than having to do the real thing.

               Thank you very much for the info and I will follow as soon as I can.
But I'll still be looking for the two articles by Mae Brussel -- odd how you can see something in a

Will try to remember your user name.  :)

                I just saw that name for the first time on
                <a href="https://pieceofmindful.com/">
                 https://pieceofmindful.com/
                </a>
                .  Or maybe it was a link off that site.  I didn't read the whole article but evidently she was in to deconstructing the false narrative way back when.
