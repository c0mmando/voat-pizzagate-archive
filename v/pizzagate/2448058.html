           <p>
            The timing of Alex Jones's apology is due to Texas law and the timing of a letter he got from Alefantis's attorney.  Before you sue someone for defamation, you have to give them time to retract their statements.   They have to make a retraction or apology within 30 of you notifying them that they have defamed you
            <a href="https://www.emedialaw.com/2013-texas-legislature-watch-retracting-the-defamation-and-notifying-about-the-hack/">
             https://www.emedialaw.com/2013-texas-legislature-watch-retracting-the-defamation-and-notifying-about-the-hack/
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Jones didn’t say what prompted his apology but it may have been motivated by a letter Alefantis wrote to him in February. The letter demands an apology and retraction for InfoWars’ postings about Pizzagate; it does not threaten legal action, but refers to what Alefantis describes as “defaming” comments by InfoWars.
            </p>
            <p>
             But the timing of Jones’s apology suggests he was concerned about a potential lawsuit. Under Texas law, the Austin-based Jones had to retract or apologize for the stories by Friday — one full month after receiving Alefantis’s letter — to avoid exposing InfoWars to punitive damages in a libel suit.

             Do you disagree with the idea of organizing a protest to raise awareness ?  Feel free to repost this, since you have more credibility,  and I will remove this since you're so skeptical.

               Projection is a classic tool of shills,  and your weird rejection of the idea of a protest to raise awareness for a cause you claim to support, is very suspicious.

                  to say it more accurately: I believe that there is not nearly enough evidence to back up
                  <em>
                   any
                  </em>
                  of the pizzagate claims. I made my case for why there was not
                  <em>
                   nearly
                  </em>
                  sufficient evidence against Tamera Luzatto and you didn't even bother to read my comment because I disagreed with pizzagate. and you also didn't provide any content from the actual blog when I asked about it. you simply ran and hid from the conversation

                   Ok maybe I should have not refused to read your comment, but I just went over it then. Tbh if you are legit you seem to be very much in denial about this blog, especially the "joke" about uncensored pictures in a blog linked from another that claims to provide access to "raw and uncut" time with a baby, which you apparently have convinced yourself that's a common phrase and not at all possibly inappropriate (damn!)... If it were just the blog alone and didn't have such strong and direct ties/history/connections with king suspects Hillary and Podesta, maybe you'd have a point.

                    you're editing your comments all over the place. But in regards to your last lines, I'm not necessarily denying any of the
                    <em>
                     evidence
                    </em>
                    I'm simply asking you to be clear about where that evidence points.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Look at the evidence, not the claims. If you think Tamera Luzatto's blog tagline sounds inappropriate then call it inappropriate. But I'm afraid you're working backward from the claim and trying to prove it. Simply because there is evidence
                    <em>
                     toward
                    </em>
                    a claim doesn't mean there's evidence
                    <em>
                     for
                    </em>
                    a claim. For instance here's a claim: the sun is a giant firefly. Evidence for the claim: the sun and fireflies glow. How closely does that evidence get me toward proving my claim? What does the evidence really say about the claim?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Also you're falling into the trap I mentioned in the other comment thread of running away from one claim when pressure is put on it. You say that you could see my point if it was just the blog but it's also all the other stuff about hillary and podesta. But this is seriously clouding your critical thinking. You're building you're case on a mass of extremely superficial evidence and thinking altogether it must mean something.  I can provide a bunch of positive evidence towards proving fairies exist but it doesn't mean shit if the evidence is shit. I'm telling you focus on
                    <em>
                     one part
                    </em>
                    of the pizzagate claim and really think about how much evidence there is for it.

                       Because it's exhausting and a waste of my time and energy. I deal with enough simpletons on Twitter to be playing games with you. This is my last message to you. Literally everyone who has looked deep into pizzagate and who know it's not "fake news" agree that the Luzatto thing is one of the most damning finds of all. Your arguments are pathetic and fruitless and I'm done with you in this case.

                    My main point about the Tamera blog and most all of the pizzagate claims is summed up in the first part of that comment:
                   </p>
                   <blockquote>
                    <p>
                     Which is not to say that the phrase is definitely innocuous but if something sounds odd say it sounds odd until something substantive can be found.
                    </p>
                   </blockquote>
                   <p>
                    I just want you to think about actually what is the evidence for any
                    <em>
                     single person
                    </em>
                    . Really pick any person you like and bullet point the evidence for them. For Tamera Luzzatto it is
                   </p>
                   <ol>
                    <li>
                     The tagline to her blog :"Evelyn  is growing up, soon she will be the Queen of the entire US of A, right  now, for a limited time only, you can spend some time with her online,  raw and uncut. Take advantage of this now, as in the future she will  have the power of life and death over you.    ".  Which I'm guessing your claim about that line would be that it isn't a joke? I don't know that sounds like a really silly argument but I'll count this as evidence while also noting that I have never seen anyone provide evidence from the
                     <strong>
                      actual blog
                     </strong>
                     of any wrong doing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                     The 'uber' email which people here think she is explicitly stating that she is delivering her grandchildren to be some kind of pedophillic entertainment. This again heavily relies on a use of a phrase being malicious instead of joking. And the practicalities of the theory has many, many holes.
                    </li>
                   </ol>
                   <p>
                    Really look at the evidence for this stuff, it might surprise you how little there is. For instance would it surprise you to learn that there is *
                    <em>
                     absolutely no proof
                    </em>
                    that the emails contain "known pedophile code words".
                    <em>
                     And
                    </em>
                    that John Podesta, who is supposed to be a kingpin in this theory, never even mentions a single one of these claimed 'code words'. In fact in the
                    <strong>
                     decades
                    </strong>
                    worth of emails he only ever types the word 'pizza'
                    <strong>
                     one time
                    </strong>
                    and that is in response to someone else talking about pizza. And that the only phrase that is actually known to be tied to child pornography (cheese pizza) is
                    <strong>
                     never
                    </strong>
                    mentioned once in the thousands of emails.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Look at the evidence and think about whether the claims are appropriate.

                     I don't give a shit about the pedophile code or the nonsense claims that the msm ran with (and the only thing they ran with out of everything, to make the whole thing sound ludicrous) that HRC and Podesta were running a child sex ring from CPP, that you love to latch onto for some reason. Take all that shit out of the equation and we've still got plenty to go off.

                      wait could I just have a clarification here. Is it true to say that you don't believe there is proof that there are pedophile code words in the emails? also would you say that you don't believe there's evidence that a child sex ring was being run out of Comet?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      This is pretty surprising to me since that is the core of the pizzagate theory. Maybe you weren't around here in the beginning but I promise that people here firmly believed those things and that wasn't a media fabrication.

                       I know I'm breaking my rule of replying to you. As far as the claims in the very beginning about Comet running a child sex ring. I was here and it was never as if everyone was claiming this to be fact, something along those lines was thrown around as a possibility for a few weeks by some people but that was it, surely you can wrap your mind around that concept. Why are you so focused on old outdated claims that a few people might have thought possible at the very start but never since? As for the codewords in the emails, I would personally say there is some code going on in some of the emails yes, I wouldn't say we have 100% proof it is pedophile code, but even if we were to concede that all the code was innocent and totally not pedo code, it all becomes quite trivial when stacked up against the mountain mass of other circumstantial evidence we've found. Just for example, did you know that Hillary Clinton's former Chief Of Staff had a blog in which she advertised a 6 month old baby for "Raw and uncut" online time, and it linked to another weird blog where it advertised uncensored pics of a naked baby for premium members? Oh wait....

                       <p>
                        Also your description of the comet pizza sex ring being something a few people threw around as a possibility is
                        <strong>
                         100% wrong
                        </strong>
                        . It's also confusing to me why you would say that if you were really here in the beginning. Pizzagate started with the suggestion that there were pedophile code words and quickly became
                        <strong>
                         heavily
                        </strong>
                        focused on comet pizza and james alefantis. Where do you think the name Pizzagate comes from? If you want I can provide you with a slew of examples that would show what pizzagate was all about in the beginning. Not for a short time, not claims by just a few people, but specific accusations of child abuse against specific people which went on and on for months.

                        Also you keep pointing back to that blog, in your mind what does that blog title show to you? And the uncensored baby pics thing is not apart of that blog, it is also
                        <em>
                         clearly
                        </em>
                        a joke but you're making the same mistake over and over. You're linking extremely flimsy evidence together that are
                        <em>
                         barely related
                        </em>
                        . But you have never said what you think that shows.
