<p>In one of the most disgusting cases ever to come across the radar of the Free Thought Project, a police officer has been sentenced to 16 years in prison after he was caught by his fellow officers—raping a baby. The now former cop, 48-year-old Dean Roberts filmed himself abusing a helpless infant while on duty. He then distributed the footage to other pedophiles in a messaging app. His fellow officers caught a different pedophile—also a government employee—who had received the horrifying footage and then traced it back to one of their own. The former officer from the South Wales police department was then arrested and it was discovered that he had been plotting with other pedophiles to jointly abuse other children to make and distribute more footage.</p>
<p>After his arrest, this vile police officer admitted to rape, sexual assault of a child, possessing and distributing indecent images of children. “I can never forget the knock on my door and my whole world just falling apart,” the mother of the victim said in court. “It was just like being hit by a bus. We will always have to live with the consequences.” What’s more, Roberts’ partner in crime was John Guess who happened to also be a state employee. According to reports, Guess was a state attorney who worked for the Welsh government as a legal adviser.</p>',
