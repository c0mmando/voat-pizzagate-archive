Flynn was charged with a SINGLE COUNT of making false statements to the FBI.

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/01/politics/michael-flynn-charged/index.html">FROM CNN</a>: Flynn is being charged for making false statements, <strong>but not for any improper actions during the campaign</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Flynn\'s being accused of speaking with Russian Ambassador about how they and others around the world were leaning in a vote for a resolution about Israel, NOT for trying to influence or sway American voters in the 2016 election.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>FROM the same CNN article: According to an FBI statement, Flynn communicated with then-Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak after being asked by a senior Trump transition official t<strong>o find out how foreign governments stood on a coming UN Security Council resolution about Israel</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Trump FIRED Flynn. Trump didn\'t trust him because he lied to them about his own actions. What actions? Speaking with foreign nationals, including Russian Ambassadors. Why does that matter? IT WAS HIS JOB as National Security Advisor to do so. </li>

            Yeah, because he cooperating with government and will testify against others.  THAT is the only reason his other crimes were charged.

           <p>
            Um Trump only fired Flynn AFTER HE HIRED FLYNN for one of the most sensitive jobs in the US government.  AND Trump did this after being warned by the Obama administration that Flynn was a national security risk.  Hired him after Congress told him that Flynn was being paid to promote the Interests of Turkey.
           </p>
           <p>
            He kept Flynn in his very sensitive job AFTER the DOJ told him that Flynn lied to the FBI.  He only fired Flynn when the Washington Post reported on him.  Before he fired Flynn he tried to get Comey to drop his investigation which exposed the President himself to legal jeopardy.
           </p>
           <p>
            An Ex-DOJ guy tweeted this

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             This timeline is so damning for Trump: 
January 24 - Flynn lies to the FBI.
January 26 - Yates warns the WH.
January 27 - Trump responds not by firing Flynn, but asking Comey for a loyalty pledge.
January 30 - Yates fired.
            </p>
            <p>
             Speaking with foreign nationals, including Russian Ambassadors. Why does that matter? IT WAS HIS JOB as National Security Advisor to do so.

           <p>
            Um negotiating foreign policy with foreign powers is illegal for private citizens.  If he did this with Trump's knowledge, you have conspiracy.

            Long Story short, Flynn is cooperating, there's only a few people higher than Flynn he could cooperate against.  A member of Trump's family will be indicted before Christmas.

            I will tell you guys not to worry...this is political theater.  Trump is in total control of the situation and they are just going through this to calm the Libtards down and to make them think they will survive......it makes controlling them easier.  Fact is Trump has gotten control behind the scenes about two weeks ago.  But if we make the whole democrat and republican party luciferians leave at one time....the people will react as if Trump was a dictator and they will be scared....but the matter is Trump is a dictator now.  All the votes and all the media is now just for show.    But watch....the truth will keep coming out drip by drip by drip.  So relax....keep the memes up...keep telling your friends about the Pedophilia and Luciferian stuff.....and enjoy the show.....
           </p>
           <p>
            The Jew/Masons are defeated....they just dont want to have to shoot a lot of dumbass civilians who might think Trump was Evil or something...so that is why they have done this slow reveal techique.

            How is this directly relevant to the Pizzagate investigation (see rule 1) " Relevance: Posts must be directly relevant to investigation of Pizzagate: the sexual/physical abuse and/or murder of children by elites, child trafficking organized by elites, and/or cover-up of these activities and/or the protection/assistance provided to the people who engage in said activities."
What in the title establishes direct relevance to Pizzagate - rule 3 Clarity: All titles must adequately describe post content and must establish direct relevance to pizzagate."
            <br/>
            Having had submissions deleted because I violated these rules I just want to be sure that the application of the rules is consistent.

              Perhaps some Flynn posts followed the rules.  It is possible to post about Flynn and follow the rules.  This post did not.  So if the moderators want to give some posts a pass and not others they need to write more rules, such as anything about Flynn automatically doesn't have to follow the rules.

               Your complaint is no different than what all of us have been saying. The rules are not applied uniformly at all. Flynn posts do have precedence and this argument was a major issue last year but posts about Human trafficking, Organ trafficking and Rothschilds are always deleted even if links to all claims are added. Try posting one and you'll see. The mods have their own agenda and good luck to you but constantly harping about it is a waste of your time. This is meant kindly. Pointing it out will just get you banned.

                One can post about Flynn and meet with the rules.  There is a Pizzagate connection so one can establish that in the Title and the submission.  If the moderators want to have a special rule for certain topics they can add a list of exceptions.  Not being consistent certainly raises questions about their motives.

              I presume the rules were made as they were made because new people just finding the thread would not know how flynn relates to pizzagate without more information.  One thing I know how to do is read
             </p>
             <p>
              3: Clarity:
              <strong>
               All
              </strong>
              titles must adequately describe post content and
              <strong>
               must establish direct relevance to pizzagate
              </strong>
              Has the word "all" suddenly changed its meaning when I wasn't looking?  What about the word "must", has it too changed its meaning?  Or is it the case that the rules are being used selectively to ban the submissions of some people and not others?
             </p>
             <p>
              I suspect that Hillary did not lose to Trump because of Pizzagate (outside of a small circle most people never heard about it as far as I can tell).  But your statement still does not connect Flynn to pizzagate.

            I think there is more to add.  Flynn has always wanted to speak on the Hill telling everything he knows about the Cabal and his pedo list of elites. He did want immunity though if you remember.  I agree with you as well, he took one for the team, but now he will be able to spill his guts on the record.  Don’t forget his tweet about HRC being a pedo, etc.  Warner said today he is anxious what Flynn has to say, yes, him and everyone else on the Hill are anxious=shitting their pants.  Hoohah!!!

             It's a mistake to think we know everything that Mueller knows.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mueller is controlling the release of information. He has not yet revealed all his cards yet because he has other targets in this investigation.  By not putting all the information in the charging documents, this means that other targets/witnesses have to guess what Mueller knows.
            </p>
            <p>
             Papadopolous's agreement did not leak.  Flynn's did not leak.  Politico reported today that is freaking the White House because they have no heads up and even the defense lawyers don't yet know what Mueller has.   So the strategy is ramp up the pressure on other people and make them more willing to cut a deal with Mueller.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even with Manafort, he was charged with older crimes.  Mueller can still issue a superseding indictment and add crimes to the list.
