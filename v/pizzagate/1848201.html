            I say they seem legit--there's some fringe-science stuff on their page and in their podcasts, as well as some conspiracy stuff. At the very least, they seem open-minded enough to poke fun at themselves WHILE actually disseminating actual information. I can totally see someone finding this video, having a laugh, and then getting an itch in the middle of the night. Can't sleep. WAS there a girl whose hands were taped to a table? taptaptap. OMG
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: having gone to their website, they've been on the Alex Jones Show. So apparently they're conspiracy theorists who happen to also be a comedy troupe.

            I like it. If they're making fun of someone, I think it's the people who don't believe.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit:  I'm not sure however, that they are making fun of anyone. Those are actual conversations I've had with people who have been trained by society to disbelieve. They're just doing it in a funny manner to pull in people who aren't pizzagate researchers, thereby getting the thought ball rolling. Whatever it takes to get people talking and considering, I'm all for it.

            I'm a little split too, they seem to understand some of the more in depth mechanization's of the Clinton machine - CGI, dyncorp, and point out that Hillary would not have made a good president either. However, their rampant drug use implies some sort of defect in the character of these men and the title reflects a strange association and disdain for trump and pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm wondering if these contradicting ambiguities are simply just a lack of talent, production quality and forethought of being able to  properly convey the idea behind this skit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Either way, as the saying goes, "Any press is good press".

             i think what they're saying is, there's clearly something to pizzagate, but the zealotry of investigators of low-evidence standards can be amusing.
Or that the denial of pizzagate is amusing, too.
I dunno.  It was fun, tho

             I think you're right, "a lack of forethought". And maybe a few too many bong hits skewed their sense of comedy. But I think their hearts were in the right place and  they certainly have done research. It may actually prove to open some minds to the possibility that these things are real.

            I wasn't sure about this either. It seems like they're making fun of it all, even the evidence, but knowing what the evidence points to, i'm not sure how it's at all funny. Usually i like these guys, but if pizzagate is even slightly possibly true, then it's no laughing matter. They seem to take the stance that it isn't true, and anyone who thinks otherwise is one of those easily dismissed "alt right" weirdos.

             i'm not sure either if its about comedy or about spreading awareness in a subtle fashion and in a way not to make people feel uncomfortable  (since pizzagate is very serious). i've felt like i've had similar convos with people and they make the same exact arguments against pizzagate, but i was really surprised about the sensitive subjects that they did discuss that the mainstream media have obviously been ignoring! ignoring that this is a comedy sketch, they do ask important statements like...."she's taped to the table",  a subject ignored on fox with megan kelly. not sure what to think, either way, in support of pizzagate research or not, i thought this was an important video to share on

             </a>
             just in case it went viral for some reason. if anyone knows if this video is in support of pizzagate research (with sources), that would be great to know, so we could show support!
