<p>Lets start with <strong>Nicole Junkermann</strong> associate and _____ of Jeffrey Epstein, and heavily invested in <strong>CARBYNE</strong>, <strong>RAPIDSOS</strong>, which has connections to g00gle, Fbook, and government, private sector data miners:  . </p>
<p><strong>CARBYNE</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carbyne, a startup out of Israel that has developed a new emergency callout platform that helps providers pinpoint a callers’ exact location and enable other services to improve and speed up communication and response times — by some 65 percent on average — has raised $15 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>The round is significant not just because of the boost that it will give to Carbyne itself, but because of who is doing the backing. Led by Elsted Capital Partners, it also includes Founders Fund, the VC that has backed the likes of Facebook and Airbnb, but also startups that have made strong inroads into working with government and other public sector organizations on data-based services, such as Palantir, Anduril and Deep Mind (now a part of Google).</p>
<p>Previous backers of Carbyne have included the former prime minister of Israel, <strong>Ehud Barak, who is also the company’s chairman</strong>, and the company has now raised about $24 million, with a valuation that I understand to be in the region of $100 million, although the company is not commenting on the number.</p>
<p>Carbyne is not the only startup that is looking to fill the gap between legacy 911 offerings and the promises of what the next generation of cloud-based communication and mobile technology can bring to improve efficiency in these services. RapidSOS provides a bridge between mobile phone calls to 911 and legacy 911 PSAP services, so that those making calls on mobile can still provide location data. RapidSOS also serves as a supplement that works just on mobile in the event that the legacy system falls over, and it <strong>really came into its own during the trio of tropical disasters last autumn across Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida.</strong> Like Carbyne, <strong>RapidSOS</strong> has some big-name supporters: it is backed by former FCC chairmen Tom Wheeler and Julius Genachowski, in addition to a range of other investors. It’s also now integrated with services like Uber and Apple’s iOS for faster reporting of location. One of the points of differentiation between RapidSOS and Carbyne is that the latter is potentially a full replacement for the 911 system in the event that an organization was considering that route. Elichai said that there are several organizations evaluating Carbyne now in across Europe, and it is already rolling out its service in Fayette County in Georgia. But by and large there aren’t many startups looking to disrupt this area, which was one reason why <strong>Founders Fund</strong> was interesting in backing the company. “I’m looking for businesses that aren’t massively competitive, and Carbyne stands alone in a really unpopular industry,” Trae Stephens, a partner at the firm who is leading the investment, told TechCrunch. “In the world of emergency services, it’s really important for tech to contribute to fixing some of the antiquated systems, and that is what excited me. I definitely looked at other companies in emergency services, but but nothing came remotely close to the approach that Carbyne has taken, which is platform-agnostic.”</p>

             Thank you for the deeper dig on the Q Group and Q Cyber. I simply was pointing out another letter "q" found in some of the corporate backing research as it seems to reoccur in intel circles, black hat or white.

            More on how Pegasus works:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The WhatsApp breach was a notable example of a “zero click zero day,” in that it was able to infect a targeted device simply by sending a link to it that didn’t even need to be clicked to deliver its malware payload. NSO Group did not deny that it was behind the attack and the Department of Justice is investigating, according to the Times.
            </p>
            <p>
             NSO Group has consistently denied that it sells its products to governments for the purpose of anything but legitimate law enforcement and intelligence operations. However, researchers at the Toronto-based Citizen Lab have identified its tools in use in dozens of countries, including to target Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident living in Canada as part of an asylum program. Abdulaziz was in contact with fellow dissent Jamal Khashoggi before the latter was lured to the Saudi consulate in Turkey, tortured, and murdered last year.
            </p>
            <p>
             Citizen Lab and Mexican NGOs have also reported that the Mexican government has used Pegasus to illegally spy on journalists, lawyers, and activists, and NSO Group has reportedly sold its tools to a number of autocratic regimes. Its founder and CEO, Shalev Hulio, has justified targeting lawyers and journalists. The company is facing multiple lawsuits in Israel and Cyprus over alleged abuse of its spy tools.

             . It seems its the best way to regain control of anons, the age of transparency, and weaponize our data/services. Especially with the FBI's new interest in conspiracy therrorists, and companies like g00gle trying so hard to control the narrative.

             I agree, but this technology and scope implies something larger than someONE, rather it is an all encompassing move to regain control of mass thought, surveillance, and emergency services. This tech is replacing 'antiquated' first responder location services, data, and security camera footage, that our justice system relies on. If this data is biased, we end up like the Google Whistleblower, flagged as suicidal threat and a danger, weaponizing the police and their protocols against an individual (without needing any of them to be crooked).  Or if suddenly the security camera feed from Epstein's cell 'malfunctions', it can be blamed on technical difficulties, as there was no need for someone to sneak in and erase the tape, they can do it remotely. This is the information that we rely on so heavily, and its now easier for the hidden hand to manipulate it towards their agenda.
