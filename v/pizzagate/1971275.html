<p>Let’s start with Jeffrey Epstein. He\'s the top dog pedophile with a lot of VIP friends. He got a slap on the wrist courtesy of our ZOG controlled police, the best goyim money can buy. Here is what happened to Jeffrey recently:</p>

<p>Now for Pizzagate. Pizzagate is a giant clusterfuck of disinformation and half truths/psyops that I can\'t even begin to go into all of it. I\'m trying to summarize everything to disseminate this info far and wide so you\'re just gonna have to believe what I say about it being 50 percent real and 50 percent PSYOP.  You need to already have some background knowledge on Pizzagate or this shit won\'t make sense.</p>
<p>I\'ve been sleuthing for a long time on this subject and the startling conclusion I came to was that all these anti-human trafficking organizations are actually run by the human traffickers. Here is how I came to this conclusion</p>

<p>Wow, sounds like she\'s kind of a big deal. Hmm… how about that last name…SARNOFF

<p>Wow, what a strong independent and COURAGEOUS woman. We need more good people like this, I\'m sure this woman is on our side. Let’s find out who she is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conchita Sarnoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 500 companies and has produced three current events debate television programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut to Kabul, and a segment for The Oppenheimer Report. She is writing a book about child trafficking in America.

<p>m Manor, N.Y.
Mr. Sarnoff is a grandson of the late David Sarnoff, the chairman of the RCA Corporation. Over a period of more than 50 years, David Sarnoff, who died Dec. 12, 1971, was a pioneer in the development and marketing of radio, phonographs and television.
The bridegroom, who graduated from the Harvard School in North Hollywood, Calif., and the University of California at Los Angeles,is a cable research specialist at NBC. His father, former executive vice president of NBC, is president of Sarnoff Entertainment in Los Angeles. His mother, Janyce Sarnoff, is vice chairman of the 1984 Summer Olympic Games and president of the California Special Olympics.
The bride, who graduated from Columbia University, will be attending the Yale Law School in September. Her father owns an architecture and civil engineering company in Miami and Madrid.”</p>

the wife of some Jewish mainstream media mogul is now at the forefront of exposing a giant elite pedophile ring
We should trust her, she sounds like she herself might be into some eyes wide shut fuckery strictly based on her social standing, but I’m just paranoid</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I’m not certain if she’s still married to this dude but when I looked up his Grandfather David Sarnoff and this is what I found
<a href="http://archive.is/ZQDR2">http://archive.is/ZQDR2</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>David Sarnoff was born to a Jewish family in Uzlyany, a small town in Russian Empire, the son of Abraham and Leah Sarnoff. Abraham emigrated to the United States and raised funds to bring the family. Sarnoff spent much of his early childhood in a cheder (or yeshiva) studying and memorizing the Torah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, so now we know that Conchita Sarnoff is indeed connected to some topdog Jew Media moguls. This is the equivalent to being part of royalty, these people are literally propagandists. At this point I’m almost 100 percent convinced that this is some kind of “Limited Hangout” </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_hangout">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_hangout</a>
A limited hangout or partial hangout is, according to former special assistant to the Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Victor Marchetti, &quot;spy jargon for a favorite and frequently used gimmick of the clandestine professionals. When their veil of secrecy is shredded and they can no longer rely on a phony cover story to misinform the public, they resort to admitting—sometimes even volunteering—some of the truth while still managing to withhold the key and damaging facts in the case. The public, however, is usually so intrigued by the new information that it never thinks to pursue the matter further.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, this shit is circumstantial at best, but it’s not over. Here is where we get into the nitty gritty, this is where shit gets fucked up, and the pendulum swings back to Pizzagate in Washington DC, the Occult Masonic base of operations for world Jewry. </p>
<p>Conchita Sarnoff runs this organization, let’s look at who her organization is connected to, let’s go to the source... Let’s look at the Board of directors</p>

<p>Who is Debra???</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”In 2003, while on holiday in Europe, Deborah Sigmund first heard the phrase “human trafficking.” She had no idea what this was. When the issue was explained to her, she was horrified that buying and selling children is actually a huge business. In fact, it is the fastest growing criminal industry in the world today, producing over $150 billion annually. Every day, young women and children are being bought and sold, used and tortured. As a mother, she felt something had to be done.”</p>

Woah, another strong empowered woman who just wants to save the children. Here is an article about Debra Sigmund and her anti-human trafficking crusade. Did you know that she SINGLE HANDEDLY stopped a child from being trafficked! Now that’s some inspiring shit. Wanna know a fun fact about Debra? She runs Innocents at risk, the same foundation that Izette Folger (connected to Alefantis) is on the board of directors for.

            A limited hangout or partial hangout is, according to former special assistant to the Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Victor Marchetti, "spy jargon for a favorite and frequently used gimmick of the clandestine professionals. When their veil of secrecy is shredded and they can no longer rely on a phony cover story to misinform the public, they resort to admitting—sometimes even volunteering—some of the truth while still managing to withhold the key and damaging facts in the case. The public, however, is usually so intrigued by the new information that it never thinks to pursue the matter further."

           Now, this shit is circumstantial at best, but it’s not over. Here is where we get into the nitty gritty, this is where shit gets fucked up, and the pendulum swings back to Pizzagate in Washington DC, the Occult Masonic base of operations for world Jewry.

           <p>
            ”In 2003, while on holiday in Europe, Deborah Sigmund first heard the phrase “human trafficking.” She had no idea what this was. When the issue was explained to her, she was horrified that buying and selling children is actually a huge business. In fact, it is the fastest growing criminal industry in the world today, producing over $150 billion annually. Every day, young women and children are being bought and sold, used and tortured. As a mother, she felt something had to be done.”

There is also a Lee Merritt Folger on the Bohemian Grove attendees list
Woah, another strong empowered woman who just wants to save the children. Here is an article about Debra Sigmund and her anti-human trafficking crusade. Did you know that she SINGLE HANDEDLY stopped a child from being trafficked! Now that’s some inspiring shit. Wanna know a fun fact about Debra? She runs Innocents at risk, the same foundation that Izette Folger (connected to Alefantis) is on the board of directors for.

              Understand..
 Honeybee is on here and looking at same characters.   Ive done a u-turn of being pro Israel since Pizzagate since last Oct, and recognise the prominence of Jews in this, but its not helpful to be blatently anti jew eg your handle.. Majority Jews dont deserve to  be tarred with same brush.
  Hope u take this as kind suggestion

            First up I believe Epstein is a Mossad agent, Gislaine Maxwell and her father are both Mossad(I think her father faked his own death to get out of debt). I also believe some of "The Jews!(tm)" within the MSM have pretty nefarious objectives.
           </p>
           <p>
            However when you attack an entire religion you immediately discredit all the evidence you just sighted. Far from helping expose the Pedophacracy you're actually helping to keep it in the shadows.
           </p>
           <p>
            You are doing EXACTLY what the W.A.S.P. Mafia want you to do:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Blame "The Jews!(tm)"
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Have every piece of evidence you touch dismissed as an anti-semitic rant.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not a "Joo". I'm a White Anglo Saxon Protestant who for 4 years of prep school and 4 years in the Ivy League lived and studied among the WASP Mafia's farm team. I know how they think. They're all fucking brilliant. They've got 200+ IQs, are the best looking most well read and best athlete you've ever met in your life. It's almost as if they're a different species of human being up at those levels. And I'm not joking. The one's that show the right amount of Psychopathy are hired down on Wall Street and provided they don't fuck up are given lifetime membership in the American Upper Class. And trust me everyone at that level and above down on Wall Street don't consider us Deplorable Shit Lords to be fully human. They call us Muppets. We're chattel to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            The WASP Mafia are orders of magnitude more sophisticated than anything "The Jews!(tm)" could put together. Take 9/11 for example. The 9/11 False Flag attack was the WASP Mafia's Magnum Opus. The entire thing was planned with the precision of the finest Swiss Watch. It was so well planned people are still believing it was Islamic Terrorists TO THIS DAY.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             My favorite example of fine tuning was the World Trade Center
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1966675">
              charade
             </a>
             on 9/11. Larry Silverstein wasn't the largest shareholder in the WTC complex. He had the smallest ownership stake but was listed as the owner on record. The largest stake holders, the Wasp Mafia on both sides of the Atlantic, were hidden and belonged to the usual suspects within the Deep State. Silverstein was added because his Jewish ancestry would immediately label any accusation he had prior knowledge of 9/11 as anti-semitic. Make sense? Can you pick-up the game plan? The WASP Mafia are so many moves ahead they've proven they don't exist. No one's ever heard of the WASP Mafia. Right? Heck most of the people that will read this are going to think I'm crazy.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            So please go easy on the Joo Hatred. Yes Israel played a part in 9/11 and in Brownstone Ops on Pedo Island but they're second fiddle. You need to up your game and go after the tippy top. Until then you're just grinding gears and doing more harm than good.

The Maccabees, also spelled Machabees (Hebrew: מכבים or מקבים, Maqabim; Latin: Machabaei or Maccabaei; Greek: Μαkkαβαῖοι, Makkabaioi), were the leaders of a Jewish rebel army that took control of Judea, which at the time had been a province of the Seleucid Empire. They founded the Hasmonean
dynasty, which ruled from 164 BCE to 63 BCE. They reasserted the Jewish religion, partly by forced conversion, expanded the boundaries of Judea by conquest and reduced the influence of Hellenism and Hellenistic Judaism.

             Eleanor Emmons Maccoby (born May 15, 1917, in Tacoma, Washington) is an American psychologist who is most recognized for her research and scholarly contributions to the field of child and family psychology. Throughout her career she studied developmental psychology, specifically, sex differences, gender development, gender differentiation, parent-child relations, child development, and social development from the child perspective. Maccoby obtained her M.A and Ph.D. from the University of Michigan where she worked under B.F Skinner. She also did her dissertation research in Skinner's Harvard laboratory. Maccoby continued her psychology career at Stanford University, where she served as a professor, member and chair of the department of psychology and conducted various research. Her research resulted in multiple publications with her most recognized publication being her book, The Development of Sex Differences (1966). Maccoby has received numerous awards for her work; however, in 2000 Maccoby was named the first-ever recipient of an award named in her honor, which was The Maccoby Award. The American Psychological Association listed Eleanor Maccoby as number 70 out of 100 for the most eminent psychologists of the 20th century

            Now let’s get into Jorge Puello, the guy who mentioned friends of Ophans.

             The one-time legal adviser, who calls himself Jorge Puello, now acknowledges that he faces sex trafficking charges in El Salvador under the name Jorge Anibal Torres Puello. He remained at large on Monday, as Dominican, Salvadoran and American law enforcement officials worked with Interpol to interview his relatives and search border and immigration records to find him.

             This isn't as surprising as you might think.
I researched this long ago and the government was hands-on bringing the east to the west while tweaking it with unique aspects all its own.
             <br/>
             Look into  the Theosophy Society, who  even went to India to recruit someone they could groom as a guru.  They recruited a few men and  ended up with the man now known as  J. Krishnamurti.   J K eventually discovered the corruption and attempted to separate himself from the decades of brainwashing that he was part of.
            </p>
            <p>
             The theosophy society, especially under  Helena Blavatsky and  Alice Baily, brought  western beliefs along with newly contrived ascended master stories.   This dovetailed into  the Lucis Trust Foundation, which changed it's name to Lucis from Lucifer.   They're an appendage of Masons belief that Lucifer is the Light Bringer who had a bad rap and is the actual savior of humanity  (see similarities between  enlil/enki sumerian-babylonian transcripts).
             <br/>
             It should be noted that the Lucis Trust foundation represents  the U.N. and promotes  a global teaching program called  Triangles. 
My opinion is that this system is  presented as the Government  belief system for  the citizens.  The board members of Lucis Trust names top names.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the 1930's  a government worker named  Guy Ballard was sent to  Mt. Shasta on a work assignment.
He contributed a book about  meeting ascended masters, one being St. Germain.
             <br/>

            </p>
            <p>
             The stories have dove-tailed with stories of  Galactic Federation underworld cities and all types of things that program people's minds to accept  Mt Shasta as a holy place, not to mention  the headquarters of St. Germain society. 
Nowadays, if a hiker goes off course on Mt Shasta they might meet up with  a few men who tell you to  ''git off ma property''.

             many folks imagine   the doors of the Lemurian underground city and don't appear to connect the  St Germain society with the doors, or other types of groups that could be related.

             other people suppose that the rocks are ancient doorways.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's interesting to note that a  really odd looking dude came on the ytube channel scene hashtagging  pizzagate, claiming he works in tech and shows meditational vids of  himself immersed in the Mt Shasta  cult-ure.
            </p>
            <p>
             Back to  St Germain's invention.   Germain was a count in Europe.   It's also interesting that some folks tag the name  vampire to pedophiles who deal   in blood and energy rituals.
            </p>
            <p>
             It isn't hard to imagine that an entire belief system emerged out of something so insane, considering the  cremation of care and other strange shit that goes on in the  rich political club at Bohemian Grove.  I suppose they have groups and activities created for all levels of society.
            </p>
            <p>
             Getting back to the highlight data of  Eleanor Maccoby.... Their  lives may have been unusual for the average citizen at that time period,  but not for specific  families linked to government  creation and implementation of  Theosophy and other types of beliefs that brought this made up  shit to North America and further developed  a  U.N. group that would incorporate varying levels of this belief into its system through phases.
            </p>
            <p>
             It gained more steam because  Eastern guru's were coming to North America, which some of their ancient teachings have been implemented in the government created  belief system that is now used in U.N. under Lucis Trust, aka  theosophy, aka  Guy Ballard's Mt Shasta creation, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             An ancient method of creating new belief systems is to  combine pieces of old systems  together so as to have information that is recognizable and familiar to many of the people to whom the perpetrators want to  throw this new system upon.
             <br/>
             For that reason the U.N.  Triangles, aka  Lucis Trust, aka theosophy etc etc  is welcomed globally.
            </p>
            <p>
             Were these people   pioneers of this government induced system, living this, as  Eleanor's example  indicates?
            </p>
            <p>
             Fast forward to 2017,  how might a compilation of masonry,  political and social pedophilia as either  complicit or participating, hiding under the camouflage of art and theater  cause their progeny to appear today --- accepting their  culture as completely normal and generations old.
