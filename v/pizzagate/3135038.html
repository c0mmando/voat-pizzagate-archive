            Come on Anons. No one can be the least bit surprised at their behavior with Uncle Joe. Their rules don't apply to themselves. Unless it's time to turn the tables and bore down twice as hard on their "standards" as the leftist has done to our President and Justice Kavanaugh for example.
           </p>

            I am not condoning violence, doxxing, smears. There is no need for that as the Dems have provided ample material for their feet to be held to the proverbial fire by their same standards.

            More trouble ahead for Biden:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Biden Has A Major Ukraine Problem
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Joe Biden appears to have made a major tactical error last year when he bragged to an audience of foreign policy experts how he threatened to hurl Ukraine into bankruptcy if their top prosecutor, General Viktor Shokin, wasn't immediately fired.
            </p>
            <p>
             relevant video footage:
            </p>
            <p>
             Biden described how he threatened Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in March 2016 that the Obama administration would pull $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees, sending the former Soviet republic toward insolvency, if it didn’t immediately fire Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Well, son of a bitch, he got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time," Biden said at the Council on Foreign Relations event - while insisting that former president Obama was complicit in the threat.
            </p>
            <p>
             And why would Biden want the "son of a bitch" fired?
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              In what must be an amazing coincidence, the prosecutor was leading a wide-ranging corruption investigation into a natural gas firm - which Biden's son, Hunter, sat on the board of directors.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              U.S. banking records show Hunter Biden’s American-based firm, Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC, received regular transfers into one of its accounts — usually more than $166,000 a month — from Burisma from spring 2014 through fall 2015,
              <strong>
               during a period when Vice President Biden was the main U.S. official dealing with Ukraine and its tense relations with Russia.
              </strong>
              -The Hill
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              And before he was fired, Shokin says he had made "specific plans" for the investigation - including "interrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board, including Hunter Biden.”
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Joe Biden "clearly had to know" about the probe before he insisted on Shokin's ouster.

            Pretty sickening to see these enablers stick up for Biden, they obviously haven't reviewed all of the material and they are going to have to backtrack
            <strong>
             once they see Biden sneaking up on the undeveloped breast of a 4 year old child
            </strong>

             DC knows....with all  the videos of the little girls being sniffed, hugged and whispered to, the children were more uncomfortable than the parents........am suspicious of all who think he is just a sweet old man. One video is all it takes to know..........and the so called clarence thomas investigation when the accusers were not allowed to testify. ......only Anita Hill hung out to dry.

            I guess technically she is right. . It doesn't disqualify him.. unless of course he goes to prison. And Democrats don't give a fuck what other Democrats do... Just just plain don't care if Biden rapes kids gropes kids gropes women or any of that, because as we have seen time and time again, there's a double standard.
           </p>

            You can bet you ass if trump wasn't video pinching 10 year old senators daughters nipples they would be all over that shit.. but Biden is a democrat so look the other way..
