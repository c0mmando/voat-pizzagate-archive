            People keep saying the point about no food prepared outside, and thank you for pointing that out, but do you think ingredients could have been flown in, scanned over by secret service, and then cooked on site like any other entre they make? They can't grow everything, slaughter the pigs, and make pepperoni and cheese and franks from scratch at the white house on that scale. If they have a steak dinner party for 30 people, they don't have cows grazing on the white house lawn waiting to be slaughtered; they have to order the steak and cook it on site right? But what  I really would like to know is, who was at those pizza and hot dog parties you know? A guy from Stratfor mentions he liked the "waitresses" there someone said on here "waitress" is a code for young girl. Who was at those parties???

            "Jan. 11 is National Human Trafficking Awareness Day. "  It is being handed to all outspoken investigators of PG et al on a silver platter. Does anyone see this as free advertising for what we are fighting for? Something we can attach to in order to break out of the bubble the MSM has locked us into? ANYBODY INTO PR WHO THINKS WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS.

            totally agree. what heart? All I'm thinking is, fuque, the PG investigators can take advantage of it. Doesn't matter what you think about the guy. I Don't give a shi# about intent, but we should be able to take advantage of this Proclamation. Screw the intent. We'll never know. BUT, whenever someone gets nailed because they are reporting on Pizzagate, or in general by the MSM, the Proclamation can be stuffed in their face. "The President told me to investigate. I'm only following orders. Are you not patriotic?" or some stupid thing like that. I'm just saying we could use it as a free pass for the month.
           </p>
           <p>
            For my part, it will be seeing what Newpapers and Media have reported this proclamation and then blast PG, Epstein, Franklin, in their comment sections, and with "full backing and support by the president."

            His secretary of state caused mass chaos in libya, syria, turkey, and who knows where else. In those places, human trafficking has occurred on nightmare levels. If he DOESN'T know about  her dealings, then he is incompetent to serve. If he DOES, then he is guitly of war crimes and treason with the rest of them. Either way he is up shits creek.

            It's doubtful this is coming from his heart. My first thought is that there are ulterior motives.  As mentioned here already, it probably will serve as a level of insulation when any future accusations come up. More likely it is a calling card to the inside players to start cleaning up the tracks, taking cover, and laying low...putting them on notice that the new admin. is gonna let go of the dogs on these sycophants.

            " I call upon businesses, national and community organizations, families, and all Americans to recognize the vital role we must play ..."  -- He is not talking about no fuquing OFFICIAL investigation, essentially, he's saying "all Americans," 24/7.  That includes us, and it includes now -- January being the special month. We can use it to stick into the faces of any and all fake news debunkers. Make a ruckus about it, how the President has your back. Of course he doesn't, but you could sure spin it that way. Would really confuse the press, at any rate. Tell the press that Voat and the President share a unified field theory about human trafficking. 
just seems to be something on a silver platter. 
This is an Epidemic so dangerous that the President announces it to begin 3 DAYS after he has invented it? Hell, that can be used by whoever does PR at Voat, i.e. outreach. If the president thinks there's an epidemic, the MSM comes across as slackers because they are ignorant of this menace. There's all sorts of ways to swing it in a campaign. maybe not.

            We can't view anything through the lens of what we might do or say, or what our motives might be.  They are 100% nothing like us. We have to think like they do, usually the exact opposite of where we're coming from.
           </p>
           <p>
            This has to be cover/deflection.  It makes sense. They're running scared.
           </p>
           <p>
            We already know they use humanitarianism as cover and it deflects from Pizzagate, "How could we be involved in anything like that when you can see that we are the people actively fighting against it."

            If there's any "official investigation" under his order....then it will be but another charade....actors used to play it all out on television....so they could say they were the good guys who got the bad guys in the show.   Obama good at getting bad guys, remember, Obama got Osama?  It was in all the news, might have even been a Hollywood movie about it.

             tough to call for an investigation when you're gone in three weeks. It seems to be a shout out to "all americans." Just seems like it is something to run with against the press. don't know if he intended that, but it sure could be handy for those who know PR. Mods?

            Whereas six months ago, Obama tried to paper over Malaysian human trafficking in order that they might join the TPP. An open trade zone. For human traffickers. 
Even Pedosta knew that was going to open some eyes:
