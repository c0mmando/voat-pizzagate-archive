<p>When we last checked it with the Enquirer they were throwing Flynn under the bus when it became apparent that more and more was going to come out on Flynn.</p>
<p>Now they are throwing everybody under the bus to promote the idea that all these guys were connected to Russia, and Trump didn\'t know about it.  Let\'s read that headline several more time.  TRUMP DOESN\'T KNOW.   Are we good?  Every one got it?  TRUMP DIDN\'T KNOW.  It was revealed this week that Flynn committed a specific crime.  The Enquirer got there first.   So I expect more stuff to come out on Stone, Manafort and Page.  And remember, Trump doesn\'t know those guys.  Never met them.</p>
<p>And General Flynn who promoted the True Pundit NYPD child trafficking claims and whose son promoted pizzagate is in real trouble.
Flynn on his security review documents didn\'t reveal that he was paid by Russians and Congressfolk have said this was a clear violation of the law.  The White House is refusing to turn over any documents on who checked Flynn out.

            No, the US is qualitatively different is every way.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dissent is a pervasive and daily activity in the US in every city and state in the country.  The Press is way more free in the US.   Russia has been rated at "Not Free" for over a decade.  And it's only gotten worse.  They used to  "Partly Free" before Putin began consolidating power.   The press is more free in Afghanistan.
           </p>
           <p>
            Show a me a single example in the US that comes close to the Sergei Magnitsky case.  Do you think if a major politician was shot on a DC street like Boris Nemtsov was in Moscow, there would be no investigation into his death?

            is one of very few continuous posters here who adds value by bringing up ways to explain away the evidence as anodyne. We all need to do this as well to arm against "debunking" the strongest and best evidence. I am a believer in pizzagate and get called a shill when I provide context for evidence that is picked up here and there. But I don't care since there aren't enough people scrutinizing evidence here. Scrutiny adds value to the evidence. You guys always yelling and itching to use with your brand new pitchfork rather than explore your confirmation bias, are the ones who are NOT providing additional value to the forum.

It does not make any sense and it makes the American people think they have something to hide. There is a paper trail that the White House does not want our committee to follow it."

            I see why the National Enquirer is pushing this.   All those guys are going to testify before the House Intelligence Committee.  And Jared Kushner is going to as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kushner also did not list recent contacts with foreign nationals on his SF-86 which sounds like the same crime as Flynn committed.

            Sorry but when you're citing CNN as a supposed factual source, I stopped reading!
CNN has never ever reported anything truthful about Trump! 
Why is this committee not going after Podesta and HillPedo for giving Russia 20% of our Uranium?

             It's not. It's just that the U.S.A. cannot exist as the biggest most evil nation without educating their citizens into hating comic book supervilains. Kim Jon Un and Putin are those people. Except everything they hang over Putin is an active tactic and much more widespread tactic when performed by the U.S. The thing I am a bit miffed at with Russia is that they are 20 years behind when it comes to human rights, and that leaves out  LOT of people, like the LGBT community. Though I do understand that Russia takes protectionist measures against the exploitation of Russians because of abuse of their orphans and  sexual exploitation of young people in internet cam companies that cater to and enrich Americans.

              Eva, this is nonsense.  Russia is 131st on the list of least corrupt countries, they illegally stole Crimes, political dissent has been pretty much made illegal, their anti aircraft missile shot down a civilian​ flight and killed 300 people.   A website like this would need to officially register with the government or be shut down.
