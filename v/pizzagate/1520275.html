            I used my own resources to tag, flyer, call and generally raise awareness from LA to Seattle and back. Dosent that count for something? I'm taking the bus and crashing on floors and in hostels. Not exactly a lavish lifestyle. Even occupy had an operating budget. Travel, supplies, public stunts, novel data proliferation techniques all cost money. I will be posting progress pics and video for accountability. I put up a video talking about what I'm doing and why on my Facebook. My real name is out there. You can see  how many people from my community have ridiculed me for speaking out.  I'm at least engaged IRL. like I said I am not going to stop even if no funds comes in. I've done it up till now without

            I'm creating my own Webseries on a completely different subject matter. As a trained actress it's not easy or cheap to create a video and post it online that will attract viewers. Even if I'm interested in the subject matter I won't watch after the 1st few seconds if the speaker isn't articulate and interesting with a very engaging voice. Professionals know to adjust their vocal tone and speed/pace. Music and graphics really add to a video's appeal as well as it's cost. Lighting is crucial.
           </p>
           <p>
            So please don't tell the world to create a video as it will be a total waste for most. There are now over a dozen FB groups under variations of the word Pizzagate and all are very small. While it lets people express their anger and frustration how much do you think it actually accomplishes?

            Much better for those with time and energy to follow the suggestions provided earlier to post on Twitter or Instagrams. If you're a skilled public writer find out what widely read publications will post your emails as you're a veteran. Contact all of the religious groups in the country and see if they'll post what you write. I KNOW your heart is in it. You need to know the best way to contact the largest number of people for the least amount of $$.

            Veteran's Today was one of the first to publicize this story (feb 2015), perhaps you can contact the writer Jaochim Hagopianthem through VT and get support for a vets group to attend the inauguration. As proved by Standing Rock, a group of vets has a stronger voice than anyone else these days.

            hey mate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's say first I suspend any disbelief for now, you know we have issues with shills here.
           </p>
           <p>
            You are doing good work, and you being a veteran is a valuable asset you can utilize to further our causes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Strategically activating 2 groups of civilians is very valuable, because they have traditionally a strong voice in the american public: veterans and moms
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't get me wrong, most politicians won't give a fuck but those are not the people we try to impress, servericemen are for the most held in a very high regard in the USA, considering this country is a giant warmachine; and
            <em>
             everybody
            </em>
            can relate to Moms - mothers fighting for their children are dangerous, and can reach a critical mass surprisingly fast.
           </p>
           <p>
            Therefore we have to focus to get this rolling, and you are in a premium position to do this. Moms are not on voat, but Moms will listen to a vet, and Moms talk with Moms. You have to get the ball rolling. Ideas spread like diseases, think of how you can infect as many towns and communities as you can.
           </p>
           <p>
            That brings me to my next point: Your current gofundme will most likely not blow up. You already showed way more dedication than most people and reprioritized your life onto this, so it is important to appropriately show your cause here to get the resources you need to roll. Because if you are who you say and are 100% determined to be one of the heroes stepping up physically, you are one of our most valuable assets.
           </p>
           <p>
            You obviously have internet access, that means you have a laptop or phone, that means you can make a video.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tell your story in video and I bet you have way way better chances of getting the trust of this board and donations
           </p>
           <p>
            sincerly, Cass

             I put up a public video on my Facebook feed talking about how I got involved and what I'm doing. I'd appreciate any feedback you can give. You can also see the posts where I sell off my remaining gear and my peers wish me goodbye from the industry. I hope that lends some credibility. My goal here is to be a physical instrument of the user group here. You guys often have better ideas than I could come up with.

              I was talking about a directly watchable video linked in the description of the gofundme campaign and your startpost here, rule 1 in business: dont make it hard for people to give you money; currently you have too many obstacles for people to get to the conclusion you being legit.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you do that it would help tremendously, we'd be able to spread the word around way easier.

               I just put the same video I posted to Facebook  into an update on the gofundme. Thanks for the tips I'm new at this and really appreciate the guidance. Maybe if I posted recipts and showed people how the money was being spent too? I want to start a shwag campaign. Use concert promoter tactics. Pizzagate lighters and bottle openers. Something that you would want to keep. Scatter them at sporting events. Something cheap to produce but with greater physical persistence then a tag. I have been using glow in the dark paint. That way it's hard to see what I'm doing initially but the night reveals the message.

                Yes, you are going into the right direction with your thoughts. What people want is what they dont get from the Mainstream Media, honesty, information, transparency. Not being lied to anymore and being sold and betrayed.

            I have an idea!
           </p>
           <p>
            get a video camera &amp; microphone - grab a friend to be cameraman - go out into public and tell random groups of people you are doing on-the-street interviews for a website and ask if they would be interesting in talking for a few minutes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ask people about PG, meanwhile dropping some red pills and info-bombs for a few mintues - thank them, pass them a flyer &amp; move on to the next.
           </p>
           <p>
            much easier to engage with random strangers this way - people love being on camera and asked questions - also would make for a great compilation video

            Don't give up! Most people don't want to accept the fact too many kids go missing and a lot of them is never heard from again.
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem that RealityCalls uncovered with the missing kids statistics not being updated timely is also something serious. You would assume that the government would give enough money to make a missing kids system work as smooth as can be.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lets hope Trump will fund them like mad so they can actually do their job and put all these kids on the websites and more importantly, in the statistics. We need to know exactly how many kids go missing and how many of them are found and how many are not. I wonder if the registration of missing kids is flawed in other countries too.

            I can understand your need to take action, and you should know that even if you don't see results directly, you may be helping someone without realizing it. What you are doing is important. People who abuse children are both sick and heinous, and need to be called out. No child should have to suffer for an adult's perversion and their abuse is unforgivable. However, do not abuse yourself further, do not sacrifice what you need, your warm home, healthy meals, and your support.  Make sure that taking care of yourself is number one priority. We are in this together and we need you, your dedication and your story.

             I was a glass maker for 9 years. Honestly it's hard not to talk about it in the present tense still. Everybody told me I was nuts / a fool to leave to do this thing.  Idk man... I'm still trying to wrap my head around this. I know I have to do ...something. trying to make a dent. My "pizzagate is not fake news" slogan showed up on reddit and twitter and here so I think it's working?

                Selling a business should have provided adequate funds to do so little. Of course; maybe it was a shitty business. If that is the case, why give money to someone who can't get his shit together over 9 years, but suddenly 1 month of lurking, you are an expert with a sound plan to spend every dollar wisely.

                 I had to give the money from my business to my family. I left behind a girlfriend and a dog and a house with bills. I couldn't just leave her high and dry, I gave them what little I had so they could be stable. So what if my business was small? At least i perseued my art to the point where i had a business. I've been out doing this thing on foot and bus for almost a month on my own power. I feel like that merits more than your blatant contempt.

               Ouch... I figured there's going to be debate if this is legit or not. Kinda sucks that I'm trying to go hard and people think I'm nuts or a liar. Cost of doing business i guess

                keep in mind people here are a bit hard to convince because we've shoveled so much bullshit. No one here deny that what you're saying you're doing is great. But it's a tough crowd when you don't have much proof to show.

                 I just put up a video on my Facebook feed talking about what I'm doing and why. I also posted about dismantling my business and many in my community said their goodbyes. My "pizzagate is  not fake news" tags have caused debate on voat, reddit and twitter. You can see me losing friends and getting called  crazy for publicly posting about this.  I am committed to this

              I think people are just concerned because it doesn't seem very legit. You don't even have a real profile photo up. If you changed that, I think more people would be inclined to donate. Or a video of you talking about pizza gate. I'd donate, but I need to make sure you're not just a scammer.
