<p>This is related to Pizzagate because it concerns the dark underbelly of the international adoption industry which as one critic describes it, has been &quot;a Wild West, all but free of meaningful law, regulation, or oversight&quot; where babies and children from poor countries are bought and sold by unscrupulous entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>&quot;Russian adoptions&quot; were in the U.S. headlines for the last few months because of the sensational news of the meeting in Trump Tower last summer between Donald Trump, Jr., and Natalya Veselnitskaya, a Russian attorney who claimed to be lobbying influential Americans for the restart of Russian adoptions in the U.S. which were banned in 2012 by Putin in what many observers believed was retaliation for the Magnitsky Act.</p>
<p>Incidentally, &quot;Russian adoptions&quot; came up on Aug. 1, 2017, in Ed Butowsky\'s contentious exchange with Chris Cuomo about Rod Wheeler\'s lawsuit against Fox News. Butowsky is a Republican donor who hired Rod Wheeler as a private investigator for the Rich family.</p>
<p>Ed Butowsky said he spoke to Sean Spicer at the White House, and made this startling statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Sean and I talked about many things. You won\'t believe it, but coincidentally, we talked about Russian adoptions, just like Don Jr.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>IS &quot;RUSSIAN ADOPTIONS&quot; CODE FOR INTERNATIONAL PEDOPHILE NETWORK?</strong></p>
<p>In case there are those who believe the Russian Federation\'s ban of Russian adoptions was merely a case of &quot;Wicked Putin sacrificing poor handicapped Russian children as political pawns in retaliation against US sanctions against Russia&quot;, please consider this:</p>
<p>The Russian Federation has been increasingly alarmed by cases of Russian adoptees being abused/killed/trafficked by Americans since 2008 when Putin barred 3 adoption agencies from conducting business in Russia---among them the notorious European Adoption Consultants, headquartered in Strongsville, OH.</p>
<p>In 2011 FM Sergei Lavrov instituted stricter supervision and regulations over Russian adoptions in US during the &quot;Russian Reset&quot; so when Putin signed the Dima Yakovlev Law on December 28, 2012---the Feast of the Holy Innocents, a date fraught with meaning---this was the next step in an ongoing effort to curb an already-existing crisis. The next year, the Russian govt. launched a criminal probe into illegal adoptions (rehoming) and the online trafficking of Russian children by Americans.</p>
<p><strong>NEW TIMELINE OF THE &quot;RUSSIAN ADOPTIONS&quot; NARRATIVE</strong></p>
<p>In light of the recent tragic events of the Las Vegas massacre, one related event now needs to be connected to the &quot;Russian Adoptions&quot; narrative: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/members-and-associates-russian-crime-syndicate-arrested-racketeering-extortion-robbery">On June 7, 2017</a>, the head of a powerful Russian crime syndicate, Razhden Shulaya, was arrested in Las Vegas and placed under high security in NYC.</p>
<p>Did this arrest have anything to do with the subsequent revelation a few weeks later of the Donald Trump Jr meeting at the Trump Tower with the Russian lawyer by the NY Times?</p>
<p>If you recall, Don Trump Jr <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/09/us/donald-trump-jrs-two-different-explanations-for-russian-meeting.html">gave a statement</a> on July 8, 2017, and described the meeting thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government,</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-jr-statement-adoptions-putin-meeting-2017-8"><em>Business Insider</em></a> claims Donald Trump Jr\'s statement was crafted by his father one day after the President met with Vladimir Putin at the G10 summit on July 7 in Hamburg:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And it was crafted by the president one day after he discussed &quot;adoptions&quot; with Russian President Vladimir Putin during a dinner at the G20 summit.</p>
<p>Asked about the G20 summit meeting with Putin, Trump said they talked about &quot;Russian adoptions&quot;</p>
<p>Asked about that dinner later, Trump told the New York Times that he and Putin &quot;just talked about things. Actually, it was very interesting; we talked about adoptions.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Kremlin confirmed that &quot;Russian adoptions&quot; were the topic of discussion between Trump and Putin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump discussed the issue of adoptions at the G20 summit dinner two weeks ago, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I can confirm indeed this topic was touched upon. I cannot say more than that,&quot; Peskov said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Peskov emphasized that lifting the ban on Russian adoptions was NOT what was discussed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When asked whether the law banning adoptions of Russian children by US citizens could be reconsidered, the Kremlin spokesman said &quot;this is not under discussion.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>Were Trump and Putin really discussing the Russian Mafia\'s crime syndicate\'s human trafficking network? Was Donald Trump Jr\'s highly publicized statement a warning to the rest of the international child trafficking network that they were on Trump\'s radar?</p>
<p>&quot;Russian adoptions&quot; quickly became a catchphrase on social media, and the internet was a-buzz with that term. Will we ever know what that phrase really means?</p>',

            My friend, you still don't understand what you are examining here.  Russian Adoptions is now and always has meant, dropping sanctions against  Russia.  Putin hates these sanctions and getting them lifted is practically his number one foreign policy concern.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why does he hate them?  Because Sanctions are working.

              They have hit the Russian economy hard at the same time oil prices are way down creating a double whammy.  As a result in 2016 Russia had a recession about a third as deep as the recession following the financial crisis of 2008-2009

              They have hit his people hard by hitting the oligarchs/gangsters he works with in the pocketbook.  It's a lot harder for them to put their money into banks anywhere in the world because that bank would then face the risk of being cut off from the US Banking system which would be a crippling blow.  So they have spent more time and more money laundering their money so they can store it someplace clean.  By making it problematic for Putin's people, it undermines Putin's power, makes him less sure of his position because his guarantees of impunity may no longer apply if their money can get confiscated.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Putin did not retaliate against the US Magnitsky Act with a Russian version of it because the types of crimes the Magnitsky Act targets by and large are not happening here.  But he need to do something against the US and something that hurt Americans and had emotional impact, so he did an adoption ban.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other thing you need to understand is that leaders like Putin need enemies, enemies to rail against.  And that is how Putin used the adoption issue.   It played right into his hands, it made American look bad and it stoked Russian nationalism, two prime goals of Putin.  That is why this was a big issue before the Magnitsky Act.  You should check out the book “Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible."  It was written by a guy born in Russia who moved to the UK and later moved back to Russia to work in Russia Television.  He was there just as the new style of Russia propaganda was taking off.  Putin basically cracked down and independent media and now has control over all Russian TV news for the most part.  If you live in Moscow, you may get other sources of news, but most of Russian relies on Russian TV and that is why Putin is popular.    The author said News editors would begin their weekly meetings with who is the enemy of the week.  Finding new enemies to rail against was routine.  This is the background to view the issue of adoptions and you need consider this before you judge Putin to be sincere about adoptions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regarding Trump what actions of his make you think he working against some worldwide pedophilia ring.
           </p>
           <p>
            by the way, remember when we said this law had a lot of opponents in Russia and it was called Herod's Law?  I just saw this page, where there's a photo of a Russian protester with King Herod on a poster.  20,000 marched against this law.  They called it the Shame and March Against the Scum, the scum being the politicans who voted for the law because they were using orphans as pawns and the orphans would end up suffering.  That they were using a tiny number of cases of abuse to potray the entire adoption program.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             About 20,000 Russians upset with their country’s new law banning Americans from adopting Russian children marched in protest Sunday on central Moscow and St. Petersburg. The ban is widely viewed as retaliation for a U.S. law targeting Russians accused of human rights abuses, and for the perceived mistreatment of some Russian adoptees in the United States. Opponents of the ban claim that Russian president Vladimir Putin is using children to make a political point and solidify his conservative base in the wake of the controversial 2011 parliamentary elections.

             Very nice try, Are We Sure, but the Russian adoption ban was put in place by the Russian government in response to many cases of death, abuse and trafficking of Russian adoptees by Americans. One prime example was the 2009 case of Andrew Mogilyansky, a wealthy car dealer in Pennsylvania who financed a child sex ring involving Russian orphans:

              Yeah that was a reaction months later.   From your link, note the enthusiasm.
Police said 12,000 people joined the rally, and organisers denied allegations some were coerced or paid to attend.

              If Putin actually cared about this issue, why is so willing to do away with this law?   Russia has offered time and time and time again to abolish this law. 
If the law is needed why not keep it?
             </p>
             <p>
              Why is this law always the ONLY ONE he offers to abolish when asking us to withdraw the Magnitsky Act?   Why does he use the same lawyer, Natalie V. on both the adoption issue and the Magnitsky Act?  Why is she the lawyer for both the money laundering case built on the tax fraud that Magnitsky uncovered and the point person the Russian Aoption Law?
             </p>
             <p>
              Why are adoptions tied to sanctions in anyway?  If this was actually a legitimate issue, why not pass this law on its own?  Or try to work with the US to include better safeguards?   More importantly, why not try to fix the problems in the Russian system for orphans.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why did Putin tie the adoption issue to the Magnitsky Act and why is he so willing to revoke the adoption ban?

               Putin's under severe international pressure to revoke ban, but he says he won't revoke it unless very tough regulations on the American side are put in place which are not forthcoming.

              <p>
               He passed comprehensive laws to reform Russian orphanages when Dima Yakovlev Law was passed. Perhaps he tied the adoption issue to the Magnitsky Act because he knew there was great demand for Russian orphans in the trafficking network, and he hoped to expose them by making them come forward and try to work out a deal repealing the ban. That, I believe, was Natalya's mission: to set up a NGO purporting to repeal the Russian adoption ban so pedophiles and traffickers would come forward to negotiate. It failed early on, because her cover was blown.

              I would add that Putin vigorously defended the Dima Yakovlev Law at a press conference in 2012:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Mr. Putin said the United States was failing to live up to an agreement ratified earlier this year, by not allowing Russian officials to get involved in abuse cases involving adopted Russian children, even as observers. And he lashed out at one reporter who challenged him.
              </p>
              <p>
               “This is unacceptable,” he said. “Do you find it normal? Do you like it? Are you a sadomasochist?”
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/21/world/europe/putin-says-his-decision-on-us-adoption-ban-will-come-later.html">

              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Most recently, when pressed on the adoption ban, Russian authorities have said they are willing to revisit the issue, but the American govt will not cooperate with the necessary supervision and monitoring regulations required by the Russian federation if adoptions in America were resumed.

               By the way, AreWeSure, going back to our freewheeling discussions about Brooklyn in the past, the DOJ statement about the arrest of the Russia mobster listed many of his accomplices as living in Brooklyn:

            Correct the Russian Adoptions is in fact a code word for child trafficking. Putin put an end to it so he is hated by the elites.

            I posted this article I found awhile back. Very cryptic about Putin and Pizza
           </p>
           <p>
            And a commenter pointed out that he stopped adoptions
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             He also has ended the adoptions from Russia (no kids, no pizza) Hmmm

            Trump and Putin talking "adoption" could be a very good sign Imo

            Gilderoy, you have done a marvelous job keeping us informed about EAC and the Russian adoption situation.  I hope you are right that maybe this is in connection with the Russian Mafia and the US Mafia faction possibly being connected.  At least that would make sense.  A global worldwide operation could be in operation.  This makes me wonder if Trump and Putin are working on it's eradication.

             Is this why the Dems are pushing the Russia stole the election, so hard???  I thought it was to cover up the illegal wire tapping, but it could be because they know Trump is working with Putin on the pedogate stuff and are muddying the waters so if anything does come to light, they can claim "muh Russia" and say it is a cover up to election fraud, etc.  They already have half the country hating Trump &amp; Russia and thinking they are in on some illegal shit together.

              I have not real proof of course that this is happening, but my hope is that it is true.  I want to see all the bad actors, both Democrats and Republicans suffer the consequences.  Aside from Hillary and Bill and Chuck Schumer, there are Paul Ryan, John McCain, Rance Priebus, Lindsey Graham etc.  I want to see them all fall, one by one.  They try to make us believe they are adversaries, when they are all united for one common purpose.  Our enslavement.  The New World Order.
