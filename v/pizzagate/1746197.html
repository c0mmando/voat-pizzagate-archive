<p>Here is a quote from a recent article:
&quot;Only 10 people have ever been brought to trial for their part in albino attacks or murders - but not one of them was a \'buyer\'.
The only people who have been convicted are the witch doctors and the hired killers,\' said Peter.

<p>I realize that, like the horror of Pizzagate crimes, this is not new, but it is interesting as part of the larger picture.

<p>It is not organ trafficking, but hands, arms legs, skin, faces, genitals, etc. are removed form living people allegedly for &quot;witchcraft&quot; and the shaman is the middleman--the buyer always unknown. Sometimes graves are dug for whole bodies.</p>
