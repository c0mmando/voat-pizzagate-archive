<p>Here is a quote from a recent article:
&quot;Only 10 people have ever been brought to trial for their part in albino attacks or murders - but not one of them was a \'buyer\'.
The only people who have been convicted are the witch doctors and the hired killers,\' said Peter. 
But they would never name the customer - even when the witch doctor is given the death sentence. Never has a customer been named.\'</p>

<p>I realize that, like the horror of Pizzagate crimes, this is not new, but it is interesting as part of the larger picture. Wikipedia blames the indigenous culture, but these people are not the &quot;buyers&quot; fueling this--the well hidden &quot;elite&quot; are. According to Under The Same Sun (Canadian charity) cases have also appeared in Kenya and the Democratic republic of the Congo in 2008, and Burundi and Swaziland in 2010. </p>
<p>It is not organ trafficking, but hands, arms legs, skin, faces, genitals, etc. are removed form living people allegedly for &quot;witchcraft&quot; and the shaman is the middleman--the buyer always unknown. Sometimes graves are dug for whole bodies.</p>

It is true that there is a link between elections and a rise in attacks on persons with albinism,” Ernest Kimaya, chairman of the Tanzania Albinism Society, told Reuters. “It is something that we are aware of.”</p>
