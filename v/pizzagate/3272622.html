<p>Lets begin early on in 2010, as Marina makes one of the earliest appearances with Jay Z in Picasso Baby, mixing her in with the hip hop stars already under Bronfman financial control. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.universal-music.de/jay-z/videos/picasso-baby-a-performance-art-film-326307">https://www.universal-music.de/jay-z/videos/picasso-baby-a-performance-art-film-326307</a></p>
<p>In May 2011, Marina appears with Hannah and Clarissa Bronfman at the MoMA Annual Party. Another interesting note - Mayor Mike Bloomberg was also in attendance. Marina directed the gala later this year. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.patrickmcmullan.com/events/5b3ef4dc9f9290667643f748/">https://www.patrickmcmullan.com/events/5b3ef4dc9f9290667643f748/</a></p>
<p>Marina\'s has big ideas in her head for the MoMA Gala, and sets out hiring her actors. </p>
<p><a href="https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/10/marina-abramovic-moca-gala.html">https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/10/marina-abramovic-moca-gala.html</a></p>
<p>Marina\'s gala comes to head - heads on tables, her naked body as a centerpiece and all the attendees wearing lab coats, and a Debbie Harry cake. All for the mere price of $2500+ per seat with 750 guests.</p>
<p><a href="https://wwd.com/eye/parties/marina-abramovic-supplies-heady-dialogue-at-moca-gala-5368178/">https://wwd.com/eye/parties/marina-abramovic-supplies-heady-dialogue-at-moca-gala-5368178/</a></p>
<p>Not everyone was happy with the demeaning treatment of the actors or had the same perspective of Marina\'s presentation as &quot;art&quot;.</p>

<p>The MoMA event was a smash for Marina, propelling her in many directions, one being a video game created in her honor in late 2011. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/2011/09/16/pippin-barr-man-behind-the-marina-abramovic-video-game-weighs-in-on-his-creation/">https://www.villagevoice.com/2011/09/16/pippin-barr-man-behind-the-marina-abramovic-video-game-weighs-in-on-his-creation/</a></p>
<p>The event propels Marina into her next venture - the HBO documentary, The Artist is Present, in 2012. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcmcEZxdlv4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcmcEZxdlv4</a></p>
<p>In 2013, Marina decides that she wants to open an interdisciplinary performance and education center. Lady Gaga, a friend she had helped kick a marijuana habit, helps her launch the fundraising event.</p>

<p>Marina seems to hit a dry spell, doesn\'t seem to appear in any notable events again until 2014, when she\'s hired to do an Adidas commercial for the FIFA World Cup, and fails miserably. That can\'t be good for funding.</p>

<p>This latest event at the MoMA is to bring her name into light again and to drive up funding for an upcoming book.</p>

<p>Leaks of Marina\'s book comes out and her edgy ways cause huge upset, undoubtedly killing sales and alienating some of her previous donors and financiers. She earns herself the #Racist title.</p>

<p>November 2015 brings on further hard times, she\'s now facing a lawsuit by former lover and art collaborator, Ulay Laysiepen.</p>

            Marina appears in the Wikileaks Podesta emails. People outside of the art world start looking up #SpiritCooking and labeling previous works of art as "Satanic". Emotions/imaginations make up alternate stories for pics.

            "If it bleeds, it leads". No news is bad news (as we've learned from

            ). What genius timing for her name to be propelled to the front pages - just in time for that book to hit the shelves, for new &amp; curious viewers.

           <p>
            In March 2017, Marina hooks up with Bronfman pal Avrich to do a documentary for the art world - Avrich has also done work on pals Jeffrey Epstein &amp; Harvey Weinstein. Still needs $ for the museum &amp; new eyes = $.

           <p>
            In Oct 2017, Marina realizes that she'd fall short on the $ to upkeep the Performance Art Museum/School, and decides to scrap the plans.

           </p>
           <p>
            Investors for the Kick Starter are now pissed and want to know what they're getting for their investments. Larger donors received a Power Point presentation for their $.

           </p>
           <p>
            Marina is pissed that news articles have questioned her squandering of investor's money. She retorts that entrance to the gallery was "free". Just another poor financial decision for Marina.

           <p>
            In March 2018, Republican John Gibbs, who later became a HUD senior adviser, uses the Marina controversy to rile up the base - or to once again drive $? Unsure.. No news is bad news. Others have used to propel themselves.

            The #SpiritCooking dinners were a performance that she had done in the 1990's (the era of literal garbage art &amp; grunge), and it was being offered to investors who had donated more than $10k for the Kick Starter.

           </p>
           <p>
            Since her American ventures have failed, Marina is now back in Europe and her new digital experience performance opened in London.
           </p>
           <p>

           </p>
           <p>
            And rinse &amp; repeat - the #SpiritCooking rage was successful, she's a worldwide name. Still underpaying performers, and still reaping the rewards of bad news, as the Satanic Panic goes into play in Poland.
