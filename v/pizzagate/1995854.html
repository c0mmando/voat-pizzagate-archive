            There were connections within the Stratfor emails to corrupt groups in the Racine and Milwaukee area known as the Milwaukee 7. It is controlled by corrupt Boy Scouts Paul Ryan and Governor Scott Walker, and they are trying to control regional partnerships for area resources and industries, including the fresh water supply.
           </p>
           <p>
            Corrupt businesses in Racine are partners with several of the companies listed above, and they are all part of the inner circle tied to Agenda 2030. This is why the world needs to know about Racine, Wisconsin before it is too late. They are speeding up the process to gain control, and they have many layers of contingency plans. Do not underestimate them.

            If you are going to download any Stratfor emails from Wikileaks Global Intel Files -scan them. Though this may also have been put on Reddit to detract people from downloading them (there's so much disinfo out there!)

Stratfor gathers intelligence on private citizens and activists- I'm guessing anyone who digs too deep is an accident waiting to happen!

            The original emails are archived, not all scrubbed. There should be another Voat about Stratfor too
There is email id#19480 8/2/2007 with heading 'Headcount for Pizza'
 Wants to know how many people wanted pizza because there was only one slice and they wanted to know how 'thinly to slice it' 
Also mentions black &amp; white coding which was discussed regarding P0destas pizza-map
Another Stratfor email talks about setting up credit cards strictly for pizza...

             All stratfor emails I checked were mails sent TO stratfor.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sadly people are really that dumb to confuse emails that someone sent TO stratfor as conversation-emails from stratfor - and 90% of the rest are sheep, not any brighter, repeating that nonsense.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sadly the pedosatanists are correct in their opinion that people are dumb and can't recognize anything on their own, even if it is presented in front of their eyes.

            Once again, look all you want, but many have been removed. The really damning stuff is GONE. So better find a version that someone saved, if it's out there, bc what's on WL now is corrupted.

              I've posted multiple times about it with several examples. Just do a search for, say, soros. See how many results show up in, say, podesta emails. Then click on podesta emails and see how many actual results appear. You'll see how many are missing. Unless they've fixed the glitch since the last time I gave an example.
