<p>I never heard of the website ellacruz.org until now. Somehow or another, somebody was able to obtain the action plans or &quot;Plans for 2020&quot; from these organizations, and it makes for some interesting reading - plans that essentially call for the destruction of President Trump.</p>
<p>SHAREBLUE PLAN FOR 2020 ▪Nonstop coverage of the influence of Putin and Russia on Trump and his administration ▪Relentlessly beating the drum that he has no mandate, lost the popular vote, and is the least popular president elect in modern history.</p>
<p>MEDIA MATTERS PLAN FOR 2020 We are going to resist the normalization of Donald Trump. His every conflict oif interest, his every bit of cronyism, his every move toward authoritarianism, his every subversion of our democratic systems and principles, his every radical departure from foreign and domestic policy norms.</p>
<p>We are going to control every effort, at every level of government, to limit rights, rescind protections, entrench inequality, redistribute wealth upwards, or in another way, fundamentally undermine the tenets of egalitarianism that must serve as the bedrock of our democracy.</p>
<p>Here\'s How ▪Serial misinformers and right-wing propagandists inhibiting everything from social media to the highest levels of government will be exposed, discredited ▪Interest and social media platforms, like Google and Facbook, will no longer uncritically and without consequence, host and enrich fake news sites and propagandists. ▪Toxic alt-right social media-fueled harassment campaigns that silence dissent and poison our natural discourse will be punished and halted.</p>
<p>Success Will Look Like This: ▪Trump will be defeated, either through impeachment or at the ballot box in 2020 ▪The balance of power will shift b ack to Democrats ▪We will free ourselves from solely relying on the press</p>
<p>Ending Note As a result of our campaign urging major networks to correct course, CBS and NBC News publicly stated they would discontinue Trump\'s phone privilege. Eventually, others followed suit, and Trump\'s ability to control the news cycle from the comfort of his home was greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Media Matters further stated that they will push back on conservative misinformation across all media channels and specifically neutralize the effects and infrastructure of the newly empowered alt-right.</p>
<p>Media Matters advocacy - will be vigilant in holding news media accountable for even the slightest bit of normalization of Trump.</p>
<p>Media Matters is prepared to confront the US government under a proven and dangerous dissemble.</p>
<p>AMERICAAN BRIDGE PLAN 2020 The campaign to stop Donald Trump must be nonstop. We are uniquely prepared to take on the Trump administration, defeat Republicans who enable it, and rebuild progressive power in the states.</p>

            Do you think the MSM is owned by Shareblue and Media Matters?

           <p>
            What would lead you to believe such silliness.   The MSM is much, much larger than Media Matters which most people don't even know exists.  And the media's corporate parents are much, much larger.

            I just read an article about how Putin wasn't aware that in the US, the Government wasn't allowed to tell the news what journalists could and could not say about everything. The Media Equalizer.com has exposed David Brock's financial backing and agenda. However Alefantis and his relationship with Brock is well known since Pizzagate broke in 2016.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is anyone familiar with the Smith-Mundt Act and the changes that were made in 2013? It is my understanding that these changes started to allow the spread of false propaganda in US media. Prior to that, it was illegal.

             That's a bunch of nonsense.  There's was a guy here who was convinced the Smith Mundt was behind everything.  He created his on Smith Mundt forum here on voat.  Smith Mundt has nothing to do with US media.
            </p>
            <p>
             Smith Mundt is the act that authorizes the State Department's Broadcastng Board of Governors to create media services, these are the ones affect by the 2013 change.  You can look what the Broadcasting Board of Governors funds here

             The media outlets they created are aimed at foreign audiences.  The change in 2013 was to allow them to used domestically, using targeting immigrant communities. For example the Voice of America Somalia is considered to the best Somalian news source, the competing new source is run by the terrorist group Al Shabab.  The change allows VOA Somalia to be broadcast in the US, which has a Somalian immigrant community.

             When the Trump campaign met with Russians in Trump Tower, the best media profile of one of those Russians was by the Radio Free Europe website.

               Yes, but that article does not support the claim of false propaganda being broadcast in the US.
              </p>
              <p>
               As the document states
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                The 2013 Amendment is neither a dramatic breakthrough in government transparency nor a harbinger of an Orwellian state.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               That's a very mild article.  It does not identify any abuses, it says they could happen.   And it's not against domestically broadcasting BBG produced material, it just says, it should be attributed which seems fairly reasonable.  This is a safeguard against future abuse, not against active practice, because the norms of what the BBG media outlets do, did not change at all with the 2013 law.  They try to produce accurate journalism, rather than crude propaganda.
              </p>
              <p>
               We are now 5 years from the passage of this law.  Are there any examples of false propaganda being pushed from BBG productions?
              </p>
              <p>
               As I note all of this, the Democrats on the Foreign Affairs Commitee say Trump is trying to force out the BBG CEO and install a guy who produce Trump friendly news.  This would be illegal because the BBG board is supposed to select its own CEO and the reporters who work at the media outlets are supposed to be independent.   We shall see if this is another norm that Trump tries to violate for his benefit.

            I can't think of anyone who deserves less of a megaphone for his ideas than the super awkward ex-boyfriend of Innocent Pizza Chef James CIA Rothschild Alefantis. Brock is kind of like the 51st least powerful person in DC. A pizza delivery guy for the Rothschilds' abandoned puppies. If I write a book about myself, call myself "Media Matters for America" and my best friend is John Podesta, that automatically equals "Yay, how to get a spot on NPR and brainwash liberals: be friends with everyone who hates America." News flash, no one cares, traitors. Aborting yourselves out of existence and bringing in fake voters on buses is starting to become too obvious. No matter how popular you are on the mainstream media circuit, you still get to burn in Hell after you die the first death. Too late for you, David Brock.

            All of these tactics have just caused Trump's base to dig in and support him more fiercely.  They are so out of touch they can't even see how ineffective they are.

            This post seems like more of partisan pro-trump cheerleading than anything, with a pretty flimsy relevance to pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Trump squad has it's own propaganda arm known as Cambridge Analytica. They serve to boost his reputation and provide good PR for him on internet forums where the truth movement congregates. I have no doubt they are trying to "merge" the conspiracy community with a partisan right bias, on this very sub.
           </p>
           <p>
            That seems to be why most pro-Trump stuff is left up, and anything critical of him is removed, even if there is a clear relevance to PG.

              Yea, on the shit that isn't even relevant or has a blatant partisan bias. I don't see the mods doing a very good job of calling that out, so somebody has to do it.

              The more we incrementally lean into the conservative-right side of the paradigm, the less of a wide appeal our investigation has. Picking favorites and cheerleading for political demagogues like Trump (who himself has a slew of rape allegations and connections to elite pedos) to save us.

             The One Thing No One Is Mentioning In Their Barney Frank Tributes: The Prostitutes
"In 1989 it was discovered that Barney Frank's boyfriend, Stephen Gobie, whom Frank had once hired as a male prostitute, was running a male-brothel out of the Congressman's home. Frank claimed he did not know about the prostitution ring in his home, but he did use the power of his office to "fix" 33 tickets for Gobie. And he knowingly wrote a misleading letter to Gobie's probation officer in Virginia. Frank received a "reprimand" for fixing the tickets. Gobie maintained that Frank knew about the prostitution ring operation in his home."
