            I have some questions about this case.
1. It is claimed that the mother and boyfriend coached the kids into telling this tale to smear Dearman. Why not make up something less outlandish like simple child abuse? Or drug/alcohol problem?
2. The children gave a complete and extremely detailed description of the atrocities they witnessed and we're made to be a part of, including highly detailed information on where to find these hidden "torture chambers and what could be found there. Has any investigator gone in the school to look for themselves?
3. What of the medical examiner's findings that the mother claims were found to be consistent with the alleged abuse? (I'm assuming their rectums were abnormally large and scarred.) 
4. Has no one accused by the children to have devil tattoos on their privates been made to lift their skirts?
5. How could children this young have detailed knowledge of how to inject a baby to put it asleep, hang upside down, bleed it out, and cut off a baby's head unless they actually saw it?
Everyone has seen a child lie. They fidget,  their eyes dart around and the speech gets quiet. These kids did nothing of the such. Plus they told additional info that I don't think a person coaching them would think to include.

            We would be getting a lot more coverage for these kids if the mods here weren't hampering our efforts.

             something Alex Jones said sans proof
            </a>
            (or reason) was posted, the mods fought for it to remain, saying we don't need proof, just a link to someone like Alex Jones saying it (in this case, he was alleging that Michael Hastings had been an undercover govt agent!!)

            Well, apparently the Mother and grandparents of the Hampstead children believe that the girl in the Audi commercial is indeed Victim A (the Hampstead girl). In this article

            , there is a rundown of the similarities of facial features that do support the theory.

            Unfortunately due to the interesting climate here at Voat, the only way to slip this info to you is in comments.

            I too have been researching this case for some time.  I drove through the area at dusk a short time ago and felt so helpless and angry at the thought that in any one of these affluent houses or buildings - many of which sit in large grounds and well set back from the road in wooded land behind walls and gates - that a child or children could well be suffering.  I used to live in Hampstead back in the late 90's and shared my apartment building with a gay guy who regularly went late on to Hampstead Heath, a large wooded area known as a gay cruising area.  He returned one night in a state of shock and told me what he'd witnessed.  I didn't believe him so we went back to the same area in my car and We crept through to the same area and I also saw a vast number of people all involved I what appeared to be a coven meeting with people in robes and many disrobed completely and having sex out in the open in combinations of twos and threes and with absolute abandon whilst some chanted in monotones, there was a small fire burning and lanterns placed around.  At the time I found it disgusting to see but waved it off as one of London's many idiosyncrasies.  I've learned much since then.  Hampstead is a very spooky and ethereal place.  I believe these children wholeheartedly.  Yang I'm in London.  Anything I can do just shout.

             WHAT are the CHANCES that Ricky Dearman (UK, accused, Satanic Cult Leader) + CNN  (Clinton News Network) + Haitian Orphanage are all connected together IN ONE VIDEO? Here it is:

             </a>
             I really hope and pray His children are reunited with their mother and safely out of his demonic clutches. Disgusting injustice and even more worrying now Ricky Dearman is connected to the Haiti orphanage by way of work via his voice over tape!    (

             ) ever since I saw him 'ACTING' in the BBC1 ( contrived interview-
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqyRG9iHessYouTube">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqyRG9iHessYouTube
             </a>
             ) with Victoria Derbyshire "debunking" the very disturbingly detailed and emotional testimonies of HIS CHILDREN as FALSE!!!! The BBC Channel is supposed to be the most trusted NEWS channel here in UK (I am Disgusted). THEN when I watched the interview of James ALefantis and Megyn Kelly I had flashbacks to the BBC1 interview in 2014 and the similarities to this Hampstead Cover-Up case, It dawned on me how we have been hoodwinked for years! USA MSM Just the same, because they have the same connections in common. Thank God this is all being exposed - and hopefully imprison these sick-pedos!     THE FOLLOWING RELATE TO OTHER UK PEDOPHILES (just in case its useful for research) : 
This must be the most comprehensive information/vids/newspaper cuttings/reports etc., on the British pedophiles ever. I have not read all of it as it would take months!

            This story needs much more attention. I did an exposé on this case here. I tried to pull as many details and facts as I could from their and their mother's testimonies and enumerated them so that you don't have to watch the whole 5 hour long testimonial video. Thread here:
