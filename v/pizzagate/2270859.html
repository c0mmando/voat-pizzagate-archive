            Don't even get me started on those "men in space".  lol   Serious science up there making pizzas...etc.   How about Canadian astronaut doing a rendition of "Major Tom" from on board the International Space Station where he lives up in outer space.

             ...Eric Paddock (ID: JVyykL0B) KN NASA, Las Vegas and Uranium On(...) 10/23/17(Mon)19:34:33 No.146420733 568 KB 568 KB GIF Hello All,
            </p>
            <p>
             I want to talk to you about my brother Stephen Paddock and Pizzagate. I know a lot of you think there is something kind of conspiracy involving bots such as
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/NASAspecialops">
              @NASAspecialops
             </a>
             and while that is partly true, the conspiracy is far deeper than that.
            </p>
            <p>
             You see it began with President Truman and what the media are hiding from you, is that the buck stops with Stephen Paddock, my brother.
            </p>
            <p>
             As you will see here, Stephen was a pretty good bowler, he was the head of the NASA team
             <a href="https://twitter.com/floyd_party_o_4/status/917201801182699520">

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             During November of last year, just as Comet Ping Pong was being uncovered but before the raid… Stephen had managed to get in touch with his estranged daughter via Big Cheese LLC, which happens to be an offshoot of rancine. At some point during the past ten years, Big Cheese LLC was directly in possession of Besta Pizza on Conneticut Avenue DC, it might blow your mind to know, NASA are the current owners of Besta Pizza DC and Stephen Paddock’s daughter is part of the Russian space program, which DC have kept hidden from public for years.
            </p>
            <p>
             Fond of anagrams, Stephen heard his daughter was on voat and asked me to do some trolling with a photo he left for her alongside that infamous roll of sellotape.
            </p>
            <p>
             So here’s the photo for Daisy, the skittles are a bowling reference

              And I do not know how I would find it on here, but like a year ago... someone was scouting Comet and took a photo of a government car parked there, the plates were run on here and showed the car registered to Jet Propulsion Laboratories.   Wish I could find that post and that photo.  Seems this forum is a bad place for archiving an investigation.  If I could just see every comment I ever made, am sure I commented on that article pointing out Jack Parson's the known occultist in Allister Crowley's inner circle was the founder of Jet Propulsion Laboratories.   Also on here people found links from Epstein to scientific organizations.  Another clue is in the hidden cam video of a high level Masonic initiation.... which showed the blood oath taken to go further in the society, then the prayer for the "one true light of science" (no longer God or Jesus).
             </p>
             <p>
              Its all directly tied to that Marina Abramovic and all the satanist stuff being posted by the crowd at the pizza place on their social media.  Crowley's books describe human sacrifice and sex rituals.  As far as the sciences.... hmm, its hard to explain, but its part of their craft... and Alafanus is a tiny player in it all... more major players would be the likes of Disney, or the members of his club called "The Uplifters" back in the 1930's... to include the heads of media networks and top celebrities....and the play they produced called "the uplift of lucifer".
             </p>
             <p>
              It can be seen what amateurs the pizza place crowd is compared to the big guys like Disney (or Obama, or Von Braun, or Parsons etc), in that children's series they produced... their subliminal messaging in that production was cheezy..... right in the beginning intro they flash on the screen "I love drugs" then "prove it".   Disney programming is much more subtle... btw, Disney is behind the production of more than just children's shows, and the rest of who's allowed to broadcast is in cahoots.
             </p>
             <p>
              There's a reason all those shows on TV script everyone cursing, even the children... or are typically about murder and other horrible things that would otherwise not be made manifest in society.  Call all those productions including the news... our media.  Just like in science class, a culture is created using media...same terms and same principle in society.  John Belushi's Animal House did not depict how college kids behaved, its the other way around.... after that movie was seen by all.... then is when college kids began behaving that way.  To quote Ozzy ... "the media sells it and you play the role".  Didn't he write a song titled "Mr. Crowley" too?
             </p>
             <p>
              Its a big club and we're not in it.
