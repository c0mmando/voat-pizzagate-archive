<p>Recently, a paedophile was jailed in Australia for abusing a girl. This is not part of the story. It turn out however, that this man was a criminologist who had written a book about one of the world worst pedophiles, called Clarence Henry Howard-Osborne. The book is called &quot;The Man They Called A Monster: Sexual Experiences Between Man And Boys&quot; - and is a pro-paedo book written at time when Pedophile International Exchange was a real organization.</p>
<p>This other pedo,  Clarence Henry Howard-Osborne, commited suicide after being accused of sexually abusing boys. This is where the story starts. After his death, police discovered boxes with photos and details on over 2500 child victims. Worse still, names of <strong>elite pedophiles from the upper class of Australian society</strong> were recorded.</p>
<p>What would you expect to happen? Police who tried to investigate get kicked out of the force and now the material is &quot;location unknown&quot;? Yep, exactly. It\'s that bad.</p>
<p>There are numerous articles covering this story, but probably the best analysis is this radio show between a conservative talk back radio host and a child protection advocate:

            Thanks, maybe we should start expending #pizzagate to cover that other operations too. The elite will be pleased to see that we toe the line of their globalist agenda.

            If you look at the profile (or to use an IT term and sort of a SWOT) the high-society, educated middle-aged man is a bulls-eye of they type of offender profile. In each of these international cases (Brit, Norway, AU, USA) pedo rings attract attention all the way to the top. To hell with this too big to prosecute excuse...I hope after Jan 20, Eric Princ's claims that tons of criminal activity (inc. pedo-rings) link the CF and criminals to the 650K emails found on Weiner's laptop.  Whether or not there's some (at least in the USA) systematic highly organized approach in the name of leverage, off-the-books black-ops funding, power, blackmail, control, diplomatic control (especially social and one part of the early mission of the CIA MK ULTRA Program) its nefarious, criminal and anti-life and needs to be burned down to the ground. An emergent decentralized network of independent citizens  must sine the light on this activity. Thank god for Wikileaks and other outfilts fighting the federation that wants control.

             "Privately owned forest groves were believed used in the US, Canada, France and Holland....The kidnapped children and teens were said to be stripped naked, raped, hunted down and killed.."

            The criminal justice system lacks the knowledge, skill, and motivation to get to the bottom of this crime conspiracy. The perpetrators of this crime conspiracy are clever, cunning individuals using sophisticated mind control and brainwashing techniques to control their victims. Law enforcement does not know how to investigate these cases. It is technically possible that these allegations of an organized conspiracy involving taking over daycare centers, abduction, cannibalism, murder, and human sacrifice might be true. But if they are true, they constitute one of the greatest crime conspiracies in history.” Page 23

            put "legg devine" into austlii.edu.au and Pandora's box will open for you. Husband and wife jailed without a day in court breaking the closest Australia has to a bill of rights (Victorian Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006) for breaking a law that doesn't exist in their state, religious vilification of the satanic pedophile cult otoaustralia.org.au I have the whole dossier and I'm working on a write up now about it for my 18C submission
See what I just uncovered here too:

             and down the rabbit hole you got. Australian government prosecutes it's own citizens living abroad for disrespecting The Australian government's direct involvement in issuing passports to Russian boys to be raped in 20 countries filling two passports with stamps without a DNA test - then says it's homosexual vilification to disrespect Mark Newton and Peter Truong.

             breaking on that pizza gate thread. The ex-Australian cop done for drug supply exposed on 4 Corners by gay chris masters who is trying to cover up for the dutch pedophile got his 16 year old cambodian wife pregnant and fucked her at 15. See the links on the thread. Australia projects it's pedophilia all over the world.

            It is great we are looking into everywhere.  Stopping it in the US won't stop it for long if we don't tackle it globally.  They will burn for this.

            To be fair, the far right in the US has been saying the same about our "elite's" for a long time now. Not saying this isn't going on, but just to keep a balanced mind, it should be pointed out that the far right is well known for wild conspiracy theories (that might even be real, who knows) at times.

            Thank you for sharing!
But I noticed you wrote
            <strong>
             "Pizzagate is actually starting to seem pretty tame compared to what the fuck went on/is going on in Britain."
            </strong>
            What a lot of people looking into PizzaGate fail to understand is, it is exactly the same and it's all connected. PizzaGate is not just about a pizza place or Podesta emails. It's a large elitist, entertainers and royals ring of sick sick people, doing absolutely horrible things to children. It is far more deep, dark and widespread than most people can imagine.

             Yes, if I had votes left I would give you one. It's global and its basis goes WAY back in history.

            <p>
             It's evil manifest.  Yes, I believe in the Bible and I believe in demons. It's all in the Bible. People can dispute it all they want but it's a fact. Sadly, so many don't believe in God or the authenticity of the Bible, but that's really all a part of keeping people blinded from the truth in the world that we are seeing today.

            This might sound like I'm nitpicking but I wish you would edit the word conspiracy (two or more people colluding to do something illegal or wrong) to theory ( a supposition of ideas intended to explain something) .

               I have no doubt is firmly grounded in fact.
              </p>
              <p>
               You can believe anything you read if you wish but I am going to keep a somewhat skeptical mind because the people I have to convince aren't professional conspiracy theorists, they are everyday Australians and if I present them with the extreme it just makes it so much easier for them to doubt everything.

                Yeah I guess you understand cognitive dissonance then.  I understand your skepticism and reasoning in this case.  I have my doubts too - all I know about Ritchie was he could bat against leg-spin pretty competently.  However, after seeing all the celebrities at Marina Abramovic's 'shows' I have to wonder about what else we can't imagine.

                BTW Good luck getting the proletarians, plebians and general brainwashed masses to swallow their red pills.

               Agree.  And this: I keep reading from various sources the real reason Belgium's King Albert II decided to abdicate was because he had been identified as one of the perpetrators by Dutroux's victims.  Ordinary people all over the world have been duped.

              Indeed. Above Gough Whitlam, Kim Beazley and Paul Keating it is the Richie Beneud part that was the most earth shattering, even comical. I'm still up in the air, part of me says it's just too ridiculous and the other part goes along with it because after examining Fiona, unless she is a pure fantasist, I give her benefit of the doubt. The main thing that made me believe her in the first place is the fact Antony Kidman fled as soon as she went public with the allegations and the Kidmans have never addressed the allegations.. And her story and recounts are solid as fuck.

               I read Cathy o' Brien's story ten years ago and I too thought that far fetched,THEN. Been down too many rabbit holes lately to not keep an open mind from now on.

               I think that she probably was really screwed up psychologically by some 'treatment' and any actual truth she remembers was blurred in with a massive amount of false memories to make her story seem less credible. It seems a lot of of the accused were from one side of politics. As for John Kerr and Gough Whitlam being gay lovers..well that's an interesting one, certainly was a massive public fallout to end their relationship haha.

                You are probably right. What do you make of Antony Kidman though? I've been fascinated with him ever since I heard about this. He is an EVIL looking bastard at the very least.

                  Not a public face like Fiona, no. Though apparently a lot of other witnesses have come forward since. The thing is that her story whether true or not, is a true story to many around the world by the sound of it. The child hunting thing is apparently a documented thing that these cults get upto. Also here's another page on Fiona's story you've probably come across

             Yes, this case has been a part of my research also... absolutely sickening shit when you get into the survivors' accounts and the photo-evidence provided(blurred but probably still nsfw).
This case holds some very particular tid-bits of information that all-but confirm an underlying theme of satanism/hermeticism/some sort of hybrid 'shadow' religion, permeating the pedo ring(s) (whether international in scope, or just local to a particular country).
            </p>
            <p>
             I cannot go into much detail yet as I'm still piecing a rather morbid puzzle together, but my research is indicating that the occult aspect of this is becoming frighteningly real.

            I have saved this thread, I would like for us to use this thread(or perhaps even another with specific purpose?) to create a compendium of potential leads/lines of inquiry/persons of interest, regarding the Australian side of all things pizzagate(from the pedophillia ring(s) to the DNC/CF donations and everything in between and beyond).
           </p>
           <p>
            I will be compiling some of my own research at some point, into mindmaps and infographics, etc, in order to better present my concerns and findings - I will need the help of others who are more 'in the know' about previous and current cases of abuse/disappearance involving children in Australia, though, so please post anything that you think may be relevant - I will surely comb through as much as I can as quickly as possible, as I have all the time in the world to do so.

             The two most notorious Australian pedophiles dabbling in cybercrime were Peter Scully and Matthew Graham, both from Melbourne. Scully fled Australia after fleecing 20 investors of somewhere between $1.8 million (
             <a href="https://archive.is/GtGxn">
              https://archive.is/GtGxn)
             </a>
             ) and $2.68 million (
             <a href="http://archive.is/VyNs6">
              http://archive.is/VyNs6)
             </a>
             ) in a fraudulent property scheme. He faced 117 counts of fraud, and was known to have pimped his 16 or 17-year-old Malaysian girlfriend as an escort.
            </p>
            <p>
             In Indonesia, he began making torture videos involving children to live stream on the dark web to customers in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Brazil. He was paid somewhere around $7,000 U.S. for each video. He sometimes used the aliases Peter Ridell and Peter Russell, and ran an .onion site called No Limits Fun. His most notorious video, called Daisy's Destruction, depicted the rape and torture of a five-year-old girl, who survived the abuse. He was caught in early 2015 after Dutch law enforcement tipped off the Philippine police (
             <a href="http://archive.is/oXR0E">
              http://archive.is/oXR0E)
             </a>
             ).
            </p>
            <p>
             He pleaded not guilty in June 2015 (
             <a href="http://archive.is/N8dIV">
              http://archive.is/N8dIV)
             </a>
             ), and later blamed one of his accomplices, 17-year-old Carmen Alvarez (whom Scully met when she was a 14-year-old prostitute), as the mastermind behind the operation (
             <a href="https://archive.is/BJZ3b">
              https://archive.is/BJZ3b)
             </a>
             ). Interestingly, the documents from Carmen's first deposition were destroyed in a fire in Jan. 2015. Another woman, Liezyl Magallo, also helped Scully torture his 11 victims (
             <a href="http://archive.is/5TAhF">
              http://archive.is/5TAhF)
             </a>
             ). Four men--Christian Rouche, Alexander Lao, Marshall Ruskin, and Haniel Caetano de Oliveira--were also charged in the case, but the article doesn't clarify how they were involved.
            </p>
            <p>
             Scully's lawyer, Alejandro Jose Pallugna, resigned from the case in Feb. 2015 because he said Scully was too demanding and treated prison like a private resort (
             <a href="http://archive.is/WhvqE">
              http://archive.is/WhvqE)
             </a>
             ).
            </p>
            <p>
             Scully's youngest victim was an 18-month old baby. At least one girl, 11 or 12-years-old, was strangled after being raped, and then buried under the floor of one of his houses. Two other young girls were forced on camera to dig their own graves, but they managed to escape.

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             "Prosecutors allege that Scully directed a video involving torture and horrific injuries to an 18-month-old baby and participated in many debased acts against children. Prosecutors said he was for several years the mastermind of a worldwide syndicate selling extreme videos of child sex and torture."
            </p>
            <p>
             Daisy's Destruction has become a highly sought-after video, as you can read here (
             <a href="http://archive.is/j3Dzo">
              http://archive.is/j3Dzo)

              http://archive.is/Je303)
             </a>
             ). The second link seems to be an inaccurate description of the video, because one of the MSM articles cited above stated that the girl known as Daisy survived the torture. Some people have also attributed a video called Dafu Love, which may not exist, to Scully, but other people say the video is an urban legend based on a creepypasta that was itself based on Daisy's Destruction. You can read about it here (

             A May 2016 article (
             <a href="http://archive.is/oIkkD">
              http://archive.is/oIkkD)
             </a>
             ) identifies a young man named Matthew Graham as a notorious pedophile enabler known as Lux, who once ran a darkweb site called Pedoempire.
            </p>
            <p>
             “He was – to law enforcement agencies around the world – one of the ‘world's worst’ online paedophiles. He admitted 13 charges, including the unthinkable crimes of advising a Russian man how to abduct, rape and kill a five-year-old girl and encouraging a British man to rape a disabled girl in his care. The pay-off for Graham would be the right to host the resulting videos on his empire. In the only world he engaged with meaningfully, he was all-powerful.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Graham did business with fellow Melburnian Peter Scully, now facing murder, rape and human trafficking offences in the Philippines. Scully made a video called Daisy's Destruction featuring the alleged sexual torture of a four-year-old girl. Graham also procured videos from another Melbourne paedophile, whose name cannot be published because he was filming his niece being abused, in Cranbourne.”
            </p>
            <p>
             This article (

             </a>
             ) mentions two other Australian pedophiles, Michael Refalo and Hilton Reece Munro, who victimized Philippino children and made pornography. “Philippine investigators have identified Cebu as the key hub of a billion-dollar cyber-sex industry where children, including toddlers, are forced to perform sex acts that are streamed online to paedophiles around the world.”

             Thankfully in Australia's case, the (far-right) conservative media is on this one. Not that anything is happening, but no-one is calling it a conspiracy. I wish the media would put some more pressure on the government to do something, or maybe they know there is no point as the paedos still run the government. I will post any news or updates I hear.

              Unfortunately it's very apparent that we can't trust our media or government either - I mean, that one's kind of a no-brainer...
             </p>
             <p>
              Of course, at some point, if anything uncovered is to be brought to light, some form of media push will be required - personally I'm not sure how I will proceed if something actionable surfaces from my own efforts, because trust.
             </p>
             <p>
              Any suggestions as to how we can be assured of fair and genuine coverage, should we find the 'smoking gun for australia'?

             John Kerry's shock resignation sent chills up my spine, when I came to learn that he had recently been in London, around the time pizzagate broke and around the time that Assange finally was questioned by Sweden. I think he's tucking tail and running, from an inveitable fallout.

              Just for the record. Our swedish prosecutor never met Assange. She is just playing her part of the charad. I am assamed of being swedish. The swedish people only care about shopping and celebraties and themselves. They still think we live in a democracy and the MSM, even the so called public service(funded by the taxpayers) are completely corrupt and pushing out the propaganda. I am so angry and frustrated I dont even want to meet people any more because they refuse to listen on anything that they consider negative. If we dont solve this there will be no future, it is that simple.

              I spoke to a turkish guy yesterday and he said that all the turkish newspapers are covering this and that they consider the pizzagate to be true. At least that is one positive sign. Cant confirm it since I dont speak turkish.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thank you all for not giving up and for your courage! It means a lot not to be alone. Please continue to investigate and get the word out! Take care!

               To be quite honest, I have absolutely no idea what to think of Assange being 'questioned' and the otherwise high probability that he's no longer breathing.

               Is there any way that you can expand upon what you know about Ingrid "playing the part"? There's so much speculation that it really makes my head hurt - I'd really appreciate some sort of solid intel regarding his current health and whereabouts.

                Assange swedish attorney was not allowed to attend at the hearing. To me that makes all the alarm bells ring.Swedish media writes that Ingrid did not question him directly instead the questions where sent in advance and a presecutor,Wilson Toainga, from Ecuador handled the questions. This only makes sence if Assange was not in the Embassy. Basic logic conclusion, no solid intel I am afraid. The case is a swedish case and swedish law must be followed so why is it that the Assange swedish lawyer(who knows swedish law) was not allowed to attend and why was the swedish prosecutor not allowed to ask the questions? I know that Sweden always do what the US tells them to do no matter what it is. My country is a disgrace.

            Same thing in the UK. Eventually they had to establish a Child Abuse Inquiry into 'historic' child abuse, but our now PM kept appointing people to lead it who turned out to be cosy with some of the accused, presumably she thought no one would notice that? Now it's on its fourth Chair, loads of evidence has gone missing due to some 'technical error' and surviving victims are beginning to abandon hope that it will ever get anywhere. It started 3 years ago and has made no progress. That should make it obvious to anyone that this isn't just an 'historic' problem.

            It's a global problem, a current problem, and our world is run by these monsters and those they have cowed into covering up for them.

              So much of it out in the open and people STILL think Pizzagate is completely absurd?? I don't get it I really don't. What is wrong with people, why can't people use their brains anymore? I wonder if there's something all of us who understand what's actually happening, have something in common that could explain why we get it and others don't? Like we all eat or don't eat a certain thing, or we all had a similar experience as a child, or we all have wonky toes or I dunno, something.
             </p>
             <p>
              I hadn't thought that about Germany. What countries are definitely implicated so far? US, UK, Australia, Belgium, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Italy, I'm not sure about any others, I don't think I've read about any others. Maybe in other countries the top business people/bankers are involved but not so much the politicians? Or maybe they are just very good about covering their tracks?

               Spain and Portugal aswell. Of course I suspect they are here too, they are just better covered. There has been one politician recently convicted of pedo stuff, he got a slap to the wrist of 5 thousand € and the media stopped mentioning it. His name was Sebastian Edathy
              </p>
              <p>
               About brains: The media do this for decades now. There is a saying in german "Sprache formt Denken" meaning language forms thinking. If you are only fed weaponized misdirection and do not learn critical thinking and your critical thinking you have naturally is always tuned down it atrophies.
              </p>
              <p>
               There also is something called NLP - neurolinguistic programming. The media uses it
               <em>
                alot
               </em>
               It works hand in hand with something psychologists call "minimization of cognotive dissonance".
              </p>
              <p>
               The more gullible people are the easier it is to suggest ideas to them and the more they will fight contradicting ideas that come from the outside, because it collides with mantained ideas.

             It's so fucking sick that even when they actually have evidence of child sex abuse linked to a living politician they refused to prosecute on grounds of diminished responsibility.

              I know, I felt so sick when I heard about that. And what really gets me is that nothing else happens, the news moves swiftly on, no citizens marching about it, no media asking hard questions and making those involved squirm, no one gets fired. People just accept it and shrug it off, almost like it's a joke, like 'Oh yeah, those pesky paedophile politicians, always covering up for each other, eh? Well, what you gonna do?" It didn't used to be so bad like this. Even ten years ago, at least someone would have been fired or something would have happened, but now it's like the powers that be know that as soon as it's out of the news, people will forget about it. I think someone should hack all the TV channels and instead just have 24 hour coverage of the evidence of state crimes. And like the whole rick-rolling thing, there should be the best pizza gate documentary linked to in all kinds of places. Or like with Loose change, disguise a pizza gate documentary with the titles of popular movies and TV shows. I know it's a cliche, but people need to wake the fuck up!! Sorry about the rant, the Lord Janner thing set me off again...

             was set up to investigate in 2013 (still running). However, its terms of reference limit it to only considering institutional responses to child sexual abuse. While the stuff they have been uncovering is bad enough, who knows how bad are the cases that are off limits for them.

              Really? The police warned the newspapers about looking into child abuse in case it interferes with investigations? But that implies that there ARE any investigations. I wonder if newspapers were planning to look into it.

               There are investigations it's part of operation confier, they warned the press because the press were saying possible witnesses were not credible. It's actually unbelievable what they were doing to be honest.

             It's funny, no-one mentions the word "witch-hunt" when talking about rape hysteria on campuses. But powerful people get connected to paedophilia from a time when there was a legal public organization called Paedo's International Exchange and it becomes a witch-hunt. Go figure.

            Everyone in Australia should read Dr Reina Michaelson's account of how she was manipulated and obstructed by various higher ups, including TV execs, celebrities, politicians and police when she attempted to introduce a program to prevent child sexual abuse in Victorian schools in the 1980's.  Although she attempted to take the report off the internet, it's still up and available to read.  Australia is not the country you thought it was.

            This is fantastic material, i will carefully analyse. I gotta tell you guys, we do have a problem of pedophilia here in OZ. The problem is though, they always frame it as a lonely middle aged guy going to Thailand for sex tourism with teengage girls. Our population here is in deep sleep and people will laugh at you if you say the things I have been reading on here. Since I live here, I will see what digging i can do nd make any contribution to the discussion.

              New Zealand on the other hand is a social experiment being run out of Oxford and Tavistock.  It has succeeded brilliantly.  NZ is a post Christian consumer society where the compliant obedience to the global superstate has replaced God, country, and family.  Nobody cares about anything except what the media tell them to care about.  Free thought is dead.  As long as housing prices keep rising, nothing will change.

              It's worth noting that Senator Heffernan in his last speech to bring up that every Governor General since Phillip Ruddock has seen the list of prominent people, including a former Prime Minister.

               UK also had there's with Dunblane shootings with similar results in disarming the populous. Interestingly Australia has more gun ownership now then prior to Port Authur.
              </p>
              <p>
               I always think of Pavlovs experiment where putting the dogs in stressful situations made it able to reset the dogs temperate when considering Dunblane and Port Arthur. Port Arthur and the treatment of Martin Bryant is a very interesting story to dig into.

               Heaven forbid if you bring that up though, so many people are genuinely offended and give you that "are you a psycho like him?" look.

               PsyOps are rife in Australia, for the very reason stated above, regarding Aus being a US/UK owned experiment - I would go so far as to say, this country is the planned fallback, should the US crumble. The so-called elite will pack up and move shop over here, considering most of what they need and more, is already in place.
              </p>
              <p>
               We have to actively pursue this investigation in Australia too, in order to at least see what's coming - perhaps even stop it.

             Alan Jones was forced off the air indefinitely with 'chronic back pain - the day after Trump's landslide.

             Jones wasted no opportunity to attack Trump during the campaign. His vitriol was incessant.  He sounded desperate and as though he had a been paid to slam Trump everyday and at any opportunity. A real deal, been paid to play.  Alan Jones left the airspace another time too back in 2006 after being implicated in inciting the Cronulla Riots in Sydney.

             Bert Newton was the king pin of child porn at Channel 10. Apparently when studio 10 was damaged by fire a lot of evidence went up in flames. Bert was in exile for a while before Channel 9 resurrected his career. I Wonder what happened to his son, Matthew to turn him into a huge fuck up?
