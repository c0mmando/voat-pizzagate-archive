<p>Alleged pedophile and child-trafficker James Alefantis, one of the central figures of the pizzagate conspiracy, has been connected with convicted child-trafficker Laura Silsby and has painted a disturbing picture of a potential international orphanage network involved in the trafficking of orphans for commercial purposes involving the DC elites and CIA.</p>
<h1><strong>The Maccoby family and James Alefantis</strong></h1>
<p>James Alefantis appears to have strong ties with the Maccoby family.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/aR7LT">Michael Maccoby</a> is an anthropologist and psychoanalyst. He is also a member of the elitist Cosmos Club. He describes himself as a leadership advisor at NPH, which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuestros_Peque%C3%B1os_Hermanos">network of orphanages that span across Latin America and the Carribean</a>. He was also close friends with the founder, and was on the <a href="https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_fl/P19921">Board of the Directors</a> back in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://archive.fo/Blp2o">DC neighborhood meeting</a> regarding Comet Ping Pong operating post-midnight, Michael Maccoby stood up to threaten a DC official by saying that he will seek to remove anyone who opposes Comet <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mitalgandhi/anc3fmeeting">(31:42)</a>. This was during the infamous meeting where Frank Winstead had accused Alefantis of soliciting rapes and murders in 2008, where Alefantis brought upon a crowd 100 people to overwhelm the DC official.</p>
<p>Michael\'s son, <a href="https://archive.fo/pJEJh">Max Maccoby</a>, also has connections with the alleged child-trafficker. Max was the lawyer who <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/lIpLMAN/brock-court-documents-.pdf.html">represented Alefantis</a> for the $850,000 blackmail lawsuit involving  David Brock of Media Matters. </p>
<p>Alefantis also has close ties with Michael\'s daughter, Izette Maccoby Folger, and is frequently sighted on Alefantis\' Instagram making comments. Some speculate her comments to show pedophilic insinuations. They are frequently seen together in <a href="https://archive.is/cjzTq">gala photos</a> as well.</p>
<p>Michael\'s other daughter, Nora Maccoby, has also been seen in photos together with James Alefantis. Interestingly, in an interview with her on a video called <a href="https://youtu.be/pmd2Eey6CcE">“A CIA Upbringing”</a>, she has stated that her neighborhood is comprised of CIA agents, supporting the theory that Comet Ping Pong has links with CIA operations, being a 10 minute walk from the Maccoby house.</p>

<li><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1548634">80% of Comet Ping Pong neighborhood are CIA operatives</a></li>

<h1><strong>Child-trafficker Laura Silsby</strong></h1>
<p><a href="http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/King.pdf">Laura Silsby</a> is a child-trafficker who was arrested while attempting to smuggle 33 kids across the Haitian border without documentation after the 2010 earthquake. Though she was arrested on her second attempt at the border, she was previously caught attempting to load 40 children onto a bus in Petionville, after a concerned citizen reported suspicious activity to a police officer.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the orphanage that Laura Silsby was given children from in Petionville was the same orphanage as the one which <a href="https://archive.fo/pJEJh">Max Maccoby is a director at</a>, and is also part of the same orphanage network which Michael Maccoby coaches leaders for.</p>
<p>According to an <a href="https://archive.fo/ox7Fa#selection-423.0-425.82">interview with her lawyer</a>, Laura Silsby had received the children from a staff member at an orphanage called Friends of the Orphans. Friends of the Orphans is an orphanage branch of NPH, which in Haiti is referred to as Nos Petits Freres et Soeurs, which translates to “Our Little Brothers and Sisters”. Because the lawyer knew the orphanage\'s English variant, this demonstrates foreknowledge of the orphanage by  the actors in the scandal, probably Laura Silsby herself.</p>
<p>It was eventually discovered that her one-time lawyer, Jorge Puello, was also a wanted sex-trafficker in 4 countries, and is also listed on the Interpol for trafficking charges involving minors. </p>
<p>Laura Silsby\'s case was interesting because her documented plans revealed that she intended to give the children away for adoption. Further, with the <a href="http://archive.is/tFJ9h">intervention of UN envoy Bill Clinton</a>, renown for being a frequent flyer of the Lolita Express owned by child-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, she got away with a reduced sentence.</p>

</ul>
<hr />
<h1><strong>Friends of the Orphans, Gena Heraty and Bill Clinton</strong></h1>
<p>Interestingly there was no media coverage nor police probes into the orphanage. None of the representatives at the orphanage itself addressed the accusations in order to clear any misunderstandings. A Google search reveals that it was only the interview that even mentioned Friends of the Orphans, indicating a potential cover-up. </p>
<p>Investigators have uncovered that Bill Clinton, the man who intervened for Laura Silsby, had connections with the orphanage prior to the 2010 earthquake. <a href="https://archive.is/Q75wg#selection-251.0-251.85">According to an NPH staff</a>, Bill Clinton was scheduled to meet somebody within Friends of the Orphans in November 2009. This led to speculation that he had personal connections with somebody within the orphanage.</p>
<p>This turned out to be true. The manager of the Friends of the Orphans orphanage, <a href="http://archive.is/TDjrG">Gena Heraty</a>, had been awarded the <a href="http://archive.is/1Yo4l#selection-883.0-883.50">WJC Award</a> from Bill Clinton in 2012. Further, Bill Clinton had organised a $10 million fundraiser for Gena Heraty. It appears that Bill Clinton has more than enough connections with Friends of the Orphans, making it unethical for Bill to be the one to intervene Laura Silsby case, when he could have been involved himself. </p>
<p>The orphanage that Gena Heraty runs, St. Helene, strangely <a href="https://archive.is/f2173#selection-845.2-845.86">under-reported</a> the number of children after the earthquake by 100 children. Prior to the earthquake, <a href="https://www.nph.org/intranet/reports/docs/6/NPFS%20Haiti%20Programs%20Orphanage%202008.pdf">official reports</a> reveal that the orphanage housed 450 children, and according to a blog from Molly Hightower, an earthquake victim who volunteered at Friends of the Orphans, the St. Helene housed 450 children up to at least September 2009. There is no evidence that 100 children were transferred before the earthquake, which only becomes more suspicious when considering that the numbers match with <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/Clinton_Email_August_Release/C05766664.pdf">Laura Silsby\'s mission to collect 100 orphans</a>, per the Haitian Orphan Rescue Mission document.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1601255">The person in-charge of the orphanage that Laura Silsby was given children from was awarded by Bill Clinton in 2012</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1><strong>Mary Sue Conaway, the CIA undercover orphanage staff</strong></h1>
<p>Investigators had discovered that a woman by the name of Mary Sue Conaway works at NPH, for the <a href="https://archive.fo/vNAAY#selection-3537.0-3681.25"><em>secret task force</em></a> of NPH to undertake “special missions”. </p>
<p>Further, it seemed that she had worked for the head of the <a href="archive.is/VzClx">Visa Department at the US embassy in the Dominican Republic</a> at the time of the earthquake. Some people speculate that this could be the Dominican official Laura Silsby was referring to, per Anne d\'Adesky: <em><a href="http://archive.is/CAUuW">Ms. Silsby said her authorization to collect Haitian orphans and bring them to the Dominican Republic was from an unnamed Dominican official.</a>”</em></p>
<p>Is it ironic, that the woman currently in scrutiny regarding a child-trafficking conspiracy was once <a href="http://www.juvenilecouncil.gov/2006nationalconference/participantlist.pdf">Abduction Chief for the Office of Children\'s Issues Abduction Unit</a> back in 2006 in Washington DC, prior to becoming the <a href="http://www.expose-the-war-profiteers.org/archive/legal/2008/20080422-1.pdf">Special Assistant to the Deputy Secretary of State</a>? Seems like a convenient position to organize an elite pedophile ring.</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/gJQk9">According to Pakistan\'s Intelligence files</a>, Mary Sue Conaway is a CIA agent. Why does an orphanage employ an undercover CIA agent? Piecing things together paints a disturbing picture that the CIA is complicit in the trafficking business. This also ties back to Alefantis and the Maccoby\'s, who are believed to be involved in CIA operations.</p>
<p>A former CIA operative has attested that the <a href="https://youtu.be/lTMjjwZxaDg">CIA has a child-trafficking unit</a> in Washington DC. The evidence seems to support his word.</p>

           , Bill Clinton was scheduled to meet somebody within Friends of the Orphans in November 2009. This led to speculation that he had personal connections with somebody within the orphanage.
          </p>
          <p>
           This turned out to be true. The manager of the Friends of the Orphans orphanage,
           <a href="http://archive.is/TDjrG">
            Gena Heraty
           </a>
           , had been awarded the
           <a href="http://archive.is/1Yo4l#selection-883.0-883.50">
            WJC Award
           </a>
           from Bill Clinton in 2012. Further, Bill Clinton had organised a $10 million fundraiser for Gena Heraty. It appears that Bill Clinton has more than enough connections with Friends of the Orphans, making it unethical for Bill to be the one to intervene Laura Silsby case, when he could have been involved himself.
          </p>
          <p>
           The orphanage that Gena Heraty runs, St. Helene, strangely
           <a href="https://archive.is/f2173#selection-845.2-845.86">
            under-reported
           </a>
           the number of children after the earthquake by 100 children. Prior to the earthquake,
           <a href="https://www.nph.org/intranet/reports/docs/6/NPFS%20Haiti%20Programs%20Orphanage%202008.pdf">
            official reports
           </a>
           reveal that the orphanage housed 450 children, and according to a blog from Molly Hightower, an earthquake victim who volunteered at Friends of the Orphans, the St. Helene housed 450 children up to at least September 2009. There is no evidence that 100 children were transferred before the earthquake, which only becomes more suspicious when considering that the numbers match with

          <p>
           Investigators had discovered that a woman by the name of Mary Sue Conaway works at NPH, for the

           of NPH to undertake “special missions”.
          </p>
          <p>
           Further, it seemed that she had worked for the head of the
           <a href="archive.is/VzClx">
            Visa Department at the US embassy in the Dominican Republic
           </a>
           at the time of the earthquake. Some people speculate that this could be the Dominican official Laura Silsby was referring to, per Anne d'Adesky:
           <em>
            <a href="http://archive.is/CAUuW">
             Ms. Silsby said her authorization to collect Haitian orphans and bring them to the Dominican Republic was from an unnamed Dominican official.
            </a>
            ”
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           Is it ironic, that the woman currently in scrutiny regarding a child-trafficking conspiracy was once

            Abduction Chief for the Office of Children's Issues Abduction Unit

           </a>
           ? Seems like a convenient position to organize an elite pedophile ring.

           <a href="http://archive.is/gJQk9">
            According to Pakistan's Intelligence files
           </a>
           , Mary Sue Conaway is a CIA agent. Why does an orphanage employ an undercover CIA agent? Piecing things together paints a disturbing picture that the CIA is complicit in the trafficking business. This also ties back to Alefantis and the Maccoby's, who are believed to be involved in CIA operations.
          </p>
          <p>
           A former CIA operative has attested that the

            Have you looked into the house that Alefantis and Brock lived in? They had it demolished. Neighbors were upset due to historical interest. Seems like a brownstone op potentially that they wanted no trace of.

Has anyone discovered what happened to the little girl that was taped to the table in Comet standing with Alefantis?  He claimed she was his "god child".  Would think this is a VERY obvious lead to track down..certainly if the little girl is 1) unknown- that raises questions 2) known and missing - implicates Alefantis 3) known and parents know..then lets ask some questions and pull that thread...

            TLDR: Thanks for re-posting this information, all of which has been mentioned before, but try to be more attentive to logic and use of language. You seem to be implying things here that evidence does not support, while acting like strong wording makes the case. 
It is a real scandal, but jumping to conclusions and mischaracterizing facts doesn't help to actually get anything done.
Please do share your hypotheses, but identify them as such, so voat doesn't look like a haven for doofuses.

            Nice tying together of these existing threads and thoughts, but some questions:
           </p>
           <p>
            What does it mean to you that  Puello had "foreknowledge?" To me, it merely shows that Puello knew the relationship between NPH and FOO/NPFS
            <em>
             at the time of the interview.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            As a lawyer, wouldn't it be his job to know this?
           </p>
           <p>
            Wouldn't he naturally tend to describe the organization, in English, in the US, to English-speaking US persons, by its US name, as a US legal entity?
           </p>
           <p>
            Additionally, wouldn't Laura Silsby, a US person involved in Haiti charities, be likely to know of the NPH/FOO/NPFS relationship as a matter of course?
           </p>
           <p>
            The suspicious thing is Clinton bailing Silsby out when she got caught smuggling children, not the fact she knew the names of the orphanages. I am not trying to "debunk" anything or make excuses for those implicated in the scandal, just pointing out that this information is not suspicious. Try not to be offended.
           </p>
           <p>
            It makes the post look weak if people get the impression you are trying to imply something sinister, in the fact that the people being interviewed, had any knowledge of what they were being interviewed about. Of course they had
            <em>
             some
            </em>
            knowledge, ergo the interview.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or did you mean to imply something else entirely by "foreknowledge of the orphanage?"
           </p>
           <p>
            If so, what?
           </p>
           <p>
            Secondly, about the Conaways. So Mary Sue is a spook with diplomatic cover as a consular official. OK.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is the case in all consulates and embassies, the people there handling visas are wired into the intel world of the country they represent. Maybe her husband is also in intel, with cover only as her husband, or charity guy or something. 
In any case, the thing about the secret task force (Vern and Thomas Conaway, Mary Sue's family ) kinda seems like a stretch - the article you link basically describes their "mission profile" as transporting medical supplies, and says the son has "special needs" himself. But ok, maybe they are "special"  intelligence assets. Why not?
           </p>
           <p>
            And is it ironic Conaway formerly held a DOS position on abduction? Circular logic. Actually, this is one of the reasons, aside from having interacted with Silsby, that you are looking at her in the first place, so no, it's not ironic. Even fits in with her entire career history.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Why does an orphanage employ an undercover CIA agent?"
           </p>
           <p>
            Well, taking that at face value, if the agent is undercover, the orphanage WOULD HAVE NO FECKING IDEA they were a CIA agent. That is the point of there even being such a thing as an undercover agent!
           </p>
           <p>
            But back it up a minute: What orphanage
            <strong>
             employed
            </strong>
            Conaway? I thought she was employed by DOS (and purportedly CIA) as a consular official. We merely know via a blog posting that the Conaways have visited NPFS. Visited does not equal employed by.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorry if this doesn't sound supportive, but your post is full of jumps to conclusions and misleading language.
           </p>
           <p>
            And by the way I am not downvoting, just giving a little advice ;)

             This was to address the people who argue that Puello pulled the name out of his ass.
            </p>
            <p>
             NPH is known as NPFS, or Nos Petits Freres et Soeurs in Haiti.
             <a href="https://archive.is/0qKdd#selection-531.37-531.473">
              The staff call it that too

             , and the
             <a href="http://i.imgur.com/zrEsGkt.png">
              sign outside the collapsed building
             </a>
             shows that too. NPH/NPFS translates to "Our Little Brothers and Sisters" in English, and not "Friends of the Orphans". Therefore, reasonable to assume that Puello was indeed informed of this orphanage, either from Laura Silsby or his own trafficking connections.

            David Steele reports that the CIA has a child-trafficking unit in Washington DC. 
Wonder if the privately managed 'Farm' at CIA headquarters is still a fav location to take the kids to see the pigs and the chickens etc. The website says its closed for the winter so how is it that a 'Teri Weil', who happens to like pepperoni pizza, visits last week and gives it 4 stars. Must know the manager!

            Do you have any information on Edgar Maddison Welch and how he may relate in?  Didn't he do "charity work" at orphanages in Haiti?  Wasn't it almost proven his father was a convicted pedo felon?

            Nice! Upvoat for you. Re: that meeting about Comet, who was the other man that opposed CP? Frank Winstead supposedly worked for him ... think the other man's name was mentioned by Jamie T. I'm pretty sure I ran across it when I was going through Jamie T's website. I always meant to look that other guy up and see what the heck he's doing now. Maybe an investigator can talk to him. Would like to hear what he has to say and why he was so opposed to JA.

              I'm almost 100% sure that's where I saw this other guy (Winstead's mentor) mentioned. I'm pretty sure because I was going to do a search on him myself to find out where he was and why he hated Alefantis ... (so many reasons ...)

             Yes the NPH organisation itself seems to be an intelligence rooted network.

             Really nice work, potentially you could add information from the look into NPH.   Think of it in drug-trafficking terms:  James A.  Is the Dealer, CIA is the  organised crime gang that imports the product and wholesales it.  But the catholic  organisation  is farming the product.
