             Yes, think-, I do. No, it isn't.
            </p>
            <p>
             First one you mentioned, I missed - eyes glanced over it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Second one I saw, but thought it lacked information. I was only just made aware of the situation via

             in the last few hours and skimmed to find similar titles here.
            </p>
            <p>
             Seeing as how you're going to just assume the worst though, no matter what I say, I'll delete the thread now so that people can't brigade me.

            Until we see the full time-stamped cc camera video of CPP employees putting out the fire, citizens have been shown no EVIDENCE that there was a fire. The alleged fire was out before the fire dept. arrived. Any facts given regarding this story must be verified by the ORIGINAL fire dept. report and filed insurance claims by CPP.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Jaselskis, who uses the name Ryan Rimas in his acting and modeling career, entered the Comet Ping Pong restaurant on January 23 about 9:30 p.m. and set fire to curtains inside the eatery, federal prosecutors say. He was caught on surveillance video, which was released by the DC Metropolitan Police and ATF arson task force."
           </p>
           <p>
            THIS IS UNPROVEN. Ryan has been arrested and accused only. He has not had his day in court and been convicted of these accusations by a jury. In my opinion, Ryan does not look like the blurry video pic of the alleged arsonist in CPP. Saying the jacket Ryan was wearing is the same jacket worn in the blurry black and white CC video is SUBJECTIVE. These oddities makes one more suspicious that this is a potential false flag. What criminal would go out of his way to make sure he gets arrested???????
Where was he living during the 2 week gap between alleged crimes?????  Why do they call him a "Californian?"

             The editor of the magazine is Geordie Grieg who happens to have residence in London. I'm sure verification of this incident would not reach an editor of a magazine in London- when verification may only come via a United States Court Justice. I'm sure if we all paid more attention to details like this we could improve research on

             I'd say they do look similar though - keeping in mind that Ryan would likely not have put much time into styling his hair for the arson, if he did indeed commit it.

             I asked myself the same question.

            <p>
             Someone who wants to discredit pizzagate, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             Moreover, supposing he wasn't the arsonist, why was he trying to break into the Washington monument - for which he was caught 'red-handed' and then allegedly re-attempted after being released? This
             <em>
              screams
             </em>
             of wanting to be caught and made into a story; It's Edgar all over again(if Ryan was indeed the arsonist).
