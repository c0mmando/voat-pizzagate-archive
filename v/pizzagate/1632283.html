            Posted the other day by someone else - 
Not_A_Large_Duck 17 points (+17|-0) 1.2 days ago  (edited 1.2 days ago)
           </p>
           <p>
            When I talk to people I only discuss people like Dennis Hastert (Speaker of The House 1999-2007), Jeffrey Epstein (Very spicy, new charges have been filed against him beyond the initial 43), Jerry Sandusky (Caught raping a 10 yr old), the federal judge who is against Trump's travel ban and his connection to the youth support group that was shut down when someone raped kids, people with actual proven charges or very suspicious connections.
           </p>
           <p>
            I then relate how John and Tony Podesta are connected to Dennis Hastert by showing the email about his arrest and how they are casually still friends saying he should run off to a hidden island in Japan. I then show them the Podesta's art, Madelaine Mccann's date of disappearance (May 3 2007), and the date that John Podesta deleted all his emails (May 5th 2007). Then I show them the police sketches and say even if it wasn't them I have a right to be suspicious.
           </p>
           <p>
            Move on to Epstein and how Bill and Hillary are deeply connected and show them flight logs. I show them that Trump flew on it 1-3 times but banned Epstein shortly after. It's important to get Trump out of the way here. This and the grab them by the pussy is the only real questionable thing that is on record and neither means anything IMO. he flew around with Epstein, decided he was a disgusting piece of shit and banned him from his clubs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Usually I then tell them how the US is the country with the biggest problem with human trafficking, show them all the arrests that have been happening, and then show them the chat logs from the Freedomhost II leak that just came out. Show them that it is very very real. Nobody can ignore that the Freedom host dump is fake when you show them the investigation going on and the people's profiles.
           </p>
           <p>
            And then I say: "I don't even care if any of these connections are true, that doesn't make me believe it or disbelieve it but if 9 of my friends are international drug smugglers I think you would have a right to place me under scrutiny if there was a major drug trafficking problem going on just based on the evidence of my connections." I am not a tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy theorist, I am simply not going to ignore this. I will keep my eyes open for more connections.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also don't give Trump any bias support. I had a friend argue with me that his locker room talk in 2005 made them think he was a pig so I played Hillary's interview from around 1980 about winning the rape case of that 12 year old girl and I asked my friend, can people change or does this define both of them as a person? I am ultimately not concerned if someone is mysoginistic but I do think the casual dismissal of defending a pedophile rapist when even you don't believe they're telling the truth is fucking suspicious. I've also had similar conversations with my guy friends and women have plenty of "my boyfriends penis" conversations.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this gets traction I'll dig up links, I have a feeling most of us here can quickly run someone through what's been going on via google/duckduckgo, I think the trick is not to paint it as a vast conspiracy but simply something that reeks to the high heavens and has every right to be investigated by the government. It should also be all over the fucking press
           </p>
           <p>
            Also I point out that Pizzagate itself was what the press latched on to as a way to wash it all under the rug. "Oh no, this isn't about that pizza place at all, that was just the news trying to make it seem like a crazy conspiracy theory."

             .... and the fact that you state whether it's 100% true or not there is cause for alarm and investigation.
If you want to do a copy/paste write-up to go between the mckinney video with rumsfeld and her later tweet that is a summary of the known pedos like hasert and the like, along with the connection to podesta... I think it will fit there nicely.  I don't have the time right now to do a little paragraph with links for FB... but if anyone else will.. I will add it to post.  TY

             I'm hoping the encouragement in yesterdays exec order to share info between agencies and submit a report in 120 days are going to have them wanting to do major cleanup before they have to show trump what theyve been up to.

            Most likely I sound like a broken record having only four 'go to' videos (none about Satanism, Reptiles, Anunaki, Niburu, Fukushima, the Khazars or Pizzagate). While this one is off topic, it has many things going for it. The subject matter (medicine and Big Pharma) is already slightly suspect to most reasonable people. All of the information is sourced and well presented. It clearly demonstrates how gubmint and powerful corporations work together to the detriment of the common, decent American. 
When my mother agreed to watch "one, only one time, sit through one of those things you watch on the computer", I chose this one. When it was over, she said "I'll never give another dime to the Cancer Society!" (She's gone door to door for them for years.) Just a couple of days ago,  SHE ASKED ME to "pull up one of those videos on this Pizzagate mess"!

            This is exactly how I jumped in (only last week).  And I work in showbiz so I'm pretty scared of being outed as a conspiracy theorist.  On set, there is a sort of daily policing that goes on.  You can't be a trump supporter, you have to love Hillary, etc.  if it comes out that you belief system is not in line with the machine's?  I don't want to speculate.  I'm fairly certain I wouldn't work again and I'm only a middling person in the biz.
I'm still reeling, frankly.  This rabbit hole is so deep.  I have only one person to talk to about this in real life and when I share things with people, they read a bit, because I'm a trusted, sensible friend, and then they all have responded with a version of "that's too crazy, I can't/won't accept it because it's too hard".  I get it.  I'm sure I've done the same.  I watch friends take in the TV shows and the programming that is so impossibly obviously destructive.  I went from a pretty rabid, righteous left-wing Hillary police dog to a really confused individual who can't look at a TV but is suddenly hopeful about our new president.  So what you're doing DOES work.  For some.

             If you signed up with an email address, I'd remove it. Other than that, it's about as anonymous as anything else on social media.

             Thank you for joining in this. I find your story really interesting having come from the other end of the spectrum all the way down to the trenches of the hated, haha. Especially being a rabid Hillary supporter. It gives me hope, really. So thank you.
            </p>

             I only talk about this with my husband - literally no one else. And he is about the most level headed person I know and is never ever prone to conspiracy. He avoids social media like the plague while I'm all over it.  I told him that this means something to me and I have done enough research to know that even if it's found out that a fraction of this is true, then it's too much. Since he's the only person I can actually talk to, he lets me talk without arguing. And he's coming around in a big way.
            </p>
            <p>
             My son is in college and has become so "logical" and moving toward the liberal way of thinking that he blew this off immediately. When I told him to look into it on his own, of course he used Google and got nothing but the MSM version of the "Fake News" stuff.  I think he looked at me like I was a nutcase when I pressed it one more time so I stopped talking about it completely.
            </p>
            <p>
             And Trump? I don't know yet. I voted 3rd party because I have been a rabid Clinton hater since Bill was in office and then the emails were dumped so there was no way I'd give her my vote. Trump I didn't hate as much as everyone else, but I couldn't bring myself to vote for him, even though I was secretly wanting him to win. The jury is still out on him...I'm rooting for him but I wish he wasn't so petty and getting worked up over things that I understand he's been unfairly targeted for.  I can overlook all that though when there are much bigger issues at stake.   Nevertheless, I'm hopeful. Because he knows what's going on and as much as he may have had some corrupt business dealings, I'm still hopeful that somewhere under all that arrogance is a decent human being. So yeah, he's what we have and I'm thankful it's not the other way.

             not anon at all really, better to assume its all able to be seen by someone if they want.  However, power is in numbers and we can overcome by all shouting the same as we are doing now.  Trump just signed an exec order to inforce human traffiking violations etc only 2 hours ago.  You are right, it is working.  I've turned 4 hard Hillary supporters in only 48 hours.... and they were sooooo resistant.

            That's what I did.  I actually posted only factual already busted government involved pedo rings from all over the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            My best post was the one were I added 120 government employees and their crimes.

           <p>
            By then I think I had been censored tho..
           </p>
           <p>
            But I agree, facts only.

            Agree with this... I slipped in some references to the California arrests to non-red pilled coworkers this week, to help prep them for what's about to happen. It's very important not to argue, not to force the issue when people are resistant. Be logical, be patient...It takes time for people to be ready to hear some of these things. It's not their fault, just a life-time of social/media conditioning. Thanks.
