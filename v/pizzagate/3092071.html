<p>In this article we have pics of LH with her husband Adam Koffler at <strong>Art Basel Miami Beach</strong>.  I think Adam is heavily into Miami real estate. <a href="http://worldredeye.com/2016/11/george-lindemanns-housewarming-in-celebration-of-art-basel-miami-beach/">http://worldredeye.com/2016/11/george-lindemanns-housewarming-in-celebration-of-art-basel-miami-beach/</a></p>
<p><strong>Adam\'s brother is Logan Koffler.... vice President of BlackRock.</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Further in his resume....</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before joining BlackRock, Logan was a Vice President at Teneo Strategy, a global CEO advisory firm. He worked across clients - Fortune 50 companies, city agencies and NGOs - to design and implement public affairs campaigns, including strategies for traditional and digital media, corporate positioning and stakeholder engagement. He also served as a speechwriter for Teneo’s CEO clients and executive team.</p>
<p><strong>Prior to joining Teneo, Logan served as the Senior Foreign Policy Associate in President Clinton\'s Office and the Clinton Foundation. As the President’s primary brief writer on issues related to foreign affairs, Logan helped formulate the President’s position on sensitive geopolitical issues. He also worked in support of the Foundation’s international initiatives, helping manage relations with foreign governments and Heads of State.</strong> </p>
<p>Prior to joining President Clinton’s Foreign Policy team, Logan worked as the Special Projects Manager at the <strong>Alliance for a Healthier Generation - an initiative of the Clinton Foundation and the American Heart Association</strong>. In addition, he served as the Director of Communications for the Global Leadership Institute in Boulder, CO where he helped develop and manage a month-long program providing student leaders with skills and resources for social entrepreneurship. In 2007, Logan spent time with the Law and Justice Unit at ABC News where he co-authored news reports. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And apparently in 2007 Logan was at the <strong>Institute for Shipboard Education</strong> where he \'<em>circumnavigated the globe studying in 12 countries with <strong>guest professor Archbishop Desmond Tutu</strong></em>\'.</p>
<p>Desmond Tutu you say?  Voat post:</p>

<p>Edit 3; Desmond Tutu is ook 1 van de ambassadeurs, dit is alleen maar een gedachtenspinsel, maar hij heeft ook een Child youth care centrum. Richard Branson, een andere ambassadeur, was hele goede vrienden met nu veroordeelde Jeffrey Epstein (van Pedophile Island). Zijn eigen eiland ligt dr ook vlakbij. Nogmaals, dit is ook weer een gedachtenspinsel. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google Dutch translator: <strong>Desmond Tutu is also one of the ambassadors, this is just a principle of thought, but he also has a Child youth care center.

<p>..FBIAnon said that Muhammad Yunus needs to be looked into .. Yunus was a Clinton Foundation donor, and one of his charities, Yunus Social Business GmbH, teamed up with the Clinton Foundation in Haiti to &quot;solve social and environmental issues in Haiti by bringing sustainable, productive, and socially responsible forests to the country&quot; via the Haiti Forest initiative. …</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>These days, Professor Yunus spends a lot of his time travelling. Since stepping down in 2007 from the \'Elders\' – the elite group of elder statesman and world leaders that includes Nelson Mandela, Jimmy Carter and Desmond Tutu</strong> – to concentrate on his work (the first person to leave the exclusive group), he has become a perennial conference-goer. Today is no different. He bounces through the hallways of the convention centre hosting the One Young World conference – established to nurture the leaders of tomorrow – stopping occasionally to bat away praise or answer a question from a precocious young delegate....</p>
<p>&quot;After telling the youngsters at the One Young World conference – where he was greeted by the screams of 1,000 vuvuzelas – that they should \'take chances\', he confirms later that he thinks \'The world will be changed by young people. After all, it is my generation who got things wrong. We have created a world that is not happy. We created poverty and unemployment. But these kids still don\'t realise how powerful they are.\'&quot;</p>

<p>Hmmm... didn\'t we hear that same speech (more-or-less) just recently given by Prince Harry?  Just sayin...</p>

            Throughout her life, Branson has been a child welfare advocate. She established the Eve Branson Foundation and currently serves as director. This charitable organisation provides communities in Morocco with income-generating projects and training.[6]

            We are a small charity based in Morocco, spearheaded by Richard Branson's mum, Eve Branson. Our mission is to provide young people with valuable skills-training through our dedicated craft centres and to preserve traditional Berber crafts, enriching the lives of local families from Atlas Mountain communities. Since 2005, our collaborative programmes have made a positive impact in the region and we continue to work in close partnership with award-winning hotel Kasbah Tamadot.
           </p>
           <p>
            Richard agreed to buy the Kasbah on the condition that I would help the local Berber people living in the more remote surrounding villages. I grasped the challenge with both hands and heart, and the Eve Branson Foundation (EBF) was born.

            Florence recently joined the Board in 2017. The Granddaughter of Eve and daughter of Vanessa Branson, who set up the Hotel Riad El Fenn, Florence has grown up visiting Morocco. Florence is an artist, curator and astrologer. With each of these different practices she explores how humans situate themselves within their perceived ecologies – an investigation she feels is critical in this time of environmental crisis.

            Vanessa Branson (born 1959) is an English entrepreneur, who is the sister of Richard Branson. She is the founder of the Marrakech Biennale.
            <a href="http://www.marrakechbiennale.org/">
             http://www.marrakechbiennale.org/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Branson founded the Vanessa Devereux Gallery (1986 -91) in Portobello Road, London where she showed a number of emerging artists including William Kentridge’s UK debut exhibition. Along with Prue O’Day and Anatol Orient she initiated the Portobello Arts Festivals in 1987, 1988 and 1989.
           </p>
           <p>
            Between 1999 and 2004 Prue O’Day and Vanessa Branson curated the Wonderful Fund collection at the Museum of Marrackech.[1] This involved 15 people investing in the fund with which Branson and O'Day purchased works of contemporary art.
           </p>
           <p>
            She owns and runs Eilean Shona,[2] An island on the west coast of Scotland at the entrance to Loch Moidart where J M Barrie wrote the screenplay for Peter Pan.[3]

            Vanessa Branson has extensive experience as an hotelier and has created a retreat that combines the luxury of a boutique hotel and the charm of a family home. Eilean Shona House is the jewel in the island’s crown. Sleeping up to 20 people, it is perfect for family celebrations, Christmas and New Year parties, executive team building away weeks, well-being retreats or just a gathering of friends. Visit for weekends or longer and anchor yourselves back in a time when the stars shone bright in clear black skies and the only sound in the clear air was of rushing waters and calling birds.
           </p>
           <p>
            The classic Scottish façade of Eilean Shona House conceals a wealth of entertaining and living space. The interiors are comfortable and quirky rather than traditional and formal. The house, although large, is snug being insulated by thick well-built walls and centrally heated by a solid wood boiler supplemented with four glowing open fires and, unlike many other Scottish country houses, there is always lashings of piping hot water.

            I have my own ideas after reading that paragraph.

            In 2002 she developed the Riad El Fenn hotel in the centre of Marrakech, together with her business partner Howell James.

           </p>
           <p>
            ABOUT: El Fenn is as much a contemporary art gallery as beautiful boutique hotel.  Modern works from the collection of co-owner Vanessa Branson—the tycoon’s sister, and Marrakech Biennale’s founder—are ubiquitous.  Guests can dine below a Francis Upritchard chandelier, for instance, or bed up beside ink studies by Antony Gormley.  Set across three courtyards, El Fenn is a feast of marble pools, bougainvillea and metre-thick walls which block out the medina’s racket. Jemaa-el-Fna, Marrakech’s incredible centrepiece, is only three minutes away.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2005 she became the President and Founder of the Arts in Marrakech Festival, now known as the Marrakech Biennale.[4]
           </p>
           <p>
            She is a trustee of the British Moroccan Society],[5] and The Leila Alaoui Foundation, as well as a trustee for Virgin Unite. She is also on the board of trustees of Global Diversity Foundation.

            <strong>
             Now my head is spinning.
            </strong>
            She owns an island and she could very well be caught up with Arts &amp; Embassy vice. Wow. And she is connected to Marrakesh as well. And More.

            Father of Adam and Logan Koffler, Murray Koffler

             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Koffler
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Murray Bernard Koffler, OC OOnt (January 22, 1924 – November 5, 2017) was a Canadian pharmacist, businessman, and philanthropist. He was best known for creating the Canadian pharmacy retailer Shoppers Drug Mart, establishing the Koffler Centre of the Arts, Toronto Outdoor Art Fair, and an
             <strong>
              initial investor in the Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1946, he became a pharmacist at Koffler Drug Stores (established in 1921 by his father and pharmacist Leon Koffler). From 1968 to 1971, he was President of Koffler Stores Ltd. From 1971 to 1986, he was Chairman of Shoppers Drug Mart. He was appointed an Honorary Chairman in 1986.
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition to his business pursuits, Koffler was a community leader and philanthropist. He received the B'nai B'rith Distinguished Citizen's Award; the Canada Council of Christians and Jews Humanitarian Award; and, with his wife, Dr. Marvelle Koffler, the Israel Cancer Research Fund Humanitarian Award. He served on the board of governors of the Canadian Council of Christians and Jews, as well as those of Mount Sinai Hospital, the United Jewish Welfare Fund, and the Jerusalem Foundation, and is a past chairman of the United Jewish Appeal. In 1979, he was the Toronto Negev Dinner honoree.
            </p>
            <p>
             Murray and Marvelle established the Koffler Centre of the Arts in 1974. The Koffler and Koffler Gallery present a contemporary cross-disciplinary arts program including the Vine Awards for Canadian Jewish Literature and a diverse range of programs in theatre, literature and visual arts. The Marvelle Koffler Breast Centre and the Murray Koffler Urologic Wellness Centre were both established through their generous philanthropy to the Mount Sinai Hospital.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1969, Koffler rallied the pharmaceutical community, among others, to launch The Council on Drug Abuse (CODA), a charitable non-profit association with the mandate to prevent substance abuse through health promotion and education impacting children and youth. CODA develops/delivers cutting-edge, preventive drug abuse programs to youth aged 12–19 in 104 Canadian school communities which include students/teachers other youth/adults associated with high school and feeder schools, local community groups/social services/community centres/police and other points of community focus including culturally diverse groups/populations.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1971, Koffler and two other Jewish community leaders, Albert Latner and Ray Wolfe, purchased the Canadian Jewish News.
            </p>
            <p>
             Both Kofflers were major supporters of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. Both sat on the Institute's board of governors, and Murray was chair of the international board of directors. He was also chairman emeritus of the Canadian Society for the Weizmann Institute. Another of his contributions to the Weizmann Institute was his funding of the Koffler Accelerator—a sophisticated twin-tower instrument for nuclear research.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1979, Koffler opened the first Super-Pharm pharmacy, in Herzliya, Israel. Super-Pharm is still owned by the Koffler family, and there are currently 202 locations in Israel.

            <p>
             Gilbert de Botton (16 February 1935 – 27 August 2000) was a financial pioneer in the 20th century, who is considered the inventor of the open architecture model of asset management. He was reportedly fluent in nine languages, and was a prominent art collector.
            </p>
            <p>
             Gilbert de Botton was born in Alexandria, Egypt, to a distinguished Sephardic Jewish family. Among his ancestors was the rabbinical scholar Abraham de Boton. Gilbert was brought up largely by his mother's parents.
             <strong>
              His mother Yolande, a journalist and Israeli intelligence officer
             </strong>
             , died in 1959. He also saw little of his father, who was an oil company representative.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1968, when the British and French Rothschild banking houses decided jointly to establish an operation in Zurich, de Botton was recruited as its first managing director. He went on to serve briefly as president of Rothschilds in New York in 1982.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1983, Gilbert de Botton founded the Global Asset Management financial firm, a multinational asset management firm, later incorporated into UBS AG until December 2005, when it was acquired by Julius Baer.

             Moscow expels U.S. diplomat and wife

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             MOSCOW -- The Soviet Union charged Monday that a Leningrad-based U.S. diplomat and his wife were caught 'spying' and ordered the couple out of the country in a new blow to the deteriorating relations between the superpowers.
            </p>
            <p>
             In Washington, the State Department 'vigorously' protested what it called the Soviets' mistreatment of the couple and disclosed for the first time that two Soviet air attaches were expelled from Washington last month.
            </p>
            <p>
             A U.S. Embassy official said the timing of the Soviet move 'speaks for itself,' a reference to the Kremlin's attempts to counter global criticism of the shooting down by a Soviet jet of a South Korean plane carrying 269 people.
            </p>
            <p>

             <strong>
              David Augustenborg of the U.S. General Consulate and his wife, Denise Augustenborg
             </strong>
             , were detained flagrante delicto (in the act) in the area of Leningrad on Sept. 11 as they were carrying out an act of espionage,' the official news agency Tass said.

             <p>
              Oh, and Donald Trump used to privately dine with Epstein at his NY apartment. Some of the businessmen who dine with him at his home—they include newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman, banker Louis Ranieri, Revlon chairman Ronald Perelman, real-estate tycoon Leon Black [Apollo Global], former Microsoft executive Nathan Myhrvold, Tom Pritzker (of Hyatt Hotels), and real-estate personality Donald Trump—sometimes seem not all that clear as to what he actually does to earn his millions. Certainly, you won’t find Epstein’s transactions written about on Bloomberg or talked about in the trading rooms. “The trading desks don’t seem to know him. It’s unusual for animals that big not to leave any footprints in the snow,” says a high-level investment manager.

She continues to be involved with The Elders as a member of its Advisory Council, which she sits on in her capacity as Advisory Committee Chair of Girls Not Brides: The Global Partnership to End Child Marriage.

              Prince Harry's naked antics in a
              <strong>
               Las Vegas hotel room
              </strong>
              took his reputation as a party animal to new heights.
             </p>
             <p>
              The 27 year-old and a large group of friends including Arthur Landon, Tom “Skippy” Inskip and Cressida Bonas, his most recent girlfriend, spent a week on
              <strong>
               Sir Richard Branson’s private island of Necker
              </strong>
              celebrating the 27th birthday of the Virgin tycoon’s son, Sam.
             </p>
             <p>
              One friend, Rory Hoddell, joked; “Damn you jet lag!” while Dan Philipson, a friend of Prince Harry’s who dated Chelsy Davy following her split from the Prince, commented: “That is funny as fark!”
             </p>
             <p>
              Hours after they arrived, the Prince and four male friends hired a cabana at “Surrender”, a vast open-air nightclub based around a pool at the
              <strong>
               Wynn Encore hotel
              </strong>
              where he was staying. The cabana, which featured a red sofa, red stools and red curtains, and a large plasma television screen, had a view across the pool on one side and a balcony on the other side overlooking the Las Vegas strip.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was about 10 yards from a back entrance to the VIP section of the Encore hotel where the Prince’s £5,000-a-night suite was located. Surrender also features dancers in skimpy red bikinis gyrating against poles to loud music.

             <p>
              Stephen Alan Wynn (né Weinberg; born January 27, 1942) is an American real estate businessman and art collector. He is known for his involvement in the American luxury casino and hotel industry
             </p>
             <p>
              In 2018, Wynn was accused by dozens of people of sexual misconduct, ranging from harassment to forcible assault to coercing a female employee into sex; he denies the allegations.[9] Wynn stepped down as CEO of Wynn Resorts on February 6, 2018 because of these allegations.
             </p>
             <p>
              Wynn is known for amassing a large collection of fine art, often placing the pieces in his various casinos and hotels. In 2004, Wynn purchased Vermeer's A Young Woman Seated at the Virginals at a Sotheby's auction for $30 million. With the purchase, he became the first art collector to purchase a Vermeer painting in over 80 years.[44] It would be one of only two Vermeers still in private hands (the other is owned by Queen Elizabeth II). Wynn later sold the painting to the Leiden Collection owned by Thomas Kaplan for the same price.
             </p>
             <p>
              Under the direction of Steve Wynn, Wynn Resorts acquired Jeff Koons's Tulips at auction in November 2012 for approximately $33.6 million.[48] In May 2014, Wynn acquired PopeyeP from the same artist for over $28,000,000, putting the work on display at Wynn Las Vegas.
