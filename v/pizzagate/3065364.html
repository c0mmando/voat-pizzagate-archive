<p>Well here is what\'s alarming. In a video he mentioned having ties to the Philippine government and selling kids off to a group of government workers in one of his videos. I remember comments pointing it out in the video after I called it out on Voat. Thing is only he was arrested and all of the videos are gone. I had the video linked however the archived videos were also deleted. I also had a picture of him archived and it\'s gone to. Someone deleted it.</p>
<p>He mentioned it in the second video. Both videos are gone saying Archive.is Refused

            Good digs.

           <p>
            I have always wondered about archives and their safety in protecting info. So archive doesn't mean what I thought? Any suggestions?

             The majority of people are mirroring, not archiving. Mirrors can and will be taken down. A real archive is stored offline.
