            Oh God, they found him.  This is sick and sad at the same time.  What makes people like this?  What in the world was done to make him and the rest of the band to live and sing this way?  Now that he is gone what will they do, keep performing this perverted  What?  I can't call it music.  Some have died because they were trying to tell about horrors of trafficking and these guys are reveling in the horrors.  Who listens to this Garbage?  The world is getting sicker and sicker.  Their latest album had the word Organ in it.

             IMHO these bands brought up through Tavistock and similar programs. It's all part of the system that has been created to keep youth of each generation depressed and controlled. Much like the Grunge movement out of the Pacific Northwest, bands like Alice in Chains ( yikes on the name! ), Soundgarden, Nirvana, Stone Temple Pilots, wrote about being despondent, not fitting in and the relief brought from heroin.   All the lead singers of those bands are now dead.

              Agreed.  There seems to be horrid music now for the kids.  Nothing really uplifting.  The mid 60's was the end really.  The 60's had Love Songs, now they are Sex Songs.  Def there is something to be said on who is controlling them.  In our family none of the kids are dressing like these degenerate morons.  Combined with this music and the rapsters this is downward spiral for our kids.  An unseen epidemic of sorts. Sad.

              You are absolutely correct that grunge music has links to Tavistock-style programming. Look in the videos and concert posters, sometimes they offer clues to things the band may be selling or clandestine groups they may be a part of.

               We know this, dude.  We talked about this about a year ago.  How is it possible that so many musicians are Military Brats when only 1% of the population serve?

               Check out the biography of Rage Against the Machine in particular the lead singer, Zach de la Rocha. His father basically founded the
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Dead">
                'Day of the Dead'
               </a>
               and was connected to a contingent of alternate artists in the early 70's. 
 That art style is ubiquitous now.
