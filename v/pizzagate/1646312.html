            I wrote to TheGrimReader as well. However I have seen now looking more carefully that he basically said it was debunked in his opinion.  So I am willing to accept that.

            Look through the Skippy stuff especially.  Take note of where influence is attributed to Skippy, how people talk about him.   I think the most important ones are these three:

            The criminal background of Edgar Maddison Welch's father has never been fully proven.  For those of us there, we saw what looked like his father's arrest record, then poof, it disappeared.  If EMW's father was a convicted pedo, that's pretty strong circumstantial evidence right there that EMW is involved in this more deeply and that the CPP "shooting" was completely faked.

            it shows registered as a non profit which makes NO sense at all. The infamous Clinton clan are all listed: The company has 15 principals on record. The principals are Andrew Kessel, Bruce Lindsey, Chelsea Clinton, Cheryl Mills, Cheryl Saban, Donna Shalala, Eric Goosby, Frank Giustra, Hadeel Ibrahim, Kevin Thurm, Lisa Jackson, Ricardo Castro, Rolando Gonzalez-Bunster, Stephanie Streett, and William Clinton.

            Now that filing # does go to J&amp;T Packing but don't believe it did when first investigated. 
The state of Arkansas now shows it revoked. I would love to see or know if this was part of money laundering , transport/shipping, or planted dead end?

            Fuck off, that's retarded. They already know everything we know, their reading everything we write, the only secrets are there's, uncover them as best we can, make things harder for them to keep secrets, etc...

           <p>
            Ive got one that is about some hard evidence.  here is what happened:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             yesterday I posted an old voat link describing with screenshots and links how the CPP computer had a private or hidden section (most websites do have these, for admins) that had cached encrypted files (way more heavily encrypted than usual, like fort knox).  these files made hackers curious and have ever since.  It is claimed that these files are the child porn blackmail files kept on various politicians, including Podesta.  Back to the voat link I posted, in it the OP claimed that two podesta emails linked a meeting between him and Alefantis, on the same dates as two of the encrypted files on the CPP computer.  Get how big this is?  hard evidence.
            </li>
            <li>
             I posted this a couple of places, and unusually I had the mod Vindicator PM me saying that he had looked through the link because he was intrigued by it, and found out it had been debunked.
            </li>
            <li>
             I backtracked and edited based on the mod's word, to be responsible about it.
            </li>
            <li>
             However looking at the debunking, I found out it was done by someone with a very sketchy comment history compared to the good, evidence based comment history of the original OP.  I also read the debunking and it made no sense to me, however I am not very tech savvy.   Finally the debunking was suppported by only one other commenter, and that only in a half sort of way, not conclusive.
            </li>
            <li>
             I've noticed whenver people talk about that computer, those screenshots of files, or the possible files contained, people go nuts.  THE REDDIT BANNING OF PIZZAGATE HAPPENED WHEN THOSE FILES WERE BEING ACCESSED.  The CPP shooter supposedy shot a bullet through the closet into that computer's harddrive while on his little mission.  I've never had a mod take a personal interest in anything I've posted because it was "debunked" by sketchy debunkers a month past.   Have you?
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Here is the mod notifiying me -

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is the original thread I sent to you by OP TheGrimReader Others who I do not know but have no reason to specifically distrust say this person is a shill/wrong/etc
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1456479">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1456479
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is the "proof" of debunking-

             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1458145/7045971
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I would REALLY REALLY REALLY like to have others opinions on this debunking if you can decipher the tech part of it.  I feel there may be something important about this, it garners too much interest.  Remember TitusFrost just said 2 days ago that CPorn WAS found on that computer, and turned over to the DC police in early December, and said he was frustrated with their inaction.  Of course he was loudly yelled at and denounced all over the place.  But he did show emails between him and the police.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks for putting up this thread!  I needed a place to put this out to the community.  A lost and twisty line of inquirey indeed.  I'd like to not let it go.

             Your mention of encrypted blackmail files makes me wonder if Alefantis is keeping a dead man's switch. With all this attention on him, the elites would probably like to off him to protect their sick enterprise. And it probably wouldn't be that hard: just get a "deranged Pizzagate investigator" to murder him. So maybe Alefantis anticipated that and is saving his own skin.

              You bring up an interesting angle, and I also had this thought.  Attention lover that he is, Alefantis prob really doesn't like that there is an entire forum of people who insult him daily and discuss ad infinitum every aspect of his life.  These pushed videos definitely have taken the attention off of him and put them on Podesta.  Brock is his old friend, who definitely sends shills here.   What if they leaked that video to confuse, bewilder and set us fighting, but also to send Podesta a subtle warning (which would only work if it really WAS him) that hey, I have this stuff on you, you'd better not snitch on me, bolt, or do anything stupid.    Using the internet to intimidate him and control the narrative.    Notice Alefantis hasn't made his usual appearances saying "This video is stupid you are all stupid" etc....  (birdseyeview)  And the videos are linked to a trashy "art/snuff/shock/pedo/music" site that looks a lot like PG art.

               God damnit.  Ok so slickleg64 is probably correct.  I watched this shit go down in real time on pol.  People quickly got to the login page.  Then even faster, someone claimed to get in and find some other pw protected shit.  Then never answered.  Prob bullshit.
              </p>
              <p>
               The next few weeks there were several claims of being those original guys with no evidence.  They even floated a nonsense 2 gig torrent at some point.  It all went nowhere.  It was all just poor.
              </p>
              <p>
               On a similar note, i assumed the first part only.  It's distraction.  It's divide and conquer.  It's probably nonsense.  The second part is fair.   But the setup story is a month's old larp being repeated.

               Fuck.  They should be squirming.  Desperation and destruction is necessary and coming.  It could be the batshit phase.  Just careful with the hacking pedo sites stories.  They tend to be false.

                 There is always the possibility that one of the early larps was real and shit escalated to infinity and they went off the grid.  Fuck.  Most of those were 100% bullshit.  But the earliest ones just ended abruptly.

                 Well also, i dismissed the hard drive but they went through the trouble of shooting it.  That confused me.  I'm so tired of psyops.  I finally watched bbc Sherlock.  And by watched i mean watched everything 5 times in the last few weeks.  Deduction is difficult.

                 We'll see, Vie.  I'm extremely confident in this whole movement, but I think the next step is law enforcement, not us.  Although Trump could definitely cook up a big dramatic citizen discovery to break it wide open.  That's the opportunity of a lifetime.

            I saw something about JA being linked to a house that has been sold many times between even the same people possibly for money laundering purposes, could that have anything to do the the pizza related map that the realator found and possibly being in on what it means.
           </p>
           <p>
            If those suspected torture videos are indeed real (I can not watch them I have a 2 year old and this stuff affects me enough as it is) and was indeed put out by a sound engineer could said sound engineer have possible ties to any of the bands mentioned.
           </p>
           <p>
            Possibly nothing but might be worth a look.

             I've suspected that they have periodic parties and they move them around from place to place to reduce suspicion, ie podesta renting house in Martha's vineyard I think it was. JA owns fifteen properties, there might be enough money in these gatherings to make these properties a viable biz on that use alone with a couple parties a year. Total speculation. But with all that has going on with restaurants and politics, being a landlord doesn't seem like a good use of time, it is a place to park excess cash though

            There is alot of Golden Dawn and Masonic Theology in this stuff, reverse lookup of significant persons in any of these movements could turn something up.  Dig up different societies, organizations and their subs... Presidents organizers leaders distinguished members... see who they associate with and lets map out relationships with Known perps.
