<p>So we know that Christ Church School trustee Paul Evans runs an upmarket moving company Momentous Relocation which specialises in the fine art market. Its clients range from the main auction houses like Sothebys and Christies, to major museums, to members of the Royal family to Thatcher and to the Clintons, too.   Through its umbrella company and the affiliations of the company directors it is really part of a much wider network of logistical companies like DHL and SIVA.  Here\'s how...</p>
<p>Lawrence Edward Macgreal is one of the other directors at Momentous Relocation: <a href="https://suite.endole.co.uk/insight/people/16504849-mr-lawrence-edward-mcgreal">https://suite.endole.co.uk/insight/people/16504849-mr-lawrence-edward-mcgreal</a></p>
<p>From that list of companies I had a look at Avalon Overseas (Packing &amp; Shipping) Limited.  Even though he resigned his position there a few years ago, I noticed that the list of other directors were mostly people who are also associated with Momentous, including Evans.  
</p>
<p>One of those directors is Mr Yogesh Mehta <a href="https://suite.endole.co.uk/insight/company/01219523-avalon-overseas-packing-shipping-limited?page=people-contacts">https://suite.endole.co.uk/insight/company/01219523-avalon-overseas-packing-shipping-limited?page=people-contacts</a></p>

<p>Well, getting to some odd coincidences:</p>
<p>When I  googled SIRVA\'s address in Oak Brook Illinois, I found out that Oak Brook is also the location of the headquarters of McDonalds. Article from June 2018: <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:wrElJP6tSK8J:https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ori/ct-biz-mcdonalds-oak-brook-sale-20180713-story.html+&amp;cd=6&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ch">McDonald\'s Plaza in Oak Brook to be demolished, redeveloped under buyer\'s plan</a></p>
<p>Interestingly, the companies are only 4 minutes away from each other by car along 22nd Street  (<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/McDonald+Dr,+Oak+Brook,+IL+60523,+USA/SIRVA+Worldwide+Relocation+%26+Moving,+One+Parkview+Plaza,+Suite+400,+Oakbrook+Terrace,+IL+60181,+USA/@41.8471577,-87.9569956,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x880e4c6e5d850347:0xe2b5664f2d5fb516!2m2!1d-87.9455024!2d41.8475825!1m5!1m1!1s0x880e4e9e05cbd957:0x440aae5c5398b597!2m2!1d-87.9597659!2d41.8471689!3e0">Google map</a>)</p>
<p>And then yesterday I found out that Momentous has its warehouse based at a DHL center. Remember that\'s a company that the children mentioned?  Well, here\'s a 2015  article by Alfred Lambremont Webre – the brother of James Alefantis good friend Septime Webre, <a href="https://newsinsideout.com/2015/02/anonymous-document-exposes-hampstead-uk-school-municipality-ritual-child-sex-sacrifice-hub/">“Anonymous” document exposes Hampstead UK School &amp; Municipality as ritual child sex &amp; sacrifice hub</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Babies are supplied from all over the world. They buy them, inject and send by TNT, DHL service or the parents bring them from other parts of the world.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Voat post re DHL:  <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1486702"> DHL Child Trafficking Connections</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My father has 40+ years experience in courier, package and frieght delivery service. He was the CEO of DHL\'s Germany branch during 70s-80s. He and others began a campaign to oust Larry Hillblom (the H in DHL) after finding out he was a serial child rapist who was trafficking little boys on his private airplane, same style as Jeff Epstein. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, we had a post here about TNT just over a year ago when we were noticing a lot of warehouse fires..  <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/20903270">Logistics companies in the news alot lately - now Taylor Swift has her face on UPS trucks - Huh? Cataloguing recent accidents.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I\'ve been noticing the increased volume of &quot;accidents&quot; involving transport, distribution and logistics companies in the news lately and was beginning to chronicle them. Here\'s a post I did on the recent warehouse factory in Essex which started in the P2P Mailing Ltd unit. TNT was also located there but had moved out shortly before I believe : <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2074932">Huge fire at UK warehouse park last night, Ferndearle Child Care Services fraud case and possible MI5/6 connections. Let\'s take a look.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And of course McDonalds is mentioned in that Webre article too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>East Finchley swimming pool is amongst other meeting spots for Satanic peadophile ring. The members of the ring attend swimming sex sessions satanic ritual blood sacrifice. The ritual is permed in an upstairs room in McDonald’s on Mondays &amp; Fridays. Frank, boss of the McDonald’s (within the complex) allows the child sacrifice in the McDonald’s secret kitchen behind the mail one and is member of the cult. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was during the summer of 2014 that the children\'s interviews were recorded and the case started circulating.  One month later in September 2014, the company CAPITA were asked to do a feasibility study of the pool (along with 4 others) with a view to \'update\' the facilities. <a href="https://barnet.moderngov.co.uk/documents/s21253/Appendix%206%20-%20Feasibility%20Study.pdf">https://barnet.moderngov.co.uk/documents/s21253/Appendix%206%20-%20Feasibility%20Study.pdf</a></p>
<p>I am not sure if the pool was closed for any renovation afterwards but interestingly, Capita is mentioned here in conjunction with SERCO .. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2565714/12884835">The British pizzagate \'Hampstead case\' : shell companies and the porn industry connections</a></p>',

           And then yesterday I found out that Momentous has its warehouse based at a DHL center. Remember that's a company that the children mentioned?  Well, here's a 2015  article by Alfred Lambremont Webre – the brother of James Alefantis good friend Septime Webre,
           <a href="https://newsinsideout.com/2015/02/anonymous-document-exposes-hampstead-uk-school-municipality-ritual-child-sex-sacrifice-hub/">

          <blockquote>

            Babies are supplied from all over the world. They buy them, inject and send by TNT, DHL service or the parents bring them from other parts of the world.

          <p>
           Voat post re DHL:

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            My father has 40+ years experience in courier, package and frieght delivery service. He was the CEO of DHL's Germany branch during 70s-80s. He and others began a campaign to oust Larry Hillblom (the H in DHL) after finding out he was a serial child rapist who was trafficking little boys on his private airplane, same style as Jeff Epstein.

           And, we had a post here about TNT just over a year ago when we were noticing a lot of warehouse fires..

            I've been noticing the increased volume of "accidents" involving transport, distribution and logistics companies in the news lately and was beginning to chronicle them. Here's a post I did on the recent warehouse factory in Essex which started in the P2P Mailing Ltd unit. TNT was also located there but had moved out shortly before I believe :

           And of course McDonalds is mentioned in that Webre article too:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            East Finchley swimming pool is amongst other meeting spots for Satanic peadophile ring. The members of the ring attend swimming sex sessions satanic ritual blood sacrifice. The ritual is permed in an upstairs room in McDonald’s on Mondays &amp; Fridays. Frank, boss of the McDonald’s (within the complex) allows the child sacrifice in the McDonald’s secret kitchen behind the mail one and is member of the cult.

          </blockquote>
          <p>
           It was during the summer of 2014 that the children's interviews were recorded and the case started circulating.  One month later in September 2014, the company CAPITA were asked to do a feasibility study of the pool (along with 4 others) with a view to 'update' the facilities.
           <a href="https://barnet.moderngov.co.uk/documents/s21253/Appendix%206%20-%20Feasibility%20Study.pdf">

          </p>
          <p>
           I am not sure if the pool was closed for any renovation afterwards but interestingly, Capita is mentioned here in conjunction with SERCO ..

              I don't want to clutter up the Santa Fe post with too many Hampstead comments.  So thought I'd continue the conversation here:
             </p>
             <p>
              I found confirmation that Ella did an about turn by searching the Hoaxtead site for any comments on him.  Those idiots over there always insisted he had nothing to do with it... which meant that he did .. Lol.  I post the links below where he is mentioned and you will see by reading between the lines why she did do an about turn:

               El Coyote / 29/09/2015
You know, if we were (just say) on the run from the law and hiding out in Spain, and one of our major sources of income was the £1,000/month our girlfriend’s ex-husband was paying her in support payments, we don’t think we’d want to do anything to jeopardise that relationship.
              </p>
              <p>
               Then again, we probably wouldn’t be on the run from the law. But that’s just us.
              </p>
              <p>
               So you can imagine that Drifloud/Abe’s latest rampage against Ella Draper’s first husband, Will, came as a bit of a shock:
              </p>
              <p>
               Apparently, Drifloud has no idea which side his bread is buttered on. Not all that surprising, when you think about it.
              </p>
              <p>
               Fairly Sane  29/09/2015 at 1:32 pm Does Will Draper know Driflouds real identity? Maybe he doesn’t; maybe someone should tell him.
              </p>
              <p>
               El Coyote  29/09/2015 at 10:22 pm
That’s one purpose of this post. We’re not in contact with Mr Draper, but we hope anyone who knows him will pass this along.

               Can Abe get dole money in Spain?  30/11/2015 at 3:25 pm Belinda said Ella and Abe had little money, lived in a remote location, and had to visit an internet cafe for a connection during an interview outside the RCJ. She also claimed Ella and Abe had complained life on the run was expensive, iirc, perhaps somewhere else.
              </p>
              <p>
               Interestingly, following Ella’s recent oh-what-an-oversight-in-the-grand-scheme, ‘must do it now’ condemnation of Will Draper together with the twitter photos of him put up by Abraham (Dri floud), her change of name back to Gareeva, someone is now suggesting she has done a u-turn: This morning on coverup: ‘Will Draper was accused by Ella, but now she licks his dripping a*us.’ Maybe she realised she was shooting herself in the foot and is dependant on his stipend to pay the rent and feed Abe in Spain. There again, this particular poster, the prat, does make it up as he/she goes along, imo.

                Kristie Sue has been quoting Nathan ‘Lift the Veil’ Stolpman, which is hilarious, as he’s the one who’s stated that Ella has done a U-turn and admitted that Will Draper wasn’t in the cult! LOL!

               Spiny Norman  06/06/2017 at 2:01 am Of course, it’s all a desperate deflection tactic to avoid answering my simple yes/no question: “Kristie Sue, was Will Draper in the cult? Yes or no?” I’ve asked over and over to no avail.

              <p>
               Oh and that link she posted? It’s to a video by Nathan Stolpman, the one who reported Ella’s U-turn on Will Draper, it’s fun to watch her back herself into a corner, isn’t it. Hehe

               Very interesting. Currently doing research for several posts on my laundry list, therefore I don't know how much time I will be able to spend doing research on your list of companies, but I'll try to help.

            Love the way you think LTD3. Goes to show you've been around, you're doing your research and you aren't blindly following anyone but your own conscience. I'm glad to see someone else paying attention to Field McConnells work he makes a hell of alot of sense and these multinational corporations are the epitome of a beast with a head but no brain and the corporate power of a PERSON in law.
            <strong>

            is the head of that beast and is the metaphor that is used in the
            <strong>
             Batman
            </strong>
            movies, meaning the PRIVATIZED workers in those positions in private contracted SECURITY and EMT/AMBULANCE and medical **staff **are all SATANISTS on the DOWN LOW waiting to pop out at any moment to cause a false flag at any predetermined moment at anywhere in the world -AND - motherfuckers

            It's alot more difficult to keep up on his work now that his one website has disappeared, he's getting older, and he does most of his stuff on podcast but he really knows his shit and not enough are giving the him the credit he deserves.

            DHL and G4S are signalling that they are taking part in human sacrifice and organ harvesting through their corporate messaging. Pay close attention at the end of this DHL commercial, when the camera pans into a classroom somewhere in Africa, a lens flare moves over the heart area of a child before flying away

           <p>
            In this DHL commercial the narrator says "I am helping people live longer lives" @ 1:04 just as an adult puts a stethoscope on a third world child's heart

            Then there is this logo of a hand print with a hole in it on the side of a G4S van which I have called out as an international symbol of human sacrifice

            Capita are corrupt as fuck. They seem like the sort of company that will do the government's bidding regardless of morals.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is based on experience with Capita as the chosen company to complete PIP assessments. Despite messing up every assignment they take on and losing the government millions, they are tasked again and again by the gov to complete projects and given healthy sums to do so.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dig into Capita.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             England's Centtrip Wales Polo Team (aka Royal Polo Team), returns to Oak Brook to compete for the prestigious Butler International &amp; Prince of Wales Cup on Sunday, September 9th at 3:00 p.m. at the Prince of Wales Field. Spectators are invited to don their 'British best' as both teams face off in a 12-goal, four chukker, historic international championship match.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oak Brook Polo Club has a long history of hosting teams from other countries and is honored to have the Wales team return. The Butler International &amp; Prince of Wales Cup was inaugurated in 1986 when the England Team, captained by Prince Charles, played against Oak Brook. It was Michael Butler who invited the Prince to play, which turned into a four-day visit to Chicago and Boston. A 4-goal polo player at the time, Prince Charles would play his premier U.S. appearance with a British team at Oak Brook.
            </p>
            <p>
             Today, HRH The Prince of Wales serves as patron of the Wales Polo Team and sons Prince William and Harry have also played on the team. .. Match and International Polo Series sponsors include Merrill Lynch, Land Rover Hinsdale, Make It Better, Centtrip, New Castle, Heineken, and The Hyatt Lodge at McDonald's Campus
