<p>Dan Clark and his team may be known as “bodyguards” for well-known figures ranging from former presidents including the Bushes and Clinton, to current and former Secretary of States Hillary Rodham Clinton and James Baker, as well as Barack Obama, China’s Yang Jiechi and Omaha’s Warren Buffett.</p>
<p>But Clark’s business, Clark International not only provides executive protection services through a division of that name, but offers international investigations, its CI Guard Force for protection at events ranging from private dinner parties to public gatherings of more than 40,000 attendees, and self-defense training for youth, women and law enforcement professionals using techniques Clark and his associates developed which are now deployed throughout the world.</p>
<p>“By offering all of the facets of a successful security program under one umbrella, we are able to effectively address any aspect of security and safety in an efficient manner,” said owner Dan Clark.</p>

<p>AND (emphasis mine)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After years as a detective and investigator, <strong>Clark himself was surprised to find that even in Douglas and surrounding counties, felony crimes such as rape, theft, harassment, kidnapping, sexual predator and assault do not show up in a routine nationwide background check, even when utilizing the software and databases relied upon by the leading national background check services.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>AND</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clark also referenced his relationships with some of the top executive protection professionals in the country frequently; he networks with such teams, as well as military Special Ops personnel, Navy Seals and law enforcement to provide what he calls “seamless protection” across the country and around the globe.</p>

<p>So, we have this man, Dan Clark, and his company, Clark Industries, tied to VIPs such as the Clinton and Bush families as they travel overseas. If someone is in close proximity to someone wheeling and dealing, someone to ensure they aren\'t disturbed. He was there, in the Omaha during the Franklin Cover Up. A liaison between the local law enforcement, entities such as special ops (and I\'m willing to bet some military contractors too), and VIPs from across the world. I\'m very very curious to know how much he knows about pedogate, since he\'s in the center of a venn diagram (got bored, don\'t judge).  <a href="https://i.imgsafe.org/ccfb245547.png">https://i.imgsafe.org/ccfb245547.png</a></p>

            Some people try to discredit Ted G precisely because he was right. It's similar to ex CIA people telling us, as if they are a trusted friend, to ignore the satanism aspect of pizzagate. Ted was adamant that satanism is at the heart of the child trafficking and murder epidemic, and he is right.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interestingly, on 911 bush flew directly to Omaha after being told about the planes, underneath Offutt AFB there is a huge underground bunker where presidents are flown when the country gets attacked. Wouldn't be surprised if Buffet met him there for a laugh.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also Obama flew to Omaha to meet with Buffet last week, just before meeting with Silicon Valley people.

            I've always found Warren Buffet's story of rapid wealth creation based on buying and selling companies to be a little fishy. Could he have had inside info because he had the "right connections".
           </p>
           <p>
            Why can his performance not be duplicated?

            Absolutely good lead. Warren Buffet was involved with Franklin scandal. Owned one of the newspapers and Union Pacific Railroad.
