<p>I\'ve been trying to come up with a promotional meme (non-funny) that plays to our absolute best strengths, and I felt that our two strongest cards are people\'s child protection sentiment, and Assange\'s reputation.
Whilst the investigation should and must go on, I feel at this juncture - especially with the censorship in fuller swing than at any period of the internet\'s short history, that the primary focus of this community must be in promotion. They cant silence us all, they cant assassinate us all, and the more we get the word out the weaker they become. We have SOOOOO much smoke already, and at the end of the day, only a Court of Law can decree something as fire. So whilst the forensics remain important, education should be the focus of our energies. And besides, the FBI prolly already has 10x the evidence we have collated - they just cant act on it until/unless there is enough of a public furore to give them the cover they need</p>',
