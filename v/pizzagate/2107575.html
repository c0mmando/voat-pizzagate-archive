            Totally see what you're saying and agree. Not to be intrusive - you mentioned ECT. Did you have any symptoms that developed from that,
            <a href="https://steemit.com/news/@whitedeer9217/dissociative-identity-disorder-multiple-personality-disorder-and-temporal-lobe-epilepsy">
             like in this case? - (trigger warning)
            </a>
            Temporal lobe epilepsy seems to be an issue that comes from those practices/experiments. No pressure to respond to that.
           </p>
           <p>
            100% Agree that ritual abuse, MKULTRA type experiments and trafficking are heavily linked - I guess I just wanted to bring them up because I feel like people can sometimes forget the more icomprehensible and downright bizarre but verifiable parts of all this. Not you - but people who have not experienced all of this sometimes cannot comprehend that it really happens, and so revert to only looking into pedophile rings - which are definitely legitimate to investigate but are - as you said - part of a larger picture with all of these things happening including ritual and military intelligence abuse.

            Not to be negative, but IMHO you are conflating child trafficking and pedo abuse with ritual abuse. The two are undeniably related and intertwined, but they are also different things.
           </p>
           <p>
            Truck stop trafficking is not cult/mkultra abuse, which the elites practice and receive themselves and can take various forms. 
Pedo rings and truck stop type trafficking absolutely supplies those groups and is very very tied into it but it is not the entirety of the situation.
           </p>
           <p>
            No, not all people participate in cannibalistic cults that have mothers eat their own fetuses or cut people open and have them eat their own organs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Related, but  different very barbaric problems that all need dealing with.

            one more detail i feel like I should drop off:
that crematoriums chimney is less than 10 feet away from a small low-income apartment building. the day i took that picture there was an older looking man sitting on the porch of the apartments and he seemed very very agitated that I pulled into the crematorium parking lot at 6am on a Saturday morning. it really felt like he was standing guard.
            <a href="https://imgur.com/Hm1bqv0">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            thats the apartment building just to the right of the crematorium. why would anyone live so close to a chimney where corpses are burnt!?!
           </p>
           <p>
            another edit: i just remembered this building that is on the same block also. this is two different images of it. no windows. no signage on this building.  for some reason this building makes me think of pegasus museum.

            I'm very familiar with the story. have you seen the face that they carved into her genitals? she has shown it in a documentary.  that's what makes me feel like I certainly have stumbled upon something evil. I can literally walk from this location to RCA records HQ,  Capitol records HQ, Vanderbilt University, HCA Hq, State Capitol, Federal building... if it is really going on then it's going to be somewhere accessible to all involved without being so far out of the way that visiting would draw suspicion. I'm very tempted to do some late night urban exploring.

             Any knowledge of a tunnel system in that area? Tunnels seem to be a common denominator with trafficking. In a dense area like that, it would make it easier for them to move victims without being seen.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit: Just saw your other comment re: tunnels. Might be worthwhile to find out more. BE. CAREFUL.

              Heres a small bit of info but they imply that its for sure there. No questions about it from what this non pg article says. Pulled this directly from this link.

              "For example: the gigantic stormwater tunnel — 16 feet across — that could easily carry a canoe for a few miles (although we’re still trying to figure out if such a canoe voyage has taken place). Then there’s the 4 miles of tunnels that carry steam and chilled water to about 40 downtown buildings. And for inquiring students at Vanderbilt University: Yes, there’s a tunnel system, and it’s not even really a secret. The alumni magazine toured it, and a map diagram is available right on the Metro government website."

              Here is said map

            I don't have anything truly incriminating but, here are some pictures.
these are on the same block with the gay club( club play), straight strip club(deja vu), meat processing factory and gay teen outreach program and like 3 giant abandoned looking warehouses. Im positive there are tunnels running west from the state capital through this area to Vanderbilt university, which is also less than a mile away.

            Yes to all in my city.  Does anyone know if truckers still use CB radios to coordinate seedy trade at truck stops?  30-40 years ago hookers used to brazenly use the CB to find customers.  Or is it all done with text messages now?

            for sure. never been there and seen anyone else. Of course it's only 50 minutes to a major metropolis. There is even a rural airport frequented by politicians like speaker of house level of politicians due to the "low keyness..."

            hmmmmm I bet there are more locations like that where that came from.

            Im pretty sure something is going on in downtown Nashville on church st on the same block that the interstate entrance is on.  Around 1500 church st for anyone familiar. Bars on the 2nd floor of a medical research facility across the street from gay teen outreach center, strip club, hustler store, 2 gay clubs, crematorium, 2 walled off complexes within a block, tractor trailer parking lot, and all less than a mile from music execs, medical execs, vanderbilt university and state capitol..it is literally the interstate exit for the state capitol. I dont have solid proof. I have pics of bars om the second floor of 1500 church st...... Just putting this info in here since the topic of Tennessee has arisen

               All my friends say that; newbies moving in from LA and destroying the hippie vibe nostalgia of areas like Belmont and West End. So sad to hear. So I went to Hillsboro in the mid '80's. Go Burro's LOL!

                Your comment about L.A transplants is so true. They have turned the area around hillsboro and green hills mall into little rodeo drive and fake beverly hills. Its so ridiculous. They are putting aky sky scrapers in a block from hillsboro high now

                 Whaaa? Skyscrapers a block from Hillsboro!?!? That's awful!! So yeah, I went to Hboro and lived at Georgetown Condo's. Prolly tore those down too lol. Are we close to the same age? I'm 46. Just wondering if we may know some of the same people. Shoot, we may know each other.  Stranger things have happened. Speaking of mind control in the music biz, I dated Ronnie Milsap's son back in high school and I've often thought that if anyone's mind controlled it's Todd. Also, I have a friend from back in the day who claims that she and her brother were MK'd. Even the mother claims to believe it's true.

                   Milsap and also Katie Cook. Went to school with her too. She hosted CMT and her dad wrote the classic Coke song from the '70's.... "I'd like to teach the world to sing, in perfect harmony; I'd like to buy the world a coke and keep it company..." and another propylaea song that was sung by Don Williams called "I Believe In You." Anyways, look in to her too because my other friend found it strange that she came out in support of UFO's last year and was hospitalized shortly thereafter and went to work for Obama a little. She may be mind controlled too. I dated Todd and she dated him right after.

            Never trusted a white utility van after seeing "The Silence of the Lambs." Again, Jodie Foster in another movie about sex, young people and murder.  That little Walt Disney waif sure got around or made odd, sad choices, I guess. Or, possible Oscar choices?  I dunno.

            If this is the right Keith Jerik, then he was a maintence supervisor for the army in Colorado Springs for 20+ years.

            God Bless you and please, if you don't mind answering, do you think your handler, Brenda, was trafficked, also, or there on her own volition?
           </p>
           <p>
            You suggest asking the kids if they are alright.  I am assuming that since their handlers are there, the answer would be yes.  What would be other clues that we could look for?

               Not that I know of, but the 'beyond' kind of ties in with 'trafficking' ... to places beyond.  The swirl is sort of just there, too. It doesn't really seem to fit in with the sign.  Kind of like an add-on. But to pedophiles , it would be all they need to see.

            Unfortunately if a man even looks at a little girl they are assumed to be a pedo. Asking one if they are ok or have their parents nearby? Well, you must be up to something. That's part of why there are no male teachers.

             I totally get that. But thats your Ego talking. You shouldn't give a damn about what people think..its peoples ignorance that allows evil to thrive in the first place cause nobody wants to be somewhat responsible about "external" events. It could de-harmonize their comfort zone, their illusion. 
If you feel something very wrong is going on and you feel the energy arising from within and you speak up, no cowardly bystanders perception of you will stop you. You have no self-perception to defend anymore, you do it for something much more greater than yourself.

            This asks the question. How many truckers are "in on it" versus how many are just "paid to transport cargo and too ignorant to smell a rat". Bystander Effect is very real.

             And, have you noticed  if you are caught starring, they will give you a dirty look back? Happened to me last week, even before reading this thread now.  White utility vans just seem up to no good.  And, no, I am not paranoid. Something weird is going on, more than we realize.

            I lived in a county with one traffic light. A statewide review revealed the one rest stop in that county outside a town with 2000 people was the number one sex trafficking locale in the STATE...

             My red pilling about white vans and covert evil acts stemming from them actually came from a mystery novel series (by someone who was likely red pilled).

               My home town is a pretty normal place. I personally didn't see any white vans myself that I remember, but I do clearly remember my red pilling being catalyzed by a mystery novel series. I'd definately believe white vans are part of a nefarious agenda as a result.
              </p>
              <p>
               The novel series I'm refering too is called Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni aka Higurashi When They Cry. The author was a former social worker. Its actually a hybrid of psychological horror and hard as -redacted- mystery novel.
              </p>
              <p>
               The novels are on Steam (1st four I think) and the anime adaptation is on hulu.
              </p>
              <p>
               The white vans and the conspiracy they're a part of were foreshadowed as early as the first novel. The final novel was about blocking a false flag that would end up killing about 2000 people.
              </p>
              <p>
               The series is a masterpiece and can help red pill those who catch on to its deeper truths. Talks about a corrupt and/or incompetent CPS, covert weapons research, false flags, being suicided, bastardization of spiritual teachings, etc.

                Wow. I have to check this title out. Never had interest despite its popularity as I thought it's merely the usual anime fluff, what with the loli cutesy graphics and all. Would you recommend the manga or visual novels?

                 The anime is solid (considered one of the best animes of the 2000's) on its own merits, but is known as a bad adaptation, which speaks volumes about the source material.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The manga is a very faithful adaptation of the novels.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The cutsey graphics are all part of the bait and switch, used to terroize the viewer. Ryukishi 07 is a known troll who loves to confuse and misdirect his readers, but the series can be solved via the conventions of fair play mystery.
