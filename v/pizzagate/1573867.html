            Very strange.  His only explanation for the phrase "secret pizza" was as a "catch all" for the things he couldn't explain. Then he goes on to admit he has knowingly lied about presedential candidates.... for fun? Presumably. He also compara this completely premeditated lying on his part as the same kind of "fake news" as PIZZAGATE.   I don't know what this guys story is but it's clear by his own words that he likes to lie and likes to see how those lies will affect reality. Quite an odd way to defend yourself against real connections to real people.

            all goes back to how they use the traumatized minds of many stars as a means to drop hints,  control the narrative, cycling and empowering the archetype of ritual abuse on us all... odd and novel connections surrounding all of this. Chevy Chase  connects to Winnetka, illinois via Caddyshack which was filmed there, and Home Alone (Culkin Underground Pizza band) was filmed there. Winnetka is the home to the First ever church of Scientology. Its the wealthiest town in America. Bohemian Club members have resided there. Its also the location of a school shooting at Hubbard Woods (L.Ron Hubbard) murder suicide involving Laurie Dann (nee Wasserman) who was also taking pharmaceuticals for mental disorders (possibly associated with ritual abuse). She was the first in a long list following these types of events.

            Chevy Chase is a survivor of child abuse as well. Cycles and sickness.

            Did anyone mention Secret Pizza at the Cosmo Hotel in Vegas? Odd connection, coincidentally connecting back to Chevy Chase (Vegas Vacation/Chevy Chase village DC). The Secret Pizza Place has a secret door. No wonder why all the secrecy surrounding pizza. Next door is a coffee shop called Illumilatte with occult symbolism all over the walls.

            It seems really, really strange and beyond belief that anyone writing an article or prose of any kind would create the phrase "secret pizza" to stand for cornucopia of ideas or potpourri or mish-mash etc.  Pizza has nothing to do with random collection of anything. It isn't made of scraps.
And he claims to know almost nothing of Alefantis and could care less why he invested in expensive film making. That stretches credulity also. And isn't his theme of reality bending experiences covered in the forgettable movie, "Shutter Island"?
           </p>
           <p>
            He seems like easy pickings for criminals who need a cover story and an idiot to write press releases for them.

            OH HAI! I'm just this poor weird artist who happens to be financed by Jimmy Comet -- random! -- and yes occultism is at the center of my humble workingman's innocent art and just by happenstance I made a movie about secret pizza and then scrubbed that part from the Internet but I'm concerned and puzzled by the thing you call PizzaGate? And what's this about what you call "child trafficking"? I'm just a simple artist puzzled about reality you see and never heard of all this crazy conspiracy stuff (except where I mention I'm a conspiracy theorist). Just a simple artist puzzled by mean dangerous people, that's me!!!!!

            Not a movie production specialist here, but AFAIK producers are usually the enablers of the directors plot. Producers are like the managers, they make deals, get people involved take care of planning etc. Having a big name (movie star) as producer usually can open a lot of doors...

            I think you have brought up one of the great questions of pizzagate- why so much freaking (almost uniformly bad) ART?
           </p>
           <p>
            The aesthetic consequences - Who can possibly judge one man's demonic catharsis while commiting murder/rape as "not art"?
Are CIA mind control psychotropic weapons, created with a non artistic agenda, allowed to be judged in the realm of "music"?
Do depravity and extreme to the point of grotesque libertine acts constitute a form of art?
            <br/>
            Art now is the great cypher - the last great statement being "Art is only a commodity" made by Andy Warhol.  Ever since there is absolutely no value to art except to further money laundering, ego, daisy chains, public con games and things as yet undreamed which are themselves more imaginative than the very dull soulless stuff that the CIA, for example, passes off as a sideline - "Modern Art Was A CIA Cold War Weapon"

            This dear boy is only a struggling artist trying to convey to us what reality really is, financed by Alefantis money. How dare the crazies go after his film.

             He sounds more like someone trying to tell us what reality isn't.  Is that a valuable service?  (That's not a rhetorical question.)
            </p>
            <p>
             What I found severably revealing was his comment that Alefantis didn't seem like the human trafficking type, to Lessner.  How would Lessner know what human traffickers are like?

            Hmm.  There is a time for art and a time for action.  I'd be more impressed if this guy came out hard against pedos.  In an artistic way, of course.
