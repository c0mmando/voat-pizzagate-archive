            No, (tongue in cheek) there is no need for future research, what u unearth is incromprehensible to like 98% off all ppl i would dare guess./ in the sense that the corruption is obvious but most ppl are coincidence theorists :-D MSM &amp; other shilling surely helps to keep it that way and provides ample distraction
           </p>
           <p>
            to see the net it surely helps, but first this just part of the control grid and secondly what use is it to say what is wrong - when the
           </p>
           <p>
            easier part is (and much more important 2) to give solutions benefitting most ppl)
           </p>
           <p>
            see the template  :how to save the world
           </p>
           <p>
            To make it clear: what u research are valid topics, crossreference with ahuwahzeuses material btw, but there r much more simple ways to point out the most blatant weird parts in public media "offerings" like thruthstream vigilantcitizen et al
           </p>
           <p>
            so to get things on a better track:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Global debt cancellation between all countries, debts to non state creditors (private, corporate etc.) need to be cancelled as well. 2. 25% flat tax on consumption. That money, if spend on usefull purposes , should suffice for all infrastructure, payment of vital jobs like nurses, police (here a sidenote is warranted: military and secret services should be organized like special police forces and NOT vice versa!) etc. This solves the problem of taxation on automation and robots, too. And practically eradicates tax evasion. 3. Politicians shall openly declare income
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Please translate Blog 1 "How to save the World" (and spread into communities, where these languages are prevalent :-) to chinese, spanish, urdu, arab, russian et.al. Add this part of Blog 3 "Implementation" as P.S. : "Everybody should pick some Blog 1 related Info of his/her choosing and address in a confident, yet non obtrusive, manner, at least one other person IRL every day. The Info provided should be so compelling, that no explicit demand to spread it needs to be added. Off course this means one should pick topics one feels strongly about, and believes it will be interesting to the addressed person !"
           </p>
           <p>
            Most importantly: dont voluntarily enhance the control grid -

            There is something that we are missing and I can't yet put my finger on it because there are too many rabbit holes here once you start looking into this...  let me just drop a few links here.. and remember Findhorn in Scotland is part of this 'New Age ring'...

           <p>
            There's some stuff here that I unearthed about Sasha Lord and her connections that I haven't yet followed up on... starting with this link (you should really read the whole thing but I'll just drop some excerpts here for the sake of brevity):

            <p>
             Prince Charles visited and spoke with a murdered actress/yoga teacher/herbalist Tricia McCauley....As a yoga teacher Tricia worked with Jasmine Chehrazi, founder of Yoga Activist and the Yoga District in DC.
             <strong>
              Jasmine knew Sasha Lord and performed at Comet Ping Pong with Amanda Kleinman
             </strong>
             .. Jasmine is also connected to the Omega Institute..

             the school that took part in the event that Prince Charles attended has links to a large DC lobbying firm, Mrs Bush even gave a speech there and her daughter Jemma worked there while twin sister has connections to SPiN

              In comparison to researchers like yourself, I haven't been doing this for very long.  My angle is from the UK perspective, so the Findhorn comment was more of a reminder to myself to make the US-UK connections.  I really came to this because of the Hampstead case in the UK which has deep ties to Tavistock and I have been trying to make more people aware on this board how deeply tied the US and UK cases are (because there is more to this story that goes further afield which will come out at some point).  The Hampstead case came out a couple of years before pizzagate became a thing in the US. And if one studied the former, one would be struck by the similarities to what happened with pizzagate.  In the UK, the main online forum for discussing Hampstead was the David Icke forum.  It was clearly used as a honeypot to gather online researchers and to be used as a petri dish to study personalities and dynamics of the researchers.  That's what got me angry.  I think that case was a mixture of truth and psyops.. and I wondered at the insanity of the world that there were people that actually made a living from such sick stuff.  It was also clear to me that the UK case was a preparation for something else.  And here we are, on Voat. So, there are many questions to be asked about all of this.  The main characters of our narratives on both sides of the Atlantic are still carrying on, business as usual (almost).. is one observation.
             </p>
             <p>
              You are quite right about the size of this being difficult to fit into one post. And I am at that stage now when I find it impossible to fit all known connections into one post.  And I'm contemplating how to map things and also how to present information in a way that explains the significance of new posts.  I'll give you some examples of what I mean:
             </p>
             <p>
              In your Esalen post you provide an ARK link: ARK, TEENS AND TODDLERS, LUCIS TRUST, AND MORE

             </p>
             <p>
              That's pretty huge in the UK context:

              That's a post I did a while back about how the English education system, Tavistock and the corrupt children's services system are all interlinked.. that post includes a video... whoever did it tried to summarise all of this.. the connections are huge but one has to have an understanding of each piece of information in order to grasp how huge this is...
              <a href="https://youtu.be/RBxQpft5F_k">

             </p>
             <p>
              For instance the video opens with the title: “Eugenics within schools” ..  That means UCL, Tavistock, Wellcome Trust, Chatham House, MI6..
             </p>
             <p>
              Then it goes on to display the actual business links ...with the Laura Huxley connection...with Psychosynthesis..taking us to the Lucis Trust..C:OUI program funded by ARK..connected to the UN's Sustainability program...and here is the REAL KICKER for me (because so few people are picking up on it)...ARK is deeply connected with EXECUTION LTD. ..
             </p>
             <p>
              I wrote about that here:
              <em>
               The direct connections between the US and UK pizzagates are Tony Podesta, ARK, Execution Charitable Trust and Will Draper from the Hampstead case

              Cambridge Analytica?  That's another rabbit whole, which was covered extensively...

             <p>
              Then there are business links to Porton Down and the nuclear industry which I've written about elsewhere.. yeah.. so this is so huge it's impossible to put into one post (at the moment..) partly because there are more connections to be found...
             </p>
             <p>
              I haven't written everything yet about the Hampstead case because there are still things that I am tracking... but one thing I can mention is the occupants of an apartment that was next to Ella Draper and the children in the building that they lived in (owned by Tavistock).  That person is a therapist that belongs to group of therapists called Pegasus Evolution.. she has a very dodgy website (ahem) and travels regularly to Arab countries for Wellness lectures..she's an NLP practitioner who studied with the founder of NLP Robert Dilts.  Who else has studied with Robert Dilts?

              .. that post generated much discussion, including one of my comments:

               the Earth Charter needs to be looked into. It leads back to the UN Sustainability Agenda, the Lucis Trust and a number of dodgy characters and psyops...eg: the Hampstead case. ..PETER FERRIS (Ricky Dearman's agent) who is connected to the UN, the Tony and Cherie Blair and the Clintons  ..On his website homepage notice the link to the 'Ring of Peace' :
               <a href="http://theringofpeace.org/">
                http://theringofpeace.org/
               </a>
               .. The Ring is an annual event that we hold on the UN International Day of Peace..

             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Follow Ferris's Ring of Peace right back to the UN and his connections with the Varkey GEMS organisation... any PEACE initiatives from the UN also need scrutiny...
             </p>
             <p>
              A similar technique of plausible deniabilty and deflection is used with Raniere's Global Technologies :
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3179905">
               Digging deeper into Keith Raniere's "Global Technologies Inc" reveals truly global links and maybe, government agencies connections. This needs more eyes...
              </a>
              According to the narrative, Raniere tried to claim that a patent belonging to two government scientists belonged to him when it didn't.. Raniere was working WITH those men and continued to do so after the court case:
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3179905/18232983">
               https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3179905/18232983
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              The whole NXIVM thing is tied up with the military, the nuclear industry and the US Government but the media narrative is that this NXIVM cult is about this ego maniac Raniere.. classic bait and switch...  just as it happened with the Hampstead case and  the sulphur trail  that Will Draper leaves right back to the UK government, British intelligence services and Oxbridge, Execution Ltd., ARK, etc. is covered up and ignored.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, looking at how the whole Global Technologies thing was managed where unrelated people set up subsidiary businesses to look unrelated led me to an Epstein business that is based around  yachting. At some point I'll post about that because that's a whole other rabbit hole that hasn't yet been tackled.
             </p>
             <p>
              Another link that is ignored is Mark Epstein, brother of Jeffrey Epstein.  He is a director of the UN's Humpty Dumpty institute.. they are involved with landmine issues.. you know, the issue that Princess Diana was involved with?  Links back to the Fayad family and current stories being played out in Mayfair, Dover Street … Trump in the UK..Imran Khan, Hasnat Khan- heart surgeon and Princess Diana's lover

              (notice how most of these posts eventually link back to one or more members of the Royal Family?  And which US President has only this week been hosted by, wined and dined by the Royal Family in a huge PR exercise that was wall-to-wall media coverage in the British press?)
             </p>
             <p>
              Is there any point in me posting about this?  Not really, the post would get half a dozen upvoats and a few more views while a CDAN post about Kanye being MKUltra'd, for example will get a factor times 100 views.. because that's the real level of this forum..
             </p>
             <p>
              So, I applaud your efforts.. I'm beginning to get tired of this whole thing because I don't see real change.. I see consolidation of power and the continuing of the globalisation agenda while people are blinded by their political affiliations and that is being used against them – very successfully.

               Thank you! I totally understand your frustration when talking about seeing good information mixed with disinformation, it is a serious problem. Do you have other posts on that subject I can look into? I'd like to read your work. Also: your comment has so much new &amp; additional information, it deserves its own post. Was absolutely shocked at that "Our Children Our Investment" video on ARK/Lucis Trust etc etc, I somehow managed to identify the same points in my research and yet had not seen that video, ever! Highly impressed that it was done so many years ago, and the video includes more specific information regarding locations in the UK, for example, that I didn't have access to. Gad that I wasn't the only one to see the existence of that ring.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also on your point here: "So, I applaud your efforts.. I'm beginning to get tired of this whole thing because I don't see real change.. I see consolidation of power and the continuing of the globalisation agenda while people are blinded by their political affiliations and that is being used against them – very successfully."
              </p>
              <p>
               I applaud your efforts too, you have obviously done some intense work on this. The point may not be to reach a massive audience, (I know my steemit post will not reach more than a couple hundred pairs of eyes at maximum, no matter how much time I spent on it] but at the most basic minimum level it is worth it to me to continue so that if any survivor from these rings (like RA anon) search for information validating what happened to them, they will be able to a) find something and b) know that they are not crazy or alone. From what I understand, that kind of validation can mean everything to survivors.

                But keep spreading your "Babylonian pedovore" thing, that should be a lot more redpilling and practical.  We wouldn't wanna expel the Jews, that has

            They burnt the evidence with DEWs and are rebuilding currently. If anyone is able to get photos and look for symbols, that'd be great.

             I've heard from someone that her parents visit a nude camp. She said that she would never do that, yet people go these with underage children.

             Agreed. Hence so much writing and research has gone into looking up these places, by myself and others. I can't link everything here, but I threw together an

              index
             </a>
             of posts on the Centers Gathering and etc, as related to the initial testimony of RA Anon... which I have to say keeps getting corroborated over time the more research is done.

             Also noteworthy: Harbin is located relatively close to Napa Valley, which is it's own hotbed of ritual abuse, there is a Rothschild-owned winery there, etc. And Harbin itself is on thousands of acres of land -- I would assume that land is worth multiple millions of dollars - how did a 501c commune made up of hippies get that much cash!?
