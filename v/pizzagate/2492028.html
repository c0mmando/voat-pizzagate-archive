             founded a data brokerage (ABI/InfoUSA/InfoGroup.)  These big payment and big data processors are highly suspicious in their connections and locations even.  The biggest data broker for citizens' information I believe is Axciom out of Little Rock who are connected to the Clintons.

              you are a great researcher and thank you for leading me to First Data.  I am probably one of the only people for whom they would raise a red flag because I came across them a year ago while researching for two threads I did on Big Data.  But it never occurred to me to look into them then

              Wow.  I just got a  403  access denied and the goat asked me What did you do?  Um.  Anyway.  Aerospace and Defense and AI and a co. connected to McLean I think spells enough to research this, imo.  We need Techies on this.

               Yeah, it took me a few months to even post this. All this time I thought the stalker was Greg Chism or Doyle Mills it might have been my ex and he works for them, so I was really scared to even post this after the Facebook page that came sending me messages a few months ago with the dead body in a pool of blood on it. I assume that the CEO guy who worked under Obama's economic recovery is important, it says on my older post that he was in the military and is a lawyer, etc.

                Good God.  Those other two are scary enough.  I will never forget researching Mills.  He is surely still flying back and forth from Tampa to Texas with children.  But pools of blood is frightening.  How horrid that you would expect your ex behind this.  CEO  possibly?

                 Also, just as an aside, I was looking for some old files on a flash drive when I saw a thing from my ex's notes from grad school that mentioned an Eric Braverman. I don't know if it was the same Eric Braverman as the one from CF but it said that they charge $7000 for each employment selection test, which certainly seemed like someone would have to have been tremendously over charging the client.

                  Hah.  That is a dead giveaway that it is the CF.  Most def I think there is a strong possibility it is the same EB.

                </p>
                <p>
                 Reporting from Washington — President Obama's decision to tap General Electric Co. Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt to lead an initiative on jobs and U.S. competitiveness highlights two key White House focuses: Obama wants to convince corporate America that his administration is not anti-business, and he wants to show average citizens that the economy is no longer on life support.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Immelt will replace former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker as head of a reconstructed White House panel of business, labor and academic leaders that has offered periodic economic advice to Obama since early in his presidency.
                </p>
                <p>
                 on my other post

                  https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2436702

                 I talk about Volcker. The current CEO of Infor worked on that same advisory board under Volcker. So no surprise there that they would be partners now.

                  Partners in crime is what they are.  Volcker and Immelt together surely spell disaster.  They are constantly rewarded for their accomplishments.  Up the ladder they move.

Bravo!
Yeah, the dead body photo was so disturbing that I don't even want to reshare the link to it. I will spare everyone the details. It either has to be him, or it has to be someone who wanted me to think it was pedos, but was doing it for him. One of the things I was sent last fall included his handwriting. I was in some major denial about that but things have started to add up.

                   I don't think that there will ever be "proof," but I don't need it because I know his handwriting. The main problem is that the cops won't do anything to him nor will the FBI, so I have to live with the stalking from him and god knows how many of his friends. Amazingly it goes in cycles and seems to target me whenever I am doing something important. So as long as I find ways to protect myself I will be ok I hope.

                    Well, I hope it is just jealousy of some sort and not some psycho stalking.  The fact that LE does not act though, is very disconcerting.
