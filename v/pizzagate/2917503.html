<p>Key passages:</p>
<p>The main premise is custom-made to be relatable to teenagers. It is about a 16-year-old girl who goes to high school, loves her boyfriend, and goes out with her friends. But, also, she’s a witch and her family members are proud satanists. Throughout her infernal adventures, lots of disturbing things happen and lots of messages are delivered. Here are some of the themes exploited by the series.
Selling Satanism</p>
<p>In every episode of the series, the main “selling points” of Satanism are interwoven in the plot and presented in a way that is relatable to teenagers. Sabrina’s two aunts and cousin are staunch witches who yell out “praise Satan” whenever something good happens. However, they are not pointy-nosed harpies riding around on brooms, but likable, intelligent women who act as caring mothers to Sabrina. In fact, all witches in the series are witty, charismatic, good-looking people that are open-minded and tolerant of all lifestyles.</p>
<p>Sexualizing Minors</p>
<p>At the moment of her dark baptism, Sabrina is still technically 15 years old. Despite this fact, the series clearly implies that her baptism involves her copulating with Satan.
The Sick, Twisted Messages in &quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot;</p>
<p>Prior to her dark baptism, Sabrina wears a white wedding dress.</p>
<p>White wedding dresses represent the purity of the bride and Sabrina’s virginity was deemed extremely important prior to the baptism. When she confirmed that she was still “untouched” prior to her dark baptism, her aunt replies: “Praise Satan!”. Sabrin</p>
<p>The series also normalizes another obsession of the occult elite: Cannibalism.
Normalizing Cannibalism</p>
<p>In past articles on The Vigilant Citizen, I noted that cannibalism is, for some sick crazy reason, being promoted in mass media. Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is playing its part. Big time.</p>
<p>In the first episode, Sabrina’s aunts (who run a mortuary) receive the body of a boy who was stabbed to death. Upon looking at the cadaver, aunt Zelda sighs:</p>
<pre><code>“It’s a shame they wanted an open casket—we haven’t had long pig in ages.”
</code></pre>

<p>The expression “long pig” is used by psychopaths to describe human flesh as food. Therefore, Zelda wanted to eat a young boy who recently was murdered. That’s great entertainment for our youth.</p>
<p>In a later episode, Zelda dreams about receiving Satan for dinner. She prepares him his favorite dish: Roasted child.</p>',

            I tried to watch this under the protection of the lord, just to see how far it went. I couldn’t get through the credits. It’s so strange to see Satan flaunting so openly. Really wonder how well it’s working on the youth.

            Satanism.is.just the debt system...
No mystery to it...the ones selling it as a mystery are the ones who bemefit the most from the debt system..and want to divert u away from understanding its simplicity ..
This is why they hate Christ...
....he simplified the accounting system...that will take just one dollar to undo their power..
If people catch onto this simplicity if using ur dollars and assrts to reduce debt ...
Their game is over..until then we feed it via loaning to banks ..and increasing the debt system..its not really debt ..its a failure to pay...and our energies and credits are surety to this failure to pay system..
Its an insurance scam that we decide to be the insurer to ...
           </p>
           <p>
            Dont believe me ..email the debt reduction department if the US treasury...
           </p>
           <p>
            Turn of the power on them...
