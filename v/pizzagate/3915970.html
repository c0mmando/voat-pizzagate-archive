              Are you kidding me???
             </p>
             <p>
              The guy thinks he can fool the public by lying about the obvious.
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>
               He doesn't sweat, in spite of pics of him sweating
              </li>
              <li>
               He denies that was him in the pic with Virginia, although we can all see it was
              </li>
              <li>
               He thinks we can't timeline his visits with Epstein to show he was still in touch after 1st conviction.
              </li>
              <li>
               Etc.
              </li>
             </ul>
             <p>
              His instinct when cornered is to try to lie his way out of it.
             </p>
             <p>
              He has no real ability to think things through. He has the lazy mind of a rich pampered pussy.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't see how anyone could feel confident following his management in a criminal enterprise. He doesn't have the skill set required.

                 when news came out that  Prince Andrew was seen at the apartment in New York  and that one of the girls was going to the news naming Prince Andrew  instead ignoring the accusation like most of those who have been accused  the prince lied in a way that was easily provable and has ignored all competent council on how to stay out of the media cross hairs..  at this pointb I hear everyone saying he is to dumb to of been a intelligence operator....that's how some one involved in intelligence work  would want to be seen.

             unfortunately this is just an idea....no real articles written to support the idea .  I posted  it in QRV witch is probably more appropriate seeing how you want info not speculation

              To assist with your submission staying here, one thing you can provide linked support for (preferably with timestamps), would be relevant youtube links relating to:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Shawn Atwood runs a true crime podcast and a YouTube channel that has pushed the narrative of the prince being an idiot caught in a honeytrap that was baited by Maxwell and Epstein...

            lets try looking at this as if are view of this has all ready been messed with by intelligence operations....I truly wonder if Shawn Atwood's YouTube channel is a MI 6 operation.

             I think Atwood is. And if you go through the links I gave you on the other subverse you will find material to add to your post to satisfy the rules.

              Interesting. I’ve wondered about him too. He was caught in the US with a massive drugs operation and spent small jail time compared to others. His channel is pretty big but he never seems to get demoted and has access to all the people on the subjects. He is a good journalist and does get relevant info out there but there is something unknown and not sure what that is exactly...
