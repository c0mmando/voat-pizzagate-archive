<p>I will give Purple magazine it\'s own entry, as I did with Dazed Magazine in part 1. Rachel Chandler has worked for both magazines and as I looked through their website it was like a who\'s who of this series. Our subject today has featured in the magazine frequently and is signed by  Next Models. They have been named in a class action lawsuit for mistreating models, along with Jean Luc Brunel\'s MC2 models: <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5963117/Models-file-suit-against-Wilhelmina-Major-Elite-MC2-Models-Click-agencies.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5963117/Models-file-suit-against-Wilhelmina-Major-Elite-MC2-Models-Click-agencies.html</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.ibb.co/5KjjjB8/oo10.png">https://i.ibb.co/5KjjjB8/oo10.png</a> - Now... this is a painting she says she found in a flea market. The faces depicted are clearly underage but they are painted nude. It is doubtful that these bodys are proportionate to the age that these girls seem but for me this is quite disturbing and very borderline when it comes to legality. I certainly would never put this up in my house and I would question anyone who thinks it is appropriate decoration.</p>

<p>At first when I was doing this research it seemed a bit endless. The more connections that came up the more I had to research. At this point I have a feeling that a clearer picture is starting to emerge. The people and magazines that seem involved is starting to narrow down. There is still much work ahead and I will try to keep these coming. Again, thanks for reading. If you have something to add to this research or thoughts it is much appreciated. Of course I also must state that I don\'t condone harassment of the people in these articles.</p>

           - Now... this is a painting she says she found in a flea market. The faces depicted are clearly underage but they are painted nude. It is doubtful that these bodys are proportionate to the age that these girls seem but for me this is quite disturbing and very borderline when it comes to legality. I certainly would never put this up in my house and I would question anyone who thinks it is appropriate decoration.

           - "Jane is reminiscing about watching horror movies with her dad as a little girl" It's not surprising she had a messed up upbringing. Starting to wonder who her dad is.

           At first when I was doing this research it seemed a bit endless. The more connections that came up the more I had to research. At this point I have a feeling that a clearer picture is starting to emerge. The people and magazines that seem involved is starting to narrow down. There is still much work ahead and I will try to keep these coming. Again, thanks for reading. If you have something to add to this research or thoughts it is much appreciated. Of course I also must state that I don't condone harassment of the people in these articles.
