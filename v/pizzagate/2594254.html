<p>Clinton Foundation Implicated In Child Sex Investigation In China</p>
<p>A Chinese kindergarten run by a senior member of the Clinton Foundation is under investigation after claims of child sex abuse and needle marks on children. 
Parents say their children were stripped naked, given unknown “white pills” and “brown syrup” and sexually abused while in the care of the kindergarten in Beijing’s eastern suburb of Guanzhuang.
The kindergarten is run by RYB Education Institution, which is currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange. One of the board members of this company, Joel Getz, also served as a Director of Development for the Clinton Foundation in New York, with a primary focus on Haiti.</p>
<p>SUPER PREDATORS
Several parents found needle marks on her children’s bodies, Caixin media group, said on Thursday.
Medical examination of eight children confirmed that the injuries were indeed caused by needles, Guanzhuang police later said.
According to RT, apart from needles, children were given “white tablets and a brown syrup,” a group of parents who staged a protest outside the nursery, told Caixin, adding that they had no idea what these substances were. “Disobedient students were also forced to stand naked or were locked up in a dark room at the kindergarten,” one parent said.</p>
<p>One father claimed that “his child said had taken two white pills after lunch, and slept after eating the pills,” CCTV reported.
Chinese media reported saying that there were incidents when a naked adult male conducted “medical check-ups” on unclothed children. “If there is no explanation, I’m not sending my child here anymore. I will come over every day until they respond,” a father, named Li, told AP.</p>
<p>According to the South China Morning Post, the kindergarten where the scandal broke has tuition fees of about 5,000 yuan (US$750) a month, which is “about half of the average monthly salary in the city.”
Later on Thursday Chinese media cited a local education official who said that at least three teachers at the nursery had been suspended. Police have already launched a probe into alleged child abuse and obtained security footage for the investigation. “Recent child abuse cases in kindergartens have greatly harmed the victims and their families and brought serious consequences. They exposed problems in the management of kindergartens,” the Chinese Education Ministry said later on Friday, as cited by Xinhua.
RYB apologized “for the serious anxiety …….” in a statement on its website.</p>
<p>The kindergarten was located near a  large military base, rumors that military officials are involved---no evidence but rumors.</p>
<p>Beijing-based RYB Education was founded in 1998 and made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in September this year.
This is not the first case of sexual abuse to have allegedly happened in RIB Education facilities. In 2015, two teachers were found guilty of physically abusing children at one of its kindergartens in the city of Siping in eastern China.</p>
<p>RYB Education operates 80 kindergartens and has another franchised locations  in China. All of it’s directors are all Chinese, with the exception of former Clinton Foundation executive and associate dean at Yale, Joel Getz, who is listed as an Independent Director.</p>

            I have heard about this before, but the shill is right, YourNewsWire is fake news that tries to get us to run with it to make us look bad. It's like using Snopes to "debunk" something. It's a no go.

            Sadly, I remember when this story broke and I mentioned it to my family. They did not believe me. They watch the news everyday and called me paranoid and mocked me for believing fake news. This story made me especially sick after visiting China and working with kids there. Thanks for posting it again, I didn't know about the Clinton connection, would like to learn more.

            The Beijing kindergarten at the heart of the controversy is located next to a large military base, sparking rumors that military officials had been sexually abusing the children. Notably, the husband of the kindergarten’s director was previously an official at the base, however Fun Junfeng, the base’s political commissioner told PLA daily that there was “no evidence” that military personnel are involved in the abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            These latest allegations are not the first involving RYB schools. In April, the head of a different RYB kindergarten in Beijing was suspended after admitting that teachers had made “severe mistakes” when videos emerged of children being thrown and kicked in the back. In October, 2016 two teachers from an RYB kindergarten in the northeast Julin province were sentenced to 34 months in prison after jabbing children in the buttocks, head, and insides of their mouths with sewing needles.
           </p>
           <p>
            This sounds Beyond Horrible.  Military.  Grown men coming at little children. Horrid.

            Hi fogdryer, can you edit this thread to provide more reliable sources for this? YourNewsWire is a disinfo site.

            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2260071">
             did a post
            </a>
            on this seven months ago that has multiple more reliable sources in it you could cite. You also might want to compare their version of the story with the other sources' and take out anything that hasn't been corroborated elsewhere. They are fake news designed to target conservatives and make them look stupid.
           </p>

            Also, here's the search results for all of the articles posted here on this:

              Perhaps because you are viewing on mobile? Try "view desktop site" in your browser settings. Also, sometimes you have to turn your phone or tablet...autorotate sometimes hides the buttons.

            ProTip Fogdryer, you can turn this:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Clinton Foundation Implicated In Child Sex Investigation In China
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Into this:
           </p>
           <h1>
            Clinton Foundation Implicated In Child Sex Investigation In China
           </h1>
           <p>
            By adding a "#" with no space after it in front of "Clinton".  :-)  If you add two in a row it looks like this:
           </p>
           <h2>
            Clinton Foundation Implicated In Child Sex Investigation In China
           </h2>
           <p>
