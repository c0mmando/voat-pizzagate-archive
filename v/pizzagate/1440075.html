            IF you can fine ANYTHING besides obtuse connections to bars in Oregon that Hillary had a drink at, or ping pong businesses in California with "threatening" shadows of the photographer, and IF you can REASONABLE but SPECIFICALLY explain how the connection ties DIRECTLY to the #pizzagate investigations, it is most worth finding and sharing, and getting the information out to the public eye.
           </p>
           <p>
            But to go off on tangents trying to tie in stupid YouTube conspiracy vids SIMPLY because they mention Satanism, or weird articles and Facebook pages involving alleged pedophiles who are NOT directly tied to this investigation, you are on your own. Go forth and multiply, and dig away. Just PLEASE do not try to clutter up THIS subverse with such tin-foil hat "investigative journalism." Take it over to

            , or expect to find it removed, and then have to click the "REMOVED SUBMISSIONS" link at the bottom of the sidebar on the right.
           </p>
           <p>
            Time and place. This is neither for ANYTHING on the outer fringes of reasonable investigation SPECIFIC to #pizzagate. PLEASE DO go and FIND stuff. No one is stopping you or saying you shouldn't. Just don't post it here unless it follows the rules as posted. Should be simple enough to understand...

            No, your whiny little post STILL exists, snowflake. Click the "REMOVED SUBMISSIONS" link on the RH toolbar at the bottom.
Your POS submission had NO business within this subverse, because it is nothing more than a whiny rant about how YOU don't like the way the subverse is being run. Get over yourself. This subverse is not here to cater to the special snowflakes, nor the whiny fucktards who KNOW how things are supposed to run.
           </p>
           <p>
            This subverse has a focus and a purpose, which is to investigate the #pizzagate situation. Nothing more, nothing less. ANYTHING that detracts or derails the attention from the topic, ESPECIALLY whiny little diatribes that bitch about non-related shit being removed, have NO business here. It is irrelevant to the topic, in spite of your butthurt.
           </p>
           <p>
            Go click the REMOVED SUBMISSIONS button. There you can find every stupid, inane, and unrelated thing that has been removed. It will keep you busy and off the streets for awhile. You don't seem to have anything of value to contribute to the investigation other than bitching about how the subverse is staying on topic, so what do you have to lose???

            Nope, not even close, binky.
           </p>
           <p>
            The focus of #pizzagate, is the alleged pedophilia ring operating out of WASHINGTON DC, (not bars in Oregon, or ping pong parlors in California), and it's DIRECT connection to some of the biggest names in politics, mainly focusing on connections to the Clinton Foundation, and its relation to the Clintons, as regards alleged pedophile ring cover ups, collusion, complicity, and involvement.
           </p>
           <p>
            The alleged pedophile ring appears to be connected in a myriad of ways to several businesses in the surrounding DC area, many of which have a preponderance of pizza-related references and connections to a select group of powerful people. Comet Ping Pong appears to play a major role in the interactions between alleged pedophilia activities and powerful political people in the area.
           </p>
           <p>
            The focus is NOT on "pedophiles." They are a dime a dozen, and exist world-wide.
The focus is on a SPECIFIC group of alleged pedophiles, operating from a SPECIFIC locale, with SPECIFIC incidents involving a pizza shop run by a guy who was voted the "49th Most Influential Person" in DC.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope this has helped clarify the somewhat narrow and SPECIFIC focus of #pizzagate for you.

            Not in the least. I am doing my damnedest to help direct that flow of information, by pointing out that EVERY pizza reference is NOT necessarily related to #pizzagate or pedophilia.

            will continue to compile, collate, and investigate the SPECIFIC information relating to the situation, and not miss the side bullshit one bit. Side bullshit dilutes the validity of what is going on, and obfuscates actual facts and evidence by sidetracking investigations. Let the side bullshit go to

            Actually, none whatsoever. BUT, I am focused and committed to "the cause," so collateral damage does not affect me.

            Those unable or unwilling to follow the SIMPLE rules as CLEARLY stated on the sidebar have no business here. This subverse will not miss them, as NONE of us (especially me) is crucial to the situation, or getting the truth out there.
           </p>
           <p>
            This means that all the bullshit needs to be swept from the stables. If the people who are the source of the bullshit are unhappy, oh well. The people who truly want the truth, without the extra sides of bullshit can better navigate this morass of #pizzagate, free of off-the-wall YouTube vids, Reddit whining, and "interesting" articles that have nothing SPECIFICALLY RELATING TO #pizzagate, will hopefully find #pizzagate less cluttered and confusing. Then this subverse will have accomplished what it set out to do.
           </p>
           <p>
            A group of the malcontents have now started

             /v/pizzagateunedited
            </a>
            . Now all the irrelevant and unrelated bullshit has a home, and everyone who wants absolutely every possible bit of information about pedophilia that can however loosely be connected to #pizzagate can go THERE to theorize, consider, and generally circlejerk their concerns. Best of success to them, may they thoroughly enjoy themselves. And I do sincerely mean that.

            Then go start a subverse condemning it. If you whiners would direct your energies into FOLLOWING THE SIMPLE FUCKING RULES, instead of complaining how rule breakers are being removed from the discussion, SO much more would be getting done. But, misdirection is a tool to try to discredit the movement, isn't it??? If you are not part of the solution, you are part of the problem. TAKE YOUR SNOWFLAKE COMPLAINING somewhere else! Worry, and go tell all the sites telling people about VOAT your worries. We know, we've heard you all fucking day. And guess what? We don't care. VERY few are siding with you whiners. Your irrelevant and unrelated stuff is STILL on VOAT. Go read it, and stop your complaining already. SO much worry. But NO action. Just whining. GO if you don't like it. START your OWN subverse if you don't like this one. But STOP TRYING TO TAKE CONTROL. This is NOT your space, and no matter HOW hard you scream about it, or worry about it, or complain about it, it is NOT going to BE your space. YOU can be PART of THIS space, but it will NEVER be YOURS. How truly fucking stupid ARE you people that you cannot accept this? How MANY times will you "threaten" to leave, yet NOT do so? Take your worries, and your bitching, and leave already! And be sure to comment on every article on the web how you were SO mistreated here...

           </p>
           <p>
            AIPAC owns washington DC, AIPAC owns all the polticians mentioned in #PizzaGate, funny how AIPAC can't be discussed on VOAT
           </p>
           <p>
            AIPAC has compromised all USA politicians with sexual ( child fucking ) since they killed JFK in 1963. Fact.

           <p>
            Thus you cannot discuss #PizzaGate ( child molesting ) without talking about the enablers, AIPAC.

            Oh come on, on the front page now there are two completely fake and previously debunked stories taking up room. Merely blocking links already posted would stop that. Until some thing like flair for fake shit or link blocking for fake already debunked shit is implemented, something needs to be done. "Let votes decide" yes..and fake poster brings pals in to UV. Fake is fake. Deleting someone's thoughts on fake shit hurts their feelings? WTF we go all snowflake on this? Real stuff is being pushed to the back.

            Proof you are a former mod? Why didn't you message him and express your concern? Why take the question public? What post is it exactly you had a problem with that he deleted? You haven't provided any answers to any of these questions. This post looks like it meant to bait stupid side arguments and generally just lower this subs morale.

             and they should not fuck with US. We ALL follow the SAME rules. No special treatment. But the snowflakes cry because they are unique and special. MEH. GTFO if you can't play nice with others. The rules apply to ALL, and not ONE of us is so important as to be exempt from the rules. STAY FOCUSED. Go post your weird ass, unrelated, obtuse pseudo-religious crap ELSEWHERE, UNLESS it is SPECIFICALLY related to #pizzagate. If it is, SAY WHY, and most likely, it will remain here. I don't care who you are or were here, or on Reddit, or anywhere else. YOU are just another one of US. Either get with the program or leave. The intelligent people will fight the good fight with or without you. YOU make the call.

             well its a pretty common tactic on reddit, that when a mod fancies itself the ruler of its tiny, insignificant little bit of power over other people that private messages to the mod team are as useful as tits on a pig.
            </p>
            <p>
             the fact that you came from reddit demonstrates two likely scenarios: A) your just smart enough to realize that reddit is a sinking ship but your too fucking stupid to not repeat those mistakes, or B) your actively working against the investigation.

              Excuse me for questioning a dissenting post with no substantiated information, I must be working against the sub. Either that or I'm "fucking stupid" because I'm from Reddit. If you know that, you must of looked through my post history long enough to scroll to the bottom. Why don't you look at what I've contributed and make that assertion yourself before questioning my integrity as a member here. I came here to help and encourage discussion, I try to speak out against posts that trigger my bullshit sensor. Most posts pointing fingers with no evidence are bullshit, and I don't think people should take the OP at his word.

            I created a post with my suggestions on how to organize this topic. The problem with it is that it involves a wide range of things that play into the entirety of it. One of the ways all this was discovered was "spirit cooking" references, which led to pedophilia, which led to gov corruption, which led to financing and legal protections, which led to a massive conspiracy that it is easy to classify as HISTORY OF THE WORLD !!! They have been doing this a long time. We very much need to thresh it all out to deal with it. We can't drain the swamp if we don't know the monsters who run the damn thing.

            This is a good opportunity to capture the narrative and to expose the Jewish hand behind these pedophile rings. We need to show people how Satanism is basically a wing of Judaism and how Jewish Blood Libel is part of Talmudic doctrine. The Talmud is Judaism, it's what Rabbis study.

             This is not solely a jewish issue. LOL bias is strong in this one. Mormons have blood atonement and they still do it. And most people know what the Talmud is. And FYI there is no "afterlife" in Judaism, and no satan...cause if there's no afterlife...well figure it out. Gnostic doctrine included reincarnation...

              Jews do believe in Satan, but it's The Satan, like a job title and it means hinderer. So in Judaism the Satan works for God, his job is to hinder and to test so that only the worthy pass. So yes they believe in angels, what they don't believe is that any of the angels could actually rebel against God.

             To single out one religion as a culprit is not scientific. I read some things about this subject when it was posted, and my conclusion was that it is based on rumor and ignorance. Religion has warped all of our thinking. We could make the same argument about christianity, that the "sacrifice" of the "blood and wine" is satanic. It is likely this reason that so many christians were killed way back when -- people thought they were really killing children and eating flesh and drinking blood. And hey -- since I wasn't there -- the possibility exists THAT THEY WERE !!!  --- The problem happens when you GENERALIZE and give the impression that ALL people who are jews are the same. They ain't, so don't say it.

             The site rules trump the sub rules dick. Which are "FREE SPEECH" but no spam and must be on topic (a weird post isn't OFF topic if it's addressing the topic). This isn't reddit you faggot. And this is also why I have requested to take over this sub and install voat moderators that will not censor things outside of spam and completely irrelevant posts.

             This subverse is compromised. We just had a huge influx of new mods right after people started complaining about " antisemitism" and how " antisemitic" users should be banned and now all of a sudden all the submissions that reference Judaism are being deleted by the new mods.

              Lovely. Consider everyone informed. NOW, what does all this "compromising" have to do with #pizzagate? Other than crying about mods and how stupid posts that contribute nothing but "the joos are behind it ALL!" are being (rightfully) deleted, HOW are you ADDING to the discussion? And by ADDING, I mean providing INFORMATION to help prove the #pizzagate is not a fantasy? If you can't do that, STFU now.

               The reason for the recent influx of many new people to Voat from Eddit is due to the censorship and ultimate closing of
               <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
                /r/pizzagate
               </a>
               , as well as fallout from the shadoweditgateapocalypse. To come here and immediately witness censorship in
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                /v/pizzagate
               </a>
               is a very unwelcome sight indeed.
              </p>
              <p>
               OP is astutely correct in stating that the built-in system of upvotes/downvotes is meant to avoid the need for heavy-handed moderator involvement and deletion of posts/comments.
              </p>
              <p>
               Censorship is a BIG issue for alot of people right now, so I also appreciate if people point out when they believe the integrity of something to be comprimised. I won't automatically believe this assertion, but I appreciate it being brought to my attention so I can further investigate for myself.
              </p>
              <p>
               This also heightens community scrutiny and awareness should any new evidence of shady practices come to light. It is vitally important to remain steadfastly vigilant of those with even a modicum of power.

                I think people are confusing the issue here which is #pizzagate, with the underlying unhappiness with Reddit.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also, the censorship and ultimate deletion of #pizzagate at Reddit was done allegedly over the publishing of "personal information," while the censorship/deletion of posts here at VOAT are more related to off-topic and unrelated information. Additionally, Reddit never offered access to deleted posts, UNLIKE HERE, where anyone who want to can click the "Removed Submissions" and/or the "Removed Comments" links on the RH sidebar, and SEE what was removed. This information has NOT been shitcanned into oblivion, so much as it has been removed from where it did not belong.  So, TECHNICALLY, what many are decrying as "CENSORSHIP," really isn't. It is like when forum posts are in the wrong sub forum, and so are moved out of said wrong subforum.  They are NOT deleted, just removed from where they do not belong.
               </p>
               <p>
                All the caterwauling of this subverse being compromised is blowing smoke up your ass, and expecting you to think your shit is on fire. The rules for submission are CLEARLY posted, nothing secret, nothing untowards, and nothing extraordinarily repressive. STAY ON TOPIC. Basically that is the #1 main rule. If what you are posting HERE is NOT SPECIFICALLY related to #pizzagate, and again, the key word is SPECIFICALLY, it gets removed to the pile of "removed submissions" or "removed comments." Again, nothing sinister, nothing hidden. It is what it is, and it is CLEARLY spelled out for ALL to read and heed.
               </p>
               <p>
                The people whining the loudest about this, and screaming for removal of the mods, and telling OTHERS to leave the subverse, while THEY remain to whine some more, are the people who simply REFUSE to play by the ESTABLISHED rules.
               </p>
               <p>
                I don't know who gave the impression that #pizzagate here on VOAT was some free-form, anything goes, post any shit you like, free for all. But it's not. Again, CLEARLY printed on the side bar is the purpose of this subverse:
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 This subverse is for the investigation of and dissemination of information related to #pizzagate.
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                Key Word: "RELATED." Not weird off the wall ramblings about the Talmud. Not vague and rambling "maybe," or "possibly," or unverifiable rumors or innuendo. SPECIFICALLY relating to #pizzagate. The REMOVAL (NOT deletion) of irrelevant and unrelated information, regardless HOW interesting the poster may feel it to be, is NOT censorship, since the posts STILL EXIST. Moving information that is posted in the wrong place is not suppressing it, which is the definition of "censorship." So much of the concern and unhappiness and complaining about censorship here is misplaced.
               </p>
               <p>
                Please DO investigate for yourself. That is one of the main goals of this #pizzagate subverse, to let people investigate and draw their own conclusions. But that should ALSO apply to those who are screaming CENSORSHIP, and crying that their "free speech" is somehow being stifled. No it isn't. It is just being removed from this particular venue, SOLELY because it does NOT advance the investigation of #pizzagate, and is obfuscating the more important investigations going on, by the posting of irrelevant and unrelated bullshit.
               </p>
               <p>
                As for the gallant, yet misplaced sense of "frontier justice" spouted by so many about this subverse suffering from "abuse of power," the fact remains that THIS subverse CLEARLY states its purpose and its Rules for Submission. Those who cry the loudest seem to be those who cannot follow simple rules, and think that complaining will make the rules not apply to them. No one forced anyone to be here, just as no one is preventing them from leaving. If you don't like the heat, get out of the kitchen. If you cannot follow the rules, and do not like the consequences, please DO leave. You will not change the rules as they have been presented to us all, and you will NOT be allowed to break them with impunity. Your "free speech" is intact. Your irrelevant or unrelated submissions and comments are STILL on VOAT, just not here in #pizzagate. As has been suggested several times by others, go start your own subverse if you don't like this one. Preserve your image of what "free speech" means to you. But no one here needs your "steadfast vigilance" about those in power. This subverse was NOT created for YOU. The vast majority of members here (both Redditfugees and folk from the outside world) seem to have no issue with the subverse staying On Topic and On track. And, contrary to the complaints, those posts removed (which are still viewable), are not appropriate for THIS subverse. So maybe those unhappy should go start their own "FREE pizzagate," and repost their rants, their weird unrelated YouTube video links, and all the rest of it, for their perusal and appreciation. THIS is not the place, and the mods here are doing a fine job of helping to keep the "noise" to a dull roar, so that those of us who ARE capable of following the SIMPLE RULES, can continue to post, and investigate, and discuss, without the distractions said "noise" was creating.
               </p>
               <p>
                If people would apply half their concern and complaining about censorship to simply staying focused on the topic and NOT cluttering up the place with irrelevant and unrelated stuff, this whole situation would most likely fade away. STAY FOCUSED, and stop trying to derail the subverse with subversive clap trap about non-existent censorship. Click the links on the right and accept that the information was moved because it didn't belong HERE. But it was NOT deleted.
               </p>
               <p>
                And if you don't agree and you don't approve, then don't be here. We won't miss you leaving. Promise. NONE of us is that important. Get over yourselves.

                 "OP is astutely correct in stating that the built-in system of upvotes/downvotes is meant to avoid the need for heavy-handed moderator involvement and deletion of posts/comments." Says WHO? Upvotes/downvotes are only to show which topics/comments are "popular." They in NO WAY eliminate the need for moderator involvement. That is the purpose of the RULES FOR SUBMISSION. If people would SIMPLY follow the rules, moderator involvement would not be needed hardly at all, heavy-handed or otherwise.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Where the fuck did you come up with that upvote/downvote bullshit? #pizzagate is NOT a popularity subverse. Go try "hot or naw" for that shit.

                  The upvote/downvote comment was in relation to people whining about space being taken up by 'fake news'. If the front page of each subverse isn't some popularity contest, then why have voting at all? People push that 'up' vote for posts they think are important. They push the 'down' vote for unworthy posts.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Nowhere did I say that this subverse was made FOR me. That is a blatant strawman fallacy. I stated that I don't need others to decide FOR me what I see or not.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You come in with a sarcastic shit attitude and tell people to "STFU now." That is unhelpful. I do appreciate you pointing out that deleted posts and comments are still available to view. That is helpful. It's good to know there is one more layer of accountability.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  My point, which seems to have been lost in this, is that if Moderators are heavy-handed in deleting things, it will result in posts exactly like this one, which can create mistrust and divides within the community, and as you point out, takes time and energy away from valuable legitimate research.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You are the one attacking and trying to stifle conversation and telling others to leave this subverse. From a brief scan of your history you don't seem to be here to cause trouble, so how about a little mutual respect and tone down the sarcasm and negativity a bit? Please.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We're all here to deal with some heavy stuff and it can get people on edge, we should be able to rely on each other for support, not become hostile toward each other.

             It does have power, and that's why atko has said several times he want's free speech. If he wasn't so busy he could weigh in (or puttitout). The mods are supposed to delete spam and completely irrelevant topics. Not things they assume are not worthy of the sub. As a long time voater, it's sad you still haven't adopted that mentality, but instead adopt the reddit mentality (which KILLS sites in the long run).

              Thank you. If I had any points left to upvote today I would.

              If there is stupid actually fake shit posted, I will move past it and seek out the rest. I think anyone spending enough time on Internet forums would learn to do the same. Don't determine
              <strong>
               for me
              </strong>
              what I should or shouldn't see, I will decide this
              <strong>
               for myself.

              I'm all for deleting spam and profanity-laced cat memes in
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
               /v/pizzagate
              </a>
              (assuming these profanity-laced cat memes are not pizzagate-related), but if someone thinks that the Neo-Crypto-Zio-Cuck-O's are pulling all the pedo strings, let them post.
             </p>
             <p>
              If people continue to post fake and debunked stories, they will eventually get downvoted.
             </p>
             <p>
              We will recognize the shills by their post patterns - those seeking to divide, derail, discourage, dissuade, disparage, deny, degrade, denegrate, disturb, distort, and disinform - and we will call them out on their bullshit.
             </p>
             <p>
              That is much better than people questioning the motives of mods for deleting things.

               Decide for yourself, and follow the rules as you do so. What is being decided as not worthy of being here is NOT being decided for YOU. YOU have no importance here except as one of many. Get over yourself. When it is YOUR subverse being edited, THEN you can complain. But this is NOT your sandbox, bub. So YOU do NOT get to dictate when and how the mods here do their jobs. Learn to differentiate between what is YOURS and what you are merely a permitted VISITOR to. The majority of us can make that differentiation.

               This is what we want. And because I am 100% transparent, I am working with long time voaters through mail right now to clarify a few things about how the sub will run. If we get a couple hundred users you guys will be annoyed by shit posters but freed from censorship. It's
