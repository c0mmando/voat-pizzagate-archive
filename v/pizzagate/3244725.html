            What what!?!? You said Wisconsin that reminded me of a Static X song I haven't listened to in atleast 10+ years, "Wisconsin Death Trip" I searched the song and this was the second link on Google
            <a href="https://songmeanings.com/m/songs/view/19597/">
             https://songmeanings.com/m/songs/view/19597/
            </a>
            notice the first comment on those lyrics "Just a little bit of Static-X trivia here:
           </p>
           <p>
            The name of the album and the song Wisconsin Death Trip, according to Wayne Static, are from a book he found at a yard sale. It was full of pictures of dead bodies and babies in coffins, and he says it left an impact on him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just a little info on it...I don't see how it relates to this song, though. Any takers?"

            This comment is related to how the Beast system will be implemented ...
Just saw this vid.   It's relatively new and incredibly well done.   Watch to the very end.

            The link (i think) will show the  - list - of vid's put together by one YT user in regards to the topic of 5G and other interesting topics touching on the exti nc t ion of our species

             To kick off #PrideMonth I’ll be honoring this famous LGBT person Jeffrey Dahmer. A serial killer and a pedophile responsible for the death, rape and cannibalization of 17 men and boys. Dubbed the Milwaukee Cannibal , Dahmer is one of the most famous #LGBT people from Wisconsin.

               Judge Barry supposedly committed suicide at the Root River. I liked him.  He was a tough but fair jurist. I never believed it was suicide.
Dickert says he stayed with a friend while in NYC in order to save the city money.  Also suspect.

              Yes they did take malted milk, a favorite of NASA that "all druggists sell", but they took much more. Horlick was involved in many related groups including the Knights of Pythias, the Elks and Masons, and the Mystic Shrine, and was Knighted in Norway. He married his cousin, had four children, including Alice who died at age 11.

              There are tunnels under Horlick school and throughout the city. Mitt Romney was named after the quarterback of the Racine Legion NFL team that played at Horlick Field, where the Racine Belles won the first World Series. A different field was used in A League of Their Own, but Tom Hanks knows about Racine. Ask his son.

              The families that control Racine run generations deep, with abuse and pedophilia, mind control, grooming, bribery, blackmail, racketeering and other crimes. Sustainable Racine and Leadership Racine are two of the common pathways to ensure community leaders will follow the Agenda.

               , was Alfred Lawson relevant in any way to the truth? The land on which his 'University' was located in Racine, WI is now owned by Foxconn. Lawson was part of the early aviation industry in Wisconsin.  He then took interest in social cause and philosophy,  both of which relied heavily on his personal perspective,  and are regarded by most internet sources as crackpot theories.  There is a picture online of Lawson standing in downtown Racine awaiting the start of one of his direct- credit parades.  He is standing in front of one of Racine's early furniture stores. This store was also involved in the funeral industry and was connected to that part of it's business via underground tunnels.  Was Lawson connected to or did he have knowledge of any of the things that went on concerning the "Root"?

              Racine means "Root", and the Root River plays an important role. Machinery Row was a corrupt development deal along the Root River, and the water deals in the region leverage the river also. The newspaper helped locate the straw man investor, linked through Freemason groups to push the development deal, and everything fell apart when the kickbacks started being scrutinized.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Root River Council is absolutely corrupt and comprised of criminals, and serves as one of many more corrupt arms in the community. Greening Greater Racine, DRC, RAMAC, Rotary and the Sustainable Business Network are a few others. The list is long.

             <p>
              Milwaukee 7 is a main part of the water control mechanism linked with major PACs and think-tanks including Aspen and Brookings among others. The Marquette Mafia is one of the groups that control the courts and ensures none of them are held accountable.

              How did SC Johnson secure such a great water "deal" with a corrupt pedophile mayor? Why was he eventually forced out of office?

               Hey,@TrustTheTruth, you've talked about exposing "the root", aka the "bottom of the pyramid", which you say is in Racine.  Are there any individuals living in Racine who are higher up on the pyramid of power who don't hold public positions? If so,  please provide some clues. Also,  you've mentioned that there are active serial killers in the vicinity of Racine.  Will you provide clues regarding people involved or locations at which they practice their craft?

             , Admiral Byrd supposedly brought malted milk to Antarctica.  Lots of it. This is connected to William and James Horlick. Their family owned and operated at least one quarry in Racine.  James was trained to be a pharmacist in London before he went to Racine.  This family was involved in manufacturing,  resource acquisition,  and aviation. Should I extrapolate on this with specific regard to the malted milk?

             I tried all weekend to figure out what you’re saying about Racine, even think I found you commenting as ‘a.b. see’ here.

             I still cannot figure anything out. Can you just say what it is you want people to figure out, cause if you don’t speak up, then aren’t you like the rest that you complain about?

             Would you change your mind about Q and trump if they charge the traitors? Causr thats where declass is leading to. You say they wont be imprisoned but i think they will. Soon. Trump is good. Q is good. You say stuff that are interesting I'm not gonna lie but you don't predict like Q does. Q says something and then shit happens after. Q is good. You saying it's bad makes me believe you are shilling. You do got very interesting talking points though. Almost like imitating Q to be honest.

              Trump was given The Opportunity long before he accepted the nomination.

             <p>
              They were given the Opportunity to Repent and Reveal The Truth for All.
             </p>
             <p>
              Instead Trump closed The Deal from the public, and Q flooded Voat.

               Yeah maybe some of the other information is correct, haven't dug deep on it, but stating Trump is one of them, believing OP is much less likely now. Pretty concrete at this point Trump is fighting them, politically and spiritually. If you were truly on the side of good, you would know this truth yourself for reasons you wouldn't be able to deny.

             Donald Trump is on our side fool. That's how I know you are shilling. Why is the deepstate media attacking Trump if he's supposedly on their side? Cause he's not he's a patriot. Trump is good. Even though I like what you say but the Trump is bad part makes me believe you are a shill. You fucked up. Mark taylor a man of God said Trump is fighting the illuminati/NWO. Trump was chosen by God. The right man for the job. I am not suicidal and never plan on killing myself. Love life. MAGA.

            I've asked as well and have never received received an explanation but my theory is that there are very very few researchers here and a lot of paid shills.  I used to come here daily when the reddit purge happened and now its once a month.  Coincidence?  No I'll say it one more time for everyone not listening.  Divide and conquer.

            Field McConnell keeps talking about Wisconsin and all the pedos that live here.  thank you for the info you have included, I’m going to start digging on this also.  I live in Wisconsin and am totally naive about what apparently has gone in here.  Field has said that Paul Ryan, Reince Preibus and Ron Johnson are part a part of the problem.  Racine doesn’t surprise me - same players there as in Milwaukee and Madison....also it is so close to Chicago.  Thanks for the start - I’m going to go back and watch a few of Fields old videos and see if there is more info.......

             No coincidence that Travis and DJ AM had a hit on them in 2008 and lo/behold, DJ AM dies of a “DRUG OVERDOSE” (uh huh) less than a year later.
