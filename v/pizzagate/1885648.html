            The PR guy is working for free.   After Assange pushed this assassination conspiracy, the family was flooded with media requests and wanted someone to help them.   They asked Seth's friends and they recommended Bauman.  Bauman has never worked for the DNC.   He has worked for several progressive causes.

            So many of your assumptions are wrong.

            ** this Seth story may just be a false flag event. None of it really makes any sense as to why if Seth did not leak the Podesta emails, only the shit about Bernie, why kill him?**
           </p>
           <p>
            I honestly think this Rich family is somehow in with at least some part of pizzagate! Either they are Pedos, or Seth was a victim of Pedos.
A grown man carrying around  stuffed panda bears is not normal. 
The video on the day of Seth's funeral made by his parents &amp; brother, way too obvious that the panda was used as a Pedo symbol! 
Not buying the story Seth was only at the DNC cuz he loved Bernie! Nor that he just happened on to a voting scam either. 
Seth was put there, so now the question is who put him there, and why?

             Well if Panda was the name he went by on the Internet you could also interpret  the panda as a symbol pointing to his pseudonym

            As you pull things off the front pages you lose viewers and sometimes a good tip because not everyone knows  about subverses. To prove this point, llook at how many people visit one site vs another   This is part of pizza gate that could potentially unravel the whole ball.  I say we trudge on and more likely than not Rich info will slow down as time passes as everything else does.

            I would love to know this, as well. The DNC offered $0 reward money for finding Seth's killers, but they're spending big bucks on this PR Crisis spokesperson for the family?

            Seth Rich seems to be connected to Pizzagate.  A new subverse would make it harder to find out just how tightly they are connected.  I vote against moving the discussion and I think it should be assumed there is a connection so folks don't have to specify it all the time.

             It is connected only because both are major cases of corruption/evil connected to Clinton and the DNC.  How else is it connected?  Seth Rich didn't have anything to do with the Podesta emails, as far as we know.

             And I predict that the Seth Rich psyop is going to lead us round and round in circles until we're so dizzy we forget what we're investigating in the first place.

              THIS.  There seem to be so many newfound  discoveries and many of them we just can't prove.  We must take their word for it.  So many are willing to jump on the bandwagon of the 4chans.  I am the first one to admit they certainly are very enticing and hey, maybe one or two of them have some truth.  But remember that they would just love to get us off track. That is the mission of CTR Share Blue and all the shills they have bought.

               THANK YOU! I was just thinking this! These people are the masters of propaganda; they know this would be an easy way to distract us. Seth Rich has taken over not only on Voat, but Twitter as well, and has all but drowned out all new leads. Until we have more physical evidence in Seth Rich's case (and not just "anons" posting on 4chan), we have to keep moving forward with Pizzagate/Pedogate. Anyone can say they're someone familiar with Seth Rich &amp; drop disinfo to lead us off the path. Then, if nothing ever comes to light, we look even crazier to the normies than we already do.

                I have been looking into Seth Rich ever since I sat on my couch crying on the morning of July 10th.  There have been crazy things said up until now, but not as crazy as this last weekend.  They are coming out of the woodwork (the rats) trying to lead us down one after another path hoping to keep us dizzy and bizzy.  I am not falling for it  They want to discredit the family and even are trying to plant the idea of pedophilia into our heads about the family and even Seth, one reason being just because they are from Omaha or a Panda.  Hey, Anyone want to buy a Brooklyn Bridge?

                 Exactly. There have been so many unsubstantiated claims made recently about this; then the big build up with Kim dotcom and Hannity, and THEN...nothing. There is almost too much evidence - which makes it seem like they want us to find it. Either way, at some point we've got to move forward with Pizzagate. If Seth Rich is a psyop, it was done specifically with us in mind, which means they are scared.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But I do wonder, if this all is a psyop, what would they have to gain by it? If the fact that he was murdered does finally come to light and exposes the DNC, what would they be getting from that? Not to mention it would also make Wikileaks look even more credible, and Pizzagate along with it. But again, why? Unless they own Wikileaks and would then use that to further another agenda. I have heard rumblings that Wikileaks was compromised, but I wasn't ever sure what to think of that. Anyway, I digress...

                  There are so many forks at the end of this road that it makes you want to pull your hair out.  I think the evidence they want us to find, is their made up evidence.  They are seeing if we will bite and how much.  There is one bit of evidence that had me interested and that is of the Dr. that visited the WH.  But  I thought that Trump put a lock on the records. Are we accepting this with out a source?  Not saying it isn't true, but we used to ask for sources.   I think we are all tired of all this and want this to end.  But we know we have to keep going.  I am not going to let them get to me.

              I disagree in that it involves the same criminals and would work to destroy the Russia narrative, opening up lots of folks to the idea that they are super-criminals(like Hillary's superpredators) and that PG is worth looking into. I'm not sold on moving Seth news to a subverse just yet.

               If there is already a subverse than any further discussion is moot.  The Clintons and Podestas are involved in a number of  dubious enterprises and there have been a boatload of homicides  connected  to the Clintons but we simply cannot address them all on a pizzagate subverse.We have got to draw a line somewhere and all lines have an arbitrary aspect that make them unpalatable but it's the only way to keep these two separate issues segregated.. More importantly, its the only way to spare pizzagate from being overrun by the Seth Rich mystery. I am not suggesting Seth Richs murder is not important, its extremely important but it is diluting pizzagate precisely because of It's importance.
