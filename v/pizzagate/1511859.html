            I understand your point though you basically pointed out yourself that they'll frame us no matter what we do. I am willing to meet your position half way. I don't want to incriminate or drag down the major source of Pizzagate research but I also want to ensure the right information gets out there. I wouldn't mind setting these subs to private once sufficiently set up. It would allow operations to proceed without allowing shills to scapegoat easily.

             Having spoken to Britt I think she's completely authentic and I trust her. Seaman and the others as far as I'm concerned they're a means to spread information. We can't spread our message if we accuse everyone of being a shill including those on our side.

            Might I ask, are these new sub-voats going to be specific to a certain aspect of the research?  I ask because, in my opinion, though I do okay in a "scattergram" approach to research, I don't think most people do, and having the main sub being a sort-of "shotgun" free-for-all, diffuses the focus and makes it hard to stay on target.  Have we considered the possibility of forcing all "DC" related investigations to one page; Child Trafficking and CP in general to another, etc.?  This might help consolidate the findings and allow each person to focus their attention on one area.

             PP2 will basically focus on spreading information through proxies and PP3 will basically involve joke warfare.

             I don't disagree with compartmentalizing categories of research. In the military we divide our battalions by numerical shops. 1 for administration, 4 for supply, etc. It's a shame the Voat system doesn't allow for multiple stickies because it'd be useful in keeping track of specific topics.
