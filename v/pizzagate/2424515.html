<p>As we all know I\'m sure, the left-right dichotomy is a tool the elites use to keep the population divided within this &quot;offered&quot; 2 party system, where there are only two acceptable social/political platforms you can identify with. We accept the nature of the reality we are presented with, but many don\'t realize that this is an ancient tool the ruling classes have implemented to keep people under their control for many years. </p>
<p>Part of what makes the conspiracy community and the truth movement so appealing, is that we traditionally reject the &quot;WWE&quot; style staged theatrics of partisan politics. This non partisan appeal has enticed a lot of people on the spectrum who are fed up with the system, to abandon their partisan stances and embrace our rejection of the offered political arena. This ultimately helps us gain more followers and become a greater force in the world, that the elites are forced to deal with. </p>
<p>What I have noticed since about mid 2015, is what seems to be an intentional &quot;merging&quot; of the conspiracy culture, with partisan right/republican politics. This involved the media, planted disinfo gatekeepers, and the current administration, and it\'s reinforced by a paid online astroturfing campaign. I think Donald Trump, who presented himself as an &quot;anti establishment&quot; candidate, was largely responsible for this shift, with his rejection of political correctness and outspoken persona. <strong>However, I\'m starting to consider the possibility that he was selected by the elites under this basis, as an opportunist to appeal to the masses who are fed up with the current system.</strong> </p>
<p>To me, this particular election seemed to have a scripted &quot;good cop/bad cop&quot; feel to it. I felt like (after the MSM catapulted Trump to the spotlight, ensuring him the nomination), that I was being engineered to see Trump as an &quot;outsider good guy&quot; against Hillary\'s &quot;villain&quot; reputation. I think the social engineers took this into account when/if they developed the narrative for this election, as they always do. </p>
<p>I believe we are in a new era of media manipulation, where reverse psychology by the MSM is now used to steer us and nudge us in certain directions. By attacking something, they can add legitimacy to it, and I believe the media &quot;attacks&quot; on Trump are a large part of why many people support him. They took the bait of, &quot;If the media attacks him, he must be on our side&quot;. By attacking him, the media actually were giving him tons of free publicity, which is HUGELY helpful in choosing the party nominees. Real outsiders, like Ron Paul, get total silence from the MSM. </p>
<p>I also took note of how formerly trustworthy alternative media figures like Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson, seemed to abandon their non-partisan stances in unison, to support Trump for his 2015 run, effectively leading their followers and viewers to the pro-Trump bias, and merging our culture with that side of the paradigm. Remember, Alex Jones issued a formal apology to James Alefantis claiming Pizzagate was fake, and he issued that apology <strong>The day before the protest in DC</strong>. The elites often use AJ as bait, and as a way to demonize and sabotage elements of the truth movement. He was potentially planted in advance, or co-opted by them some years ago. </p>

<p>He even took away the ability to comment on that video. </p>
<p>With all of this in mind, <strong>Is it possible the social engineers had this massive &quot;trojan horse&quot; psy op planned years in advance, and implemented it in 2016 as a way to subvert and destroy the truth movement?</strong></p>
<p>I saw MANY examples of the MSM linking the Pizzagate investigation with &quot;alt right&quot; and &quot;pro trump&quot; labels. Perhaps they are trying to destroy that non-partisan appeal, by baiting us with a fake anti-establushment populist-puppet president, and &quot;sucking&quot; us into taking a stance on the left right paradigm. </p>

<p>This way they can lump in conspiracy theorists and PG researchers with the &quot;alt right&quot; and &quot;conservative extremists&quot; in the media, as well as &quot;anti semetic&quot; and &quot;homophobic and sexist&quot; as they usually do. This partisan branding of our investigation is not helpful at all. We need to be able to appeal to both sides of the spectrum.</p>
<p>This all seems like part of their plan to drive a wedge between the population using their phony little left/right paradigm of control, and taint the conspiracy culture\'s cause of exposing the New World Order and the pedocracy.</p>',

            It's good to finally see a thread that stayed up that puts these questions to the test..  and I still see that not everyone is quite willing to give up hope for "Q" and Trump,  even though most of you are willing to entertain the idea,  from what I gather is primarily from an instinctual perception, which is often right by the way.  What I see more of though is chaos and confusion.
           </p>
           <p>
            You are indeed right when you correctly observe the merging of "conspiracy theorists"  gradually and incrementally associated with the "alt-right" and "conservative" republican base that can be loosely associated to the neo-nazi movement. It's a reality.  Alex Jones hyperactivity and cointell operation is indeed in the business of inciting and militarizing his paranoid listeners so that he could be used as the perfect example for that link,  and from there it is easy to categorize everyone into the Jones paradigm. The only answer is to come correct and heavily armed with the proper knowledge and to be able to deliver it with the precision of a wizard casting a spell. I don't know anyone personally with that kind of knowledge, power and strength because,  it seems,  so few of us are left uncorrupted and damaged from this experience.

            When Henry Kissinger was telling the world that it does not matter what the common man thought about the New World Order if he wanted it or not it was an inevitability they had to accept because it was coming one way or the other. He was also telling us that our worlds would be getting much smaller as well. I could already see what he meant by corporate and media control,  monopolies and tighter government regulations,  but he was also speaking about the internet with AI and fusion centers that could metadata absolutely any 'threat'  that threatens that future system. It's really here folks. Google,  YouTube and Twitter didn't 'hire' new help AI has been initiated that is beginning to pick us out of the lineup and collate our metadata.

            We are losing our 'idols'. Everyday we find out about how dirty everyone that was an influential part in many of our lives are turning out to be complete demons. It's almost as though it is a trigger and siren call for the wanton and morally corrupt to rise up,  while those of us that are left with a conscience,  hope and morals  are caste into doubt,  despair and confusion.
           </p>

            The key is to always remember that it is by design.

            Your entire life has been a traumatic and MK-Ultra level shock therapy session. Your schooling and entertainment has embedded so many emotional triggers you are cycling through a million transactions a second in your mind. They are counting on you being a dysfunctional mess.
           </p>
           <p>
            The key to freedom is understanding your worthlessness first,  then you will understand the motivation and driving distortions that were implanted in you since birth,  then understanding your real worth and knowing that you were once whole bright and beautiful before you were filled with their brand of conditioning. Know that this confusion, feelings of loneliness,  worthlessness and despair is a condition created solely and entirely by THEM.  This is the trick that is told as a 'devils' story because Satan's trick is to convince you that everything is all your fault,  that human beings are sinners by nature and corrupted from the start,  not true if all those conditions are created by 'them' to begin with.
           </p>
           <p>
            These conditions are created,  all of it,  to make you internalize your entire life into religious terms of good verses evil,  it really is an end times battle that amounts to an eternal struggle of good and evil within each of us. However there is a bit of a twist it all having been created by man. It is all nothing but an illusion. God understands. That's why YOU are already forgiven (if you repent). God may not act in a manner obvious to man but these instigators know they will not get away with it in the long run.
           </p>
           <p>
            I see this type of confusion in everyone,  everywhere. PTSD'd,  scared and worried adults being driven into their cycles out of fear. Fear for themselves,  their family,  the country and the world. I see so many divergent opinions,  differing belief systems it seems that every individual has something about a conspiracy that is just a little bit different from what someone else believes and those ideas often clash.  I see (and have myself) some mental illness that leaks into posts or discussions. I see completely sane and competent men throw their hands to their face.

            I saw weeping and gnashing of teeth.

            It's time to take stock and realize, analyze and take stock in the games these ppl are playing to occupy our time,  confuse us,  push us away and ultimately drive us insane.

            Trump wasn't always the way he is now.  He was friends with Hillary, friends with Rudy Giuliani.

            Paul Joseph Watson and Milo rose to fame quickly. Let's face it, the media only shines a light on who they want elevated. Like you said, good guys like on Ron Paul are ignored. The election fight still goes on today and in the meantime, bombs are being dropped on innocent civilians like never before.

              This way they can lump in conspiracy theorists and PG researchers with the "alt right" and "conservative extremists" in the media, as well as "anti semetic" and "homophobic and sexist" as they usually do. This partisan branding of our investigation is not helpful at all. We need to be able to appeal to both sides of the spectrum.

            My two cents on trump come primarily from "yes we can" vs "make America great again" as campaign slogans.  Obama vs trump.  I don't vote because I campaigned for Ron Paul in 2008 and saw exactly how he was kept from having any chance.  If you buy a reverse speech app and record above two slogans and then reverse them, you get interesting results.  The reverse of "yes we can" sounds like "thank you Satan" while "make America great again" sounds roughly like "make America great again".  I've tested this against many people and all have agreed on the "yes we can" reversal.  The second reversal is more questionable to some.  My point is that whoever trump is, he knows the in crowd and is talking to them.  The only question to me is if he drains the swamp or not.  Either way, We the People are the government.  Not these pizzagate assholes.  Remember that and we have a chance to right the wrongs.

            You have a point. I don't think it plays out that way. If Trump is a plant then why would they allow him to make EOs that drop the hammer on HT? Alt-right is connected to the truthers because HRC and her crime ring is on the left. The truthers have been on to her for a long time. I think your idea holds water for the simple fact no one has been locked up.

            As far as subverting the conspiracy crowd, (((they))) have been doing that for a long time as well. Things like crop circle hoaxs, faked UFO pictures are a couple of examples. Now days it's things like flat earth. People know something isn't right but are too stupid to figure out what it is, so they are fed alternate theories that sane truthers know is bullshit. All too make people question what to believe as truth. Shadow of a doubt, and plausible deny ability are phares invented by these degenerates.

            Using a White Knight "white hat" savior figure is a bread and butter technique the elite use to keep humanity from assembling on their own behalf. D.C. is thoroughly corrupted and there are no "white hats." It is our job to redpill our brothers and sisters to the "two party" trick so that all common peoples will unite against the elite. Neither party cares about us and when a large enough group of people realize that we will run them out of our hair.

            A few things in reply to this:
           </p>
           <p>
            1.) Pizzagate started with leaked emails. I've said this many times, but unless the left leaked those emails themselves (and this would mean much more than just Seth Rich) they had no way of knowing what connections would be made once they were in the public domain.
           </p>
           <p>
            2.) Pizzagate's 'hub', if you will, was initially 'The Donald' and then moved to Voat when it got shut down on Reddit, with the chans an ever-present as well; all of which are right-leaning sites. So it wasn't that the mainstream media made it a right-centred thing, it kinda already was.
           </p>
           <p>
            3.) The 'work' of Media matters/ShareBlue/Crew/American Bridge has been to create a narrative and create an agenda. They are literally using anything and everything to smear anyone that is right of centre, from Trump all the way down to us, Pizzagate actions very much included as well as censorship drives and the creation of bots to drive news and opinions through fake social media profiles etc. This has all shown us that the left pretty much own the media, at least the agenda driving media, which makes it very easy for them to label something and it become a part of most people's vernacular.
           </p>
           <p>
            4.) The left aren't that smart. They're dirty, scheming and underhanded, but they're not that smart to have had this all planned out.

             The right is an intentional straw man. It is created and propped up against the wall as a public target so that the media can teach the masses "this is bad, don't be this, you men, don't be masculine, Christian, and good morals are wrong."

             Meanwhile our TV commercials and shows are full of feminized males and many kinds of deviant behavior as the model of "what we should aspire to be." Its all a big social engineering psyop.

            I don't understand people's addiction to Trump. He's an elite himself, with multiple sexual harassment and rape claims. That goes against everything this sub stands for. Yet the majority of people here seem to want to ignore that because it doesn't fit their worldview. If he were anyone else, they would be all over it. This whole thing has been one orchestrated event, down to the Podesta emails being released (only 30 minutes after someone leaked Trump's pussy tape...hmmm). It's time for people to take the blinders off. Maybe then we could actually make some change.

             Trump false hopes are stifling the collective creative thinking abilities of the truth community. Instead of coming up with ever more clever ways to shake off our parasitic overlords people are stuck in bickering over the fake false left/right paradigm just as it is intended to work.

              Exactly. It's too much gloom and doom for some people to wrap their heads around. They need to feel like someone is going to fight for them. Having to fight for themselves is completely beyond their scope; they can't even comprehend it. It's incredible, really, and it completely prohibits any progress we could make. People won't see what they don't want to see.

             Selling false hope keeps the herd calm so that it won't take real action. The elites have been using false hope for thousands of years to lulz the masses. It was the very last thing to escape from Pandora's box, because when false hope leaves, all hell breaks loose for the elites.

             Aldous Huxley said that if humanity unites against its oppressor that humanity would "shake off it's oppressors as a horse shakes off flies." The left/right paradigm is the ultimate game of Hegelian Dialectic, duality, divide and conquer.

             Just look what the left/game has done to this forum, it divided it, and I think Q may have been sent into the truth community to divide the truth community. Even if Q was not sent intentionally it has worked wonders to divide the truth community because now instead of being focused on our over lords people are bickering over Q.

            One thing I never understood as a Canadian / somewhat neutral third party.

           <p>
            Like you believe that the entire government of the US is corrupt, it does seem that way to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            You believe that a few people have a large power over corporations which in reality control the government, great so do I.
           </p>
           <p>
            You believe that these people are immoral and satanic? Yeah so do I.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet you believe a presidential candidate will make a difference? I don't get that, I really don't. You support conservative values over liberal values, so you vote republican, I get that part. What I don't get is the part where you forget that the people in power remain the same no matter who gets elected and you start believing that trump will actually make a change. Or do you believe that if he was really a threat to things that actually matter (i.e. money and power) like for example I dunno, JFK, he wouldn't get assassinated?
           </p>
           <p>
            Imo it's pretty clear that the president of the US is nothing more than a figurehead, and that the choice is between a gun loving (well at least he portrayed himself as such) puppet for the corporations or a transgender loving puppet for the corporations. I understand you'll vote for one over the other but at the end of the day don't forget it's a puppet. And recent events show that even the little power your vote has (choosing someone who defends guns for example) is also a lie, they'll turn back on those promises as well.

             Very true. The nonpartisan hope for Trump (or someone in his place), is that the clamor for justice will motivate such one, perhaps out of ego, to step up and be an instrument of justice. If that one survives, they will still be serving their ego, but we will get our justice. We should have no illusions: such a person may not be virtuous. Cyrus, in the Bible, fulfilled a similar role, liberating the remaining loyal Israelites from Babylon, but he was likely a ruthless military leader from a violent dynasty.

             I agree completely. If who we voted for, regardless of the country, would actually make a direct difference, we wouldn't be allowed to vote for them. Look at the EU delegates. They are not voted for by the people. All of the changes in Europe are made by the deep state and always have been.

            <p>
             Trump is the "hero" for the right but has a Jewish daughter. Why does the US still have its head so far up Israel's ass? These are all false sides made by the media. There is no "left" and "right" the way they are putting it. And like
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/imlostwhereisreddit">
              @imlostwhereisreddit
             </a>
             is saying, the characteristics of who falls under these categories is constructed by the media.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are certain laws that will never change. For example, any country that threatens America's holy petrodollar will get smashed. The European countries are and will remain vassal states of the US.

             If the government wants to one day take away your guns or internet, it will. You really have nothing to say on the matter.

            As long as child traffickers, rapists, molesters, porn, abusers, etc are being rounded up, jailed, indicted (including sealed) then TRUMP HAS MY SUPPORT UNTIL THE WHEELS FALL OFF.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have to have faith that white hats are doing their part.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we avoid taking a side out of fear that we’ll look like fools then we will have fallen for an even more dirty trick than “mistakenly supporting Trump”
           </p>
           <p>
            Supporting trump has no downside potential. Only we look a little foolish for believing that he would save the children.
           </p>
           <p>
            NOT SUPPORTING Trump has a lot of negative side effects.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need to unite behind the team who is jailing sickos until we learn otherwise.
           </p>
           <p>
            Note: I don’t know if Trump is for real or not, and I don’t think any of us (civilians) do BUT I choose to watch his actions that matter the most. (i.e he supports Israel which boggles my mind BUT stopping the trafficking of children imo takes priority over waging war with the Jews —especially right out the gate as a newly elected President without a united country behind him etc)
           </p>

            If he saves the kids... then the entire country will support him. And we’ll all likely (due to public disclosure) know that the JEWS are the pedophile cult leaders and thus a war against the Jews will be easy to win (in perfect alignment with crypto currency transition away from central banks)
           </p>
           <p>
            Might be wishful thinking but I’m fighting for the kids so either way I’m on his mission to the end.

            When QAnon appeared, I gave Milo, Alex and PJW the benefit of the doubt for burying PizzaGate thinking that maybe they'd been politely asked by Trump insiders to drop it until the "takedown" plan was ready.  Remember that Milo scheduled a talk on PizzaGate but said he received calls from people in DC saying "not yet."  That was over a year ago though, and like most people, my patience is wearing pretty thin.  QAnon gave us the impression that our enemies were weak and on their last legs....but they are walking free, Tweeting, censoring and carrying out false flag shootings with impunity.  If it turns out that QAnon is a psy-op to make us all stand down, I will become incredibly enraged.

              Q isn't saying we should stand down though. We need to spread the word about the corruption. And I think the faster we raise public awareness the more the Trump administration will dare to make public action against the deep state.
             </p>
             <p>
              If the public is aware then it matters less and less what the current administration tries to do.

              I agree. Q is a reassuring anecdote that white hats are hard at work. But we hold the white hats accountable and thus need to double our efforts now more than ever.

               In this sense, Q reminds me of Cobra, who I am pretty sure is a psyop.  Plus they both do odd coded messages.
              </p>
              <p>
               I do wonder whether this is all just a power struggle within the NWO.  Could be the Rockefeller/Bush/Neocon/Christian Zionist faction is pissed that the Rothschild/Soros/Commie/Rapefugee faction has become too dominant.  The former faction is mainly America-based and therefore to claim a larger part of the NWO pie, they must MAGA and kick their rivals off their turf.  Hence Trump and Q.  The Illuminati equivalent of a mafia war would also explain why Q has said little if anything about the Bushes and the Rockefellers even though we know they are part of the problem.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm not really advocating this conspiracy theory about Q just yet.  I'm just questioning everything and seeking comments, because I have been deceived more times than I care to remember.
              </p>
              <p>
               The problem with this theory is that even during the middle of a war, the mafia families all agree that the swamp must remain, extortion must be paid, cops and judges must be corrupt, the public must remain in the dark about the true extent of the corruption, etc.  The fact that Q went to 8chan of all places and told them to redpill the masses doesn't make sense in this context.  The fact that he alludes to Pizzagate doesn't make any sense unless he was also pushing some insane alien woowoo that would later be used to discredit Pizzagate by association.  Q doesn't do this.  He hasn't said anything that's insane (to us).  The only major part of the story we didn't already know was the North Korea angle and even there, some of us started to get suspicious when Kim acted up soon after Trump took office.
              </p>
              <p>
               Hopefully we'll get some confirmation shortly with the 13,000 sealed indictments, etc.  People are starting to get antsy.

               The best actors go to Washington D.C. and the leftovers go to Hollywood. There are no "white hats" and the sooner we teach our brother and sisters this truth the sooner we will have enough people to get rid of the elite.

               Perhaps Q is the online propaganda that is supposed to reassure us that Trump and his goons are taking care of things for us? I'm starting to think Q is some part of disinfo in this psyop. He also acts as positive PR for Trump with the online community.

             Yes, a lot of us have been thinking it.  We've witnessed so much deception in our lives that we can't help but think it.  That said, it's not good to be one of those people that dismisses everything as a conspiracy or a psy-op and then wallows in misery and self-pity and never actually does anything.

            I never thought I'd side with Trump but it seems like there's an 'abandoning his base' chill factor being played out on social media atm, same thing happened after his response to Syrian "gas attacks". The current MSM modus operandi is to label anything threatening their agenda as far-right/Nazi, including us. I think most people with half a brain can see that PG involves both sides, just mention Dennis Hastert. I'm holding out hope for Trump right now, I still believe his win wasn't anticipated and deep state are feeling the heat, if TPTB have become sophisticated enough in their psy ops to pull off the last 18 months then I give up

            The left is mostly calling the right wingers conspiracy theorists over us thinking their party rapes and murders children, that they're the true racists, that they're controlled by jewish interests above all others, etc.  You have to understand that all that kind of stuff goes against their programming so it sounds crazy to the average normie and downright turns you into a crazy nazi if you continue talking to them about it.

            As for the media they've obviously been infected by the jews and cia into manipulating the masses but at the same time they also go with what gets them attention so they'll ignore the lesser candidates and bash trump over and over again replacing the dead horse as needed because it's all about the ad revenue to them.  It would actually be interesting to see their books to see which groups are giving them over the top amounts of money for advertising as that would likely expose the jews, cia, etc. that bribe people using over payment for services rendered instead of the market value of their work but without viewers it would all be for nothing anyway so they do what they must to draw them in and calling half the population a bunch of conspiritards does that very effectively as it gives them a sense of superiority, a feeling of being an underdog when their enemy is in power, etc. is extremely effective at drawing in the r type bred, subhuman pieces of shit in like moths to a flame and they feel united together in their mob rule, sorry democratic rule, because of it and anyone who goes against their now "proven" greater good is literally attacking not only them but society as a whole with their stupidity above all else and they feel morally obliged to stop it.

            To be honest I'm not overly convinced that trump was tapped for presidency by the elites like the bushes and clintons have been but that said he's certainly helped them a whole lot more than the average joe which he's also done tons for too, it's just the elite benefit more and while I firmly believe that hillary would have helped them in the long term with all her commie bullshit, in the short term they benefit more with trump.  The scary thing to me is that we're due for another worldwide downturn so they really could have given trump their approval to cash out at the last moment before putting their commie in power to seize everything for cents on the dollar as it's not like history wouldn't be repeating itself yet again if that were the case...

              You're certainly an idealist.  I think they'll instead act like the neighbours of a battered wife and think if it was really that bad they'd have done something about it now and turn a blind eye to it instead.

            that is now becoming my biggest fear.. they r so brazen that pizzagate might be a big joke to them and. as a way to out their opponents for when the time comes to round up dissidents. its scary times. just the other day i saw a picture of Trump holding a sign. that sald."Trump digs coal" isnt that a euphamism for being gay? they r all wickes deceiving sodomites. it now appears we r in for some major shit.. Get right with the true Jesus Christ, not the nicolaitain roman counterfiet because Satan is going to begin his final offensive. God wins but things r gonna get messy for all those who bear the mark of the beast ( roman worship)

             No worries fellow pizzagate researchers, I am at the center of their joke. They reference me,torment me by using my name, my identity in their sickness. I'm not lying and I love God dearly.

             The elites may practice satanism and dark religion, but just because they believe in it doesn't mean I have to. I don't subscribe to the organized religion concept. It too seems to be just a tool of control. I recommend listening to some interviews from Dr. Timothy Leary.

            I think that, if pizzagate is real, the last thing they would want is to legitimize the theorists by enveloping them within the right. I've had a lot of success convincing many of my friends and family on the right that it is real (and almost as big a problem on the right as on the left) because of the growing rightist awakening phenomenon to many historically dismissed conspiracy theories (like JFK being assassinated, the Rothschild-Illuminati-NWO stuff, etc). These people were all dismissive of conspiracy theories in the past, and heck I was too, but pizzagate really opened the floodgates. Really, there's no way that the elites would intentionally dump pizzagate out there, people knowing that the rulers of the world are literally satanic child rapist/murderers? They'd all be burned alive in the streets by mobs if people suddenly found out en-mass. As well, I don't think it could ever be controlled to their benefit, even if they tried it. The pizzagate conspiracy means you can pretty much never trust any elite with government power, you can never trust anyone who has been in government for any appreciable length of time. Everyone who believes pizzagate is real will seek to elect outsiders and nobodies, normal people, with no experience but demonstrably without any connections to existing power structure. That sentiment could never be leveraged effectively by the elites to retain power.

            Well put djklbd. I have always been suspicious of Trump, because it is not in an elite's best interest to reduce the power of the elites. I fear he is a pied piper, and your post makes a lot of sense to me.  We must continue to be nonpartisan in the pursuit of justice, and not be manipulated by TBTB.

             I see both sides. Its a great post, and your suspicions of Trump have merit (especially with the seeming inaction of Sessions). But I can also still have faith in the idea that Trump, having been a billionaire all his adult life is defying the Elite not out of shared humility with the 'little people' - but that his sense of ambition now transcends financial wealth and he is seeking Historical LEGACY
            </p>
            <p>
             and in that capacity, the Restoration of America to its greatness and former ethical ascendancy is a viable strategy

              Trump wants his legacy to be judged by his peers, and we are not his peers.

                I'm of the opinion that he is probably doing that just as other presidents have. Behind the scenes through various shell companies and affiliations I feel like he will come out of this much better than when he went in. His family is "running the business now" as we were told.

             Precisely. And it definitely gets you motivated when you are aware of the techniques being used against you, but your fellow man isnt.

             So, we have to present our cause in a way that the common person can digest. Remaining non partisan, and not taking a stance politically is a great start. We all know the pedocracy exists on both sides.

            I didn't read the post, just the Title. Out of the days of this test that God gives us. His sings point to yes. You have trump supports, even left supports acting like the gov is a hero and going to save the day. People get paid to shill. If the government pays millions to find the right tasting ketchup (John Kerry's wife got a lot of money for that one), they'll do anything to lead the sheep, that God will vail because they wouldn't know any better anyways.
