<p>Something very profound happened in the U.S. on December 21 with the passage of President Donald Trump’s “Executive Order Blocking the Property of Persons Involved in Serious Human Rights Abuse or Corruption”.  The order declared a state of national emergency concerning human rights and corruption, and named specific individuals and organizations that would have their bank accounts and assets frozen regardless of where in the world the abuses had occurred. </p>
<p>While the mainstream media has largely ignored Trump’s Executive Order, the alternative media has been paying close attention. Many have noted the Executive Order is far more significant than what it appears to be on the surface. Rather than just freezing the financial resources of foreign citizens linked to the Russian sphere of influence, as it superficially appears to do, it is really targeted at members of the “Deep State” (aka Cabal or Illuminati)  that have been involved in human trafficking, pedophilia and systemic corruption all over the planet.</p>
<p>Its annex identifies key individuals and organizations, several of whom are clearly associated with Russia. The Executive Order is linked to the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act that emerged from the murder of a prominent dissident exposing human rights abuses and corruption in Russia. 
This linkage can easily lead readers into falsely believing that the Executive Order is solely intended to target corrupt Russian officials, and corruption and human rights abuses by countries in Russia’s sphere of influence.</p>
<p>Yet, as a number of alternative media sources point out, Trump’s Executive Order goes well beyond the Russian sphere of influence. It is really targeting the Deep State, and fulfilling his 2016 campaign pledge to “drain the swamp” . </p>
<p>For example, Jim Stone, a freelance journalist, writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The executive order is presented as a national emergency up front, right in the beginning. At first it reads like he’s going after foreigners which are named directly in an annex at the end. That’s not what this is. The first part of the order only cements the second part of the order, to prevent American criminals from running away to foreign countries and being supported by foreigners.</p>
<p>To sum this up: No swamp critter can accept help from another swamp critter in getting away … Child traffickers and other human rights abuses are covered, the stealing of and misuse of government funds is covered, all items are covered for foreigners and U.S. citizens, any foreigners who have assets in the U.S. that have done anything against the U.S. for the purpose of supporting the American swamp will have those assets seized, anyone in violation of anything in this executive order will have their assets seized… . </p>
</blockquote>
<h1></h1>
<p>Oh Snap! <strong>MegaAnon</strong> spoke!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An anonymous whistleblower using the pseudonym MegaAnon says that the Executive Order has led to many powerful members of the Deep State waking up with no financial resources.</p>
<p>Guess what? The Swamp’s financials FROZE OVER while they all slept last night, y’all.</p>
<p>It’s gonna be a LOOOOOONG Christmas break for them… they were all broke before sunrise …</p>
<p>This covers kids/humans, drugs, arms/guns, WMD’s/chemicals/Uranium, organs, etc.</p>
<p>Now if you want to know who in our swamp woke up with frozen accounts, foundations, “charities”, side businesses and shell orgs/LLC’s, etc. dig into the annex list… </p>
</blockquote>
<h1></h1>
<p>What is particularly noteworthy in the Executive Order is that this transfer of power is being done quietly behind the scenes with little mainstream attention. Key figures in the Deep State are finding their global financial resources frozen, and are being secretly detained via sealed indictments that now have worldwide impact due to Trump’s Executive Order.</p>
<p>By late November, there were over four thousand sealed federal indictments being tracked by alternative news journalists such as Hal Turner. Many of these are being enforced by Special Operations Command personnel that are going around the planet arresting key Deep State figures.</p>

                Yes I lost my GregChism password too. I have a huge problem with remembering passwords. I've had them saved on here and then something weird happens to my computer and I have to reset everything. I'm trying to transfer files now so I can wipe my hard drive and hopefully get my computer back to normal. Hubby tried to clean my computer up for me and now all the cache and saved passwords are gone.

            lots of dweebs larping as lawyers. the EO means any person or agent associated with the individuals/groups on the list can get their money frozen.there's also a line placing ANY perons/group engaging in crimes against humanity under penalty.  that includes US citizens. Its worded simply and clearly. If you're a bad guy, or help bad guys, your shit gets frozen.

            Also, the IRS had claimed that NO ONE could remove them is bullshit!  All the agencies they distributed our taxes to are under this order... they supplied agencies with our TAX dollars ...unbeknownst to all of us ... to support vile and traitorous people to perpetrate pedophiles worldwide... not just wars!  This will end the Fed on all levels!
They are a private company that covertly distributed our tax money to fund pedophilic country in their pedophile, drug running, human atrocities since 1913... they believed they were untouchable... well...
Touch ... touch ... touch... you can’t stop us now... fuckers! MAGA!!!!!

            <p>
             Something very profound happened in the U.S. on December 21 with the passage of President Donald Trump’s “Executive Order
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The article you link to by DR MICHAEL SALLA doesn't understand what is going on here, starting with the idea that an executive order is "passed."  It is not.  Moreover this executive order owes its existence to a law that Congress passed last year and was signed by President Obama just about a year ago, the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act
           </p>
           <p>
            The Executive Order makes clear that authority for the President to take this action is based on the US laws including the  Global Magnitsky Act as well as the US Constitution.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA),
             <strong>
              the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (Public Law 114-328)
             </strong>
             ......
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The FAQ on the this executive order makes clear that the order only applies to the Magnitsky Act.  It's the official implementation of the act.  Basically you need an executive order for the sanctions to happen and the only person to issue an executive order is the president.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The E.O. implements the Global Magnitsky Act, which is a statutory authority targeting human
rights abusers and corrupt actors globally

           </p>
           <p>
            In order to understand what can happen under the executive order you have read the law itself.  It's under
Subtitle F—Human Rights Sanctions
            <a href="https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ328/PLAW-114publ328.pdf">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            When you go and read the actual law you it applies to "foreign persons" and there's a whole section on INADMISSIBILITY TO UNITED STATES including the emergency section.
           </p>
           <p>
            Which makes this claim from Salla just a load of hooey.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             While the mainstream media has largely ignored Trump’s Executive Order, the alternative media has been paying close attention. Many have noted the Executive Order is far more significant than what it appears to be on the surface. Rather than just freezing the financial resources of foreign citizens linked to the Russian sphere of influence, as it superficially appears to do, it is really targeted at members of the “Deep State” (aka Cabal or Illuminati)  that have been involved in human trafficking, pedophilia and systemic corruption all over the planet.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The mainstream media got this right.   This order is implementing the Global Magnisky Act.   The MSM also did not make this mistake that Salla does: " foreign citizens linked to the Russian sphere of influence."   He's completely wrong on this.  I think he just googled Magnitsky Act and doesn't understand there is a 2012 law that applies to Russia and this 2016 law that is "Global"  which is why it's the GLOBAL MAGNITSKY ACT.  The journalist he quotes has it completely wrong.  In fact, it's just a fantasy.
           </p>
           <p>
            So what's the deal with declaration of a National Emergency?   It has to do with this law which is the original law that allows a president to seize foreign assets.  The new Magnitsky Act is an expansion of this law, I believe.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), Title II of Pub.L. 95–223, 91 Stat. 1626, enacted October 28, 1977, is a United States federal law authorizing the President to regulate commerce after declaring a national emergency in response to any unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States which has a foreign source.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So to implement a law passed by Congress last year, the executive has to declare a state of emergency.   However that is a limited state of emergency just as the sanctions are limited to foreigners and limited to the named people or entities.  The President cannot unilaterally decide who goes on the list.

             Actually the pres can do whatever he wants under this act and Congress and judicial system can sort it out later. (You know, like locking up the Japs.) They'll have a heck of a time doing that tho when they find themselves indicted under the very act they helped pass. K?

              No.  No he cannot.   No matter how much people are hoping that this gives Trump dictatorial powers, this law doesn't do that.

              I was once at a concert when a guy asked to if he could step in front of me to take some photos.  2 minutes later, I was about to shove the guy backwards, when I noticed it was the photographer who took these photos.  So I let him keep the spot all night.

               The law doesn't matter. They break the law and are above the law. This conversation has turned silly on both sides. The law matters for us, and those they want to target. That is is.

                I recognized him.   A few years earlier I walked into a bar and his photos were on all the walls and about an hour later he showed up.  He was having his birthday party there.

                I saw Link Wray, Rockabilly Original, the original King of the Power Chord, the inventor of the fuzztone.  Fantastic show.  He had some young guys backing him up and he was blasting away like a teenager at age 74.  A couple members of the E Street band joined in at one point.  He had a big hit with Rumble and was supposedly the first to poke holes in his amplifier to create distortion and feedback.  He was big influence on all the loud British bands of the 60's.

                 Okay I looked up Link Ray. Now I know who he is, he was w/ Quicksilver Messenger Service. I was in LA when he was playing at Whiskey A Go Go but I never saw him. I went out there to see Rodney Bingenheimer. Rockabilly I know, but this guy I can't say I remember him. I played bass and rhythm in a flunky band back then.

                 Now if you don't tell me why you're here all the time I cannot speak w/ you. And you do remember me as the guy who talked to you about Willie Nelson surely.

                  I do remember talking about Willie Nelson, but I often don't look at the names just the posts.   I might have you confused with someone else, but are you the guy whose church is the same as Trump's mother?
                 </p>

                  I think I got into Link Wray through surf music.  There was surf revival a few years ago and I was into that for a bit.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I here because I find this fasicnating.   There's not a single bit of the original claims about pizzagate that stands up but people still cling to them.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I have a couple of theories and I want to see if they pan out.  One is that pizzagate was not organic.  It wasn't just folks on reddit and 4 chan investigated and came up with stuff.  It was seeded, it was planted.  I believe the folks who had Podesta's emails before they were released, looked to see what they could distort. And they knew what the online crowd would run with. There's no way you could believe Hillary Clinton was following Laura Silsby from 2001 when your evidence is a document that was obviously written in 2010.  That's not a honest mistake, that's an attempt to deceive.  Neither is walnut sauce, because if you google that you'll find tons of recipes for the actual dish.  Hell, before pizzagate broke there's video of John Podesta cooking it on the web as well as his recipe.  In fact the emails talking about walnut sauce were in reference to an article, in I believe Politico, where the Clinton campaign had a meet and greet for political reporters and John Podesta served that.  I get that people who don't bump into Bob Gruen at concerts might be freaked out by provocative art like Ambramovic or Djurdjevic, but these are well known artists with lots of folks who respond to their stuff. So to see the myths being woven about them is fascinating. In fact, I think Djurdjevic is coming from a place much closer to the pizzagaters that most understand.  I think her art is so disturbing because she is accusing the viewer.  Her work is about violence, but she is not celebrating it, she's asking her audience, how could you let this happen.  The defining moments of her life was the break up of Yugoslavia and the horrors of the Yugoslav Wars including genocide.  She was very close to the age of the subjects in her paintings when Milošević came to power.  Her point of view is that of her subjects.   She identifies with the children in her paintings.  She like them is accusing you, how could you let this happen.

                  Also I'm pretty sure the handkerchief is a towel and that $65,000 hot dog guy hated Obama and his gossip reflected that.

                   Yes, the one from Trump's mom's church, Isle of Lewis, Scotland. Same guy that talked to you about Willie Nelson. Any govt. official stories that you believe are shams and lies?

                   Jan and Dean were making a "comeback" due to that short lived surf music revival but Jan died shortly after it fizzled due to his old car crash injuries.

                   You are "normalizing" twisted behavior by attaching the word "art," as is done w/ Warhol's "emperor has no clothes" garbage that sells for foolish sums. He's a loser. People make gods of Dylan and Clapton and Hendrix and Joplin, immensely over-rated but it's cool, it's nostalgic, it's a sense of immortal well-being there.

                   I agree about Djurdjevic.

            Another rehash of already posted speculation.  Where would we be without you? Oh right, making progress instead of gossiping.  Women are even in the pubs now invading traditional male safe spaces.  We need a CAPCHA type thing to enter the sub with some algebra

            I'm surprised that you all are just noticing this and there is one little crumb missing from your post. The EO doesn't just deal with individuals, it can also freeze the assets of entire companies MERELY FOR EMPLOYING a child trafficker.

           <p>
            Follow the trail of CEOs who just quit, there were a lot of them.

            </a>
            has been having a worldwide effect and in a wholly good way.
           </p>
           <p>
            One suggestion that I can give is that if one of you goats can throw together the info about the ownership of the block where Besta is (from the archives) it would really help out the the guys over at infinity chan CBTS, they are trying to ty SA into the trafficking ring.
           </p>
           <p>
            You all have been doing the Lord's work over here and it has been noticed. You are literally saving children, please don't stop.

             This is  probably the most informative Voat research on the Besta block ownership.  There is disagreement about Saudi v. Jewish interests in the property:
