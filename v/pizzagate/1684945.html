<p>5150 (Involuntary Psychiatric Hold) - which authorizes a qualified officer or clinician to involuntarily confine a person suspected to have a mental disorder that makes them a danger to themselves, a danger to others, and/or gravely disabled. A qualified officer, which includes any California peace officer, as well as any specifically-designated county clinician, can request the confinement after signing a written declaration stating the psychiatric diagnosis that the diagnosing medical professional believes to be the cause or reason why they believe the patient to be &quot;a danger to themselves or others&quot;</p>
<p>Let\'s begin with facts so as not to lose our more &quot;closed minded individuals&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Celebrities that have had some sort of a falling off or a mental break-</strong></p>
<p>-Kanye West
-Amanda Bynes
-Brittany Spears
-Michael Jackson
-Many others I am sure I have missed...</p>
<p>So we can all agree these people suffered a largely publicized mental break down right? Great! Moving on...</p>
<p><strong>Kanye West-</strong> (Where to even begin...)</p>
<p>If the bizarre reality that is his life isn\'t enough of a red flag (How are Kanye, Kim, and Caitlyn/Bruce all family lol) then let\'s examine the facts again.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kanye had his infamous &quot;Life of Pablo&quot; rant on 11/19/16 in which he supported trump and called out Mark Zuckerberg, Jay-Z, and Beyonce. (also begged Jay-s not to send &quot;Killaz&quot; at his head)</li>
</ul>
<p>-In the following days Kanye is placed on 5150 hold at UCLA Medical Center for 9 days.</p>
<p>-Following his release he suffers memory loss some have called &quot;Retrograde Amnesia&quot;

<p>-Also worth noting he met with Donald Trump after...? I\'ve no clue what to make of this...

<p><strong>Amanda Bynes-</strong>
-Has mental break down and Tweets of Microchipping, Family incest, her fathers abuse, and not being brainwashed anymore. Her Tweets can be found in this article (which also touches on a point im trying to make) <a href="https://vigilantcitizen.com/latestnews/amanda-bynes-tweets-fathers-abuse-microchip-brain-now-involontary-psychiatric-hold/">https://vigilantcitizen.com/latestnews/amanda-bynes-tweets-fathers-abuse-microchip-brain-now-involontary-psychiatric-hold/</a></p>

<p><strong>Brittany Spears-</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Noted Mental break down... ...Three weeks later Spears was committed to the psychiatric ward of Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and...  ...placed on a 5150 involuntary psychiatric hold for 72 hours. <a href="http://people.com/celebrity/britney-spears-hospitalized-again-for-evaluation/">http://people.com/celebrity/britney-spears-hospitalized-again-for-evaluation/</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>-Michael Jackson</strong> (Leads here I believe)</p>
<p>-We all know the story about Michael Jackson. (I personally believe him to not be a pedophile and to have been framed and Neverland RAnch to be a CIA programming site but don\'t let me lose you yet!)</p>
<p>-Clip of MJ talking about the corruption in Sony on 6/15/2002 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=835XSTScxUw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=835XSTScxUw</a></p>

(maybe he should not have talked shit on Sony?)</p>
<p>-Also worth noting his supposed daughter Paris Jackson was commited to UCLA medical Center for 72 hours following a suicide attempt

<p>So, I thought man that sure is a weird coincidence that all the big mental break celebrities have ended up at UCLA Medical Center. Hey! Maybe it is because celebrities typically come from California and UCLA is there, surely that is why! But I decided to do a little more digging for shits and gigs ya know? </p>
<p>Moving on to my next little find...</p>
<p><strong>Louis J. West, M.D.</strong></p>
<p>-(deceased) was Professor of Psychiatry at UCLA’s Neuropsychiatric Institute, of which he was the director for many years.</p>
<p>-Psychiatrist Louis Jolyon West, an expert on cults, torture and brainwashing.</p>
<p>-West frequently worked as a <em>court-appointed psychiatrist</em>. After examining Ruby, the killer of President John F. Kennedy\'s assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>
<p>-During the Korean War he studied brainwashing and torture.</p>
<p>-In a document released under the Freedom of Information Act, for example, it was revealed that more than four decades ago, the CIA sought to set West up in a clandestine laboratory to perform “mind-control” experiments with hypnosis and LSD. A portion of the experiments with LSD and other drugs in which West was enmeshed at the CIA’s behest were exposed in the mid-1970s by the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, chaired by Senator Frank Church.</p>
<ul>
<li>West’s career highlights included injecting a 7,000-pound bull elephant, Tusko, with an overwhelming dose of LSD — roughly 1,435 times the quantity, in West’s own words, one would have given to a human “to produce for several hours a marked mental disturbance.” Not surprisingly, the elephant collapsed in agony minutes later and died.</li>
</ul>
<p>-It was reported in 1976, for example, that Neuropsychiatric Institute psychiatrist Ivar Lovass had used electric cattle prods for “aversion therapy” on children.</p>

<p><strong>Okay so what?!?!</strong>
I guess I am just asking for help to continue to map out this crazy world we live in. Clearly there is a connection to PG through SRA. DR. West can be linked as working with the CIA and the MKultra program out of UCLA medical center. It just so happens that celebrities that have mental break downs of sorta all end up at UCLA medical center. Some of the celebrities have taken a somewhat &quot;anti-NWO&quot; approach or speech or something of the sort. (Can\'t have people with such big following speaking the truth now can we?) Most of the time end up involuntarily at UCLA medical center where they are kept for DAYS. The same center that was known for LSD use and Electroshock therapy. (no evidence i can find beyond speculation this goes on today but cmon now...) The celebrities leave with memory problems? <em>I need your help making the connections.</em> They do have an interesting Adoption section of the medical center I will be looking into shortly. Also I think i may have found a way to connect this to HRC, will update as I find more.</p>

            I just want to say, watch the video of Trump and Kanye again. Tell me that Kanye doesn't look like a kindergartner who just tattled about all the bad kids plan. I honestly think he knows and hinted Trump in on what he knows. I'm pretty sure Kanye is a good dude.

            Don't forget that this is where Breitbart was taken. Definitely something shady with this place. Maybe Georgetown as well. I know there was a list of like 80 schools involved in MKultra type stuff released in like the 70's.

            My grandmother underwent ECT (by choice) back in the early 90's for depression. Told me later it affected her memory. It sounded so horrific to me that she would voluntarily put herself through that that I didn't ask her questions. Now I wish I had.

            Don't forget Maria Carey. She broke down in a hotel. In earlier daze it was Barbara Mandrel who was in hospital from a head on car collision. They kept a guard outside her door. While out of it she was babbling. State secrets. They had to wait till she came out of it to be able to reprogram her. Comas ruin it. Back when they were moving the cocaine through the Grand Ole Oprey. Cathy O'Brian writes about this. Robert Byrd backstage and a young Bill Clinton.

              Yes, I've seen both sides. She's a victim because she chose to live with them or what? If they're big evil plan is to gather a cult of one person, it's kind of a drop in the bucket. On the other hand, their information seems pretty solid. Cathy was really genitally mutilated, and a lot of the information checks out with some other sources. I suspect there may have been a number of attempts to discredit them, or it could be genuine family drama.

                I know.  I know some of the really deep stuff, but I also know that I am going to be sitting down for a few days when it all comes out and get it straight in my head.  I can say this.  I am glad I already know what I know, I hope I am at least half way there.  We will all have to get ready to be let down a lot about people we looked up to.  Big Time.

                 I definitely don't know either, and i wasn't undermining your know, I probably came of pretentious, my mistake. I would think most VOATers will be able to survive when the shit hits the fan. I more so meant the sheepies!

                  Yeah, I commented about Tom Hanks and his skit on Jimmy Kimmel about grooming a little girl to be like Jon Benet and showing her how to be a Sexy Baby and Walk Sexy, etc.  It was really sick.  Kimmel and Ron Howard were also in it with their daughters.  The catch is that it was not Hanks' daughter.  It really shocked me.  Another red pill moment about all 3 of them.
Someone replied, TOM HANKS? Then OPIE?  Wait until they find out about the Pope and the Queen of England, HRC Obama, the Bushes, John Kerry, the list goes on. Sigh.

             Absolutely it is, people think this is just a pedophilia/CP problem. I truly believe it goes much deeper than that. It isn't just sex and pervertedness they are after... They want full blown slaves. I'm not talking slaves in chains, but slaves that likely don't even know they are slaves. And it is all right under our noses!

             That Britney clip has always been freaky to me. A good find for sure, but that PDF is what really intrigued me... i have just started on it but it brings the Mormons into the picture. They have underground tunnels ALL OVER THE PLACE HERE. I want to know what they are up to...

             LYRICS TO KANYE'S "DARK FANTASY"
            </p>
            <p>
             [Intro: Nicki Minaj]
You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven’t, the real one's far too mean
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful, blasted boring
Twisted fictions, sick addictions
Well, gather 'round children, zip it, listen
            </p>
            <p>
             [Hook: Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
            </p>
            <p>
             [Verse 1]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
"You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?"
(You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow
            </p>
            <p>
             [Hook: Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
            </p>
            <p>
             [Verse 2]
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise
            </p>
            <p>
             [Hook: Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
            </p>
            <p>
             [Bridge: Bon Iver &amp; Kanye West]
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
(I saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris
            </p>

            Consider the possibility Kanye West was subjected to ECT Electro Convulsive Therapy.

             I absolutely think this is what happened. One of the ways to cause retrograde amnesia, no?

              Yes. Amnesia during the time ECT is given plus some retrograde amnesia.  I wondered if it was given.  The health care providers know if it was given.  Let them rot in hell if it wasn't " necessary"
