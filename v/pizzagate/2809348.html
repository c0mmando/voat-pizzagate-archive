<p>Longtime Lurker, NOMO CHOMO here (Some may know me from another forum as &quot;S.I.N.&quot;). In this series of posts, I\'ll be exploring &quot;The Order of AHEPA.&quot; I believe this organization is vital to the &quot;Pizzagate&quot; investigation (beyond direct ties to ALEFANTIS family) as it provides vital context into the history of child trafficking in the USA.</p>
<p>VAMPIRES of AHEPA a Case Study in “Charitable” Child Trafficking</p>
<p>The modern refugee crisis is a manufactured event. It follows a long line of [CIA, Deepstate, 5 eyes, British Crown, Council of 300, Vatican, Zionist (insert your favorite conspiratorial elite hierarchy here)]  sponsored destabilization efforts, which create “orphan” or “refugee” children. These separate organizations sometimes work in tandem, and and other times compete, in worldwide destabilization/pillaging efforts. </p>
<p>The order of AHEPA is a Greek-American, Masonic, CIA sponsored, organization that kidnapped, imported, and sold Greek children internationally for 40+ years. (Part 2 <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2809360">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2809360</a>) (Part 3 <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2809365">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2809365</a>)</p>
<p>During the “Greek Orphan Crisis” the Displaced Person’s Act redefined “Orphan” from a child with no parents, to 1 parent, to 2 parents (who are “incapable” of providing care to their children). This forms the “legal” basis for how children are acquired and trafficked, even today.  (Part 4 <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2809501">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2809501</a>)</p>
<p>Under the guise of charity, AHEPA systematized a “rat-line” from Greece to the US and Canada. By funding and building hospitals and orphanages, kidnapping babies under the guise of “stillbirth”, forging birth certificates, and charging exorbitant “placement fees,” they created a child trafficking apparatus (with the support of the US GOVERNMENT) that still operates today.

<p>Part 1: Alefantis family ties to AHEPA</p>
<p>James Achilles Alefantis is the son of Louis “Lee” Achilles Alefantis. James’ grandmother was Helen Rapas Alefantis. Her obituary used to be online @ <a href="https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/helen-alefantis-obituary?pid=87763024">https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/helen-alefantis-obituary?pid=87763024</a> (archived proof <a href="https://voat.co/u/http">@http</a>://archive.is/fvNo5) It listed her as a member of the Daughters of Penelope. </p>
<p>Though <em>someone</em> deleted the obituary, a tribute comments that Helen rose to prominence in the Daughters of Penelope/AHEPA (the women’s order of AHEPA) &amp; “Lee” Alefantis “participated” in the Sons of Pericles (the young men’s order of AHEPA).  “Young” is a relative term, as the order extended membership to age 27 (and sometimes past that for leadership positions).</p>
<pre><code>“George and Lee and families. My sister Helen Pullman and I wish to extend our sympathies on the passing of your mom Helen. We have all enjoyed knowing her and of course, your Dad (was somewhat of a relative or...) for oh so many many years. Family ties, church ties, but especially through the involvement in the Ahepa/Daughters of Penelope circle. Conventions, local activities, and especially, Lee, with your participation with the Sons of Pericles. How proud we all were that you reached that plateau.  know that the happy memories that you all have shared with Helen will keep her  memory alive and the sad times forgotten. And on a side note, Lee, Helen and I are still active in the Daughters down here in Florida which afforded the opportunity to be elected a Grand Governor a few years ago.

<p>Additionally, a “Mrs. Louis Alefantis” is denoted “Buffalo District Governor of Daughters of Penelope” in 1968 (this has never been noted in any prior posts)</p>

             Exactly.  Many talk of the Jews but it goes on in many of the old families of all religions and especially the rich aristocracy.  I don't know if it is true or not but one of the Victims of the cabal said that the father of GHWB raped him until the father died.  It is all about the power over the other person many times not 'just sexual gratification.   It is really a hateful act.

            Heh, conveniently located near the busiest airport in the world. The lease for the Atlanta airport was signed just 3 years after the founding of AHEPA. No surprise here.

            Hi
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/NOMOCHOMO">

            thanks for posting. Have you seen our rules in the sidebar? (When on mobile, please switch to desktop view.)
           </p>
           <p>
            We require a link for each claim that is not common knowledge, and the paragraph below contains a couple of those:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The modern refugee crisis is a manufactured event. It follows a long line of [CIA, Deepstate, 5 eyes, British Crown, Council of 300, Vatican, Zionist (insert your favorite conspiratorial elite hierarchy here)] sponsored destabilization efforts, which create “orphan” or “refugee” children. These separate organizations sometimes work in tandem, and and other times compete, in worldwide destabilization/pillaging efforts. During the “Greek Orphan Crisis” the Displaced Person’s Act redefined “Orphan” from a child with no parents, to 1 parent, to 2 parents (who are “incapable” of providing care to their children). This forms the “legal” basis for how children are acquired and trafficked, even today. The order of AHEPA is a Greek-American, Masonic, CIA sponsored, organization that kidnapped, imported, and sold Greek children internationally for 40+ years. Under the guise of charity, AHEPA systematized a “rat-line” from Greece to the US and Canada. By funding and building hospitals and orphanages, kidnapping babies under the guise of “stillbirth”, forging birth certificates, and charging exorbitant “placement fees,” they created a child trafficking apparatus (with the support of the US GOVERNMENT) that still operates today.

            <p>
             online search tools, different phrases, and combing through every result returned no matter how many pages. there is a lot in OCR text from newspaper archive sites
            </p>
            <p>
             Also it helps to use multiple devices, multiple ip addresses, VPN's, etc. I regularly am able to find a relevant search result on pg1 of a search on an unused burner, but it will be pages deep on my dedicated

               I regularly am able to find a relevant search result on pg1 of a search on an unused burner, but it will be pages deep on my dedicated tracked devices.

              See, this is the problem I'm running into. I've never considered using a burner. I just wasn't that inspired, I guess. Your work is great. You've got my almonds activated.

               Search results are filtered depending on the device (under the guise of providing an intuitive experience, device friendly sites might be prioritized) as well as search cookies on user and provider ends.
              </p>
              <p>
               I personally prefer to use an air gapped computer to archive, a "burner" laptop exclusively for posting, and a burner phone/tablet/laptop for research.
              </p>
              <p>
               Beyond getting a wider array of results, by separating each process into a separate device, your behavior is far more difficult to track/augment.
