            If you listen to Nancy schefer on Interviewd by Alex Jones before she died, she lists how much is paid for each type of child.  I.e. Black hair green eyes and so on

             What do you guys think of Alex Jones? I just cannot tolerate listening to his voice, i find it very irritating. I heard he is also a disinfo agent? I am not sure if he is crazy but honest like David Icke or just plain liar.

              I used to be a huge fan. But I noticed the more I listened to him the more I got fearful and hopeless.  Maybe it's just a personal thing.  His cutting off of guests then redirecting the conversation was suspicious and annoying at times.  For example, Max Keiser had great ideas for protests.  Like everyone should sell their coke stock. Since coke is so international and connected to almost every industry, this could send a message if a few "truthers" sell that stock. AJ cut keiser off and said next time we'll talk about it.
             </p>
             <p>
              The late Great Arron Russo told him to shut up and listen in one interview. Arron was all about action and solutions... AJ just wants to keep talking about the rabbit hole. Nancy Shaffer was contacting AJ for weeks about bombshell new info, but then she was murdered.  AJ claimed he was too busy to contact her.

              Think what you want about Icke, but his Moto is "let's stop watching the walls of the prison being built and let's start taking it down brick by brick".

              Bill cooper before he died said if you want to know who is an agent, look at who they allow to live and profit off this stuff.

            This may or may not have any relevance, but during my trafficking while I was forced to travel with a man, he mentioned several times that he took an interest in me because my amber-colored eyes were uncommon and highly sought after. He would often refer to me as his, "Golden Eye," because apparently those with the coppery and gold-tinted eyes meant they were, "God Touched," and very powerful.
           </p>
           <p>
            Although I have tried looking up more superstitious, spiritual, and occult meanings into unusual eye colors to no avail.

            I guess it just depends on the buyer's preferences for the goods they are looking for.

            Well think about pirate story's every ship had a cabin boy, that was the Captains RIGHT of Privilege to have a cabin boy to keep him warm at night, the general reasoning was that little boys didn't get pregnant. That child birth aboard a ship was messy, that the boy had a longer shelf life, with no menstruation.
The point is this stuff was a legitimate NAVAL practice for 100's of years, and still common in Arab world. Hell the greeks said love between man &amp; woman was impossible, that true love only happens between men, and that women were only created to be cows to breed.

            I noticed an eerie traits in a lot of the children we have seen pics of that Alefantis and his friends have been sharing. I was wondering if its me or do all the kids look similar?  Like they could all share similar genes?  They all seem Caucasian with light coloured hair,  green or blue eyes etc.

             One of the most interesting recent story's on this is the CASTRO case, the guy that kidnapped local girls and kept them in his basement and walked them in back yard on all fours on leashes, had many visitors and told everybody his home was a CIA safe-house, police visited many times and did nothing, same MO blond girls. Eventually a neighbor kicked in the door rescued the girls, later the FBI burned the house down and CASTRO was murdered his first days in jail.

              Yeah there must be some sort of grading they use to classify the kids.  They probably just consider them to be livestock for trading. Makes my blood boil.
