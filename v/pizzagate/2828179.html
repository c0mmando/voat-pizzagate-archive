            I am crying.  Sr. Norma Pimentel where is that Baby?  You Bleeping Witch.  Also, Hillary sat on the board of Walmart in the 80's I believe.  What and how is she connected now?  We have long believed that Walmart centers are holding Trafficked Children.  We researched these centers, the closed ones.  There was a list of them.  There was an old thread I remember it.  This is So Ugly.  Notice the mention of Ark. &amp; Texas.  Ark./Clintons     Texas/Bushes.  LOL.  What a Bleeping Coincidence.

           <p>
            In 1986, Sam Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart, was under pressure to appoint a woman to the company’s 15-member -all male- board of directors. So, Mr. Walton asked a young lawyer, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who just happened to be married to the governor of Arkansas at the time, where Wal-Mart is based, to be the sole female member of the board.
           </p>
           <p>
            Associated Press reported in 2006 that Mrs. Clinton was paid $18,000 annually plus $1,500 for each meeting she attended as a board member.  The Clintons had $100,000 in Walmart stock, which was put into a blind trust after the 1992 election. The Clintons also flew for free on Wal-Mart corporate planes 14 times in 1990 and 1991, in preparation for Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential bid.
           </p>
           <p>
            The ties between the Clintons and the Walton family continue to this day. Alice Walton, the daughter of Wal-Mart’s founder Sam Walton, is a big supporter of Hillary Clinton becoming the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016. According to filings with the FEC, Alice Walton gave $25,000, the maximum allowed under federal law, to the super PAC Ready for Hillary. According to Clinton Foundation’s disclosures, the Walmart Foundation and the Walton Family Foundation each have given between $1 million and $5 million to the Clinton Foundation.

             Was only a couple of years ago that speculation (real or false) was circulating on the internet of abandoned Wal Marts being turned into detention centers for resisting Americans in the NWO takeover. I never took much heed, as they were all extremely dubious sources, but here we are at present in a close enough scenario. Eerie.

              Eerie, yes.  And true imo.  There are many cos. that are facilitating their trafficking business.  Any lg. cos. that use docks, and have shipping facilities can and do comply.  It's a disgusting thought that people are shopping with them while they are helping traffic Children.

               Somehow I don't think Walt was planning on any of this. If he was compromised into giving Hillary that position, then that explains the selling out part. His girls are probably typical spoiled (extra wealthy) girls with puke lapdog husbands. Funny job resume though. What exactly did you do at the time Hillary? I was a woman leader, who took the money, while attending Satanic witchcraft classes in L.A.

                He raised those greedy witches so he owns some of it. Alice is probably a Satanist herself and the way she dresses I wouldn't be surprised if she is a lesbian like HRC.  These elitists have so much money and strange proclivities because they feel they are above all else and some special being.  They are not one of us, at least in their own minds, They don't want to be. They really make me sick.  There is no way I would give up my life for theirs.  Ever.  Spoiled  Narcissists and Evil.

            This post is a good example of how you self-sabotage.  I've always been nice to you, indeed, exclusively to you, so I am trying to help:

            From the pope's pronouncements and African feet-washing everyone knows the Church is pro-mass immigration from the global south northward, and normies are justifiably upset.
           </p>
           <p>
            But normies will ascribe the Church's position to simple stimulating of supply (of Catholics, i.e. Hispanics) to compensate for what the white Global North destination countries no longer demand (the churches of Europe are now empty museums) -- not to a cabal agenda because you don't explain the subversion of the Church (WHO and HOW these radical shifts took God out of cultural-Catholics' lives).
           </p>
           <p>
            For ex. legalization of abortion was a Jewish psyop admitted as such a Jew founder of the movement who later changed sides (Dr. Bernard Nathanson):
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             'We fed the public a line of deceit, dishonesty, a fabrication of
statistics and figures. We succeeded [in breaking down the laws limiting
abortions] because the time was right and the news media cooperated. We
sensationalized the effects of illegal abortions, and fabricated polls
which indicated that 85% of the public favoured unrestricted abortion,
when we knew it was only 5%. We unashamedly lied, and yet our statements
were quoted [by the media] as though they had been written in law.'
(quoted in John Powell, Abortion: the silent Holocaust. Tabor, Allen,
Texas. 1981.)
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This is why it is frustrating to see countless posts about immigrant grooming gangs or rapists that don't Name

            This is their arrogant concept of "tikkun olam" -- "repairing the world", which was revolutionized by the Kabbalist rabbi Isaac Luria mentioned in this sub (so there's your Pizzagate connection).

           <p>
            ^Everyone knows global south-north immigration is economic in nature; so even if gatekeepers like Q mention Israel starting Syrian war to destabilize Europe with millions of migrants, they'd rather have you research "political and corporate agendas" who have Gentile front-men.

           <p>

            literally claiming the immigrants are meant to act as child-sex-slave recruiters for the "elite" LOL!
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no basis to believe MASS immigration is related to pizzagate itself since the 'cabal's' necessary supply is far more limited.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rather, mass immigration is demonstrably a JEWISH agenda accomplished BY MEANS OF pizzagate blackmail, media sexualization of children, etc.

            All your posts are forgotten and your time wasted because you don't attack the root of the matter, presumably because you're a woman and thus have an innate cowardly fear of social opprobrium.  "One teenage boy is missing from a Catholic shelter", big fucking shit dude.

            Yup, had the exact same reaction when I saw it, but didn't feel like posting here. Why bother with these mods? But I'm glad you did. It's an important lead.

            The church should be investigated. In fact, any church on the list that takes in children should be. Pizzagate has already made a solid connection between children's charities and child trafficking. It doesn't mean every single one on the list is automatically guilty, only that they are in a position to take advantage of the situation. That alone means the deserve a look see.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the other part is investigating these campaign workers and Beta O'Rourke himself. The fact that they were ll tuned in to this ''charity'' and also involved in politics is concerning, especially given what we know. Sort of proves that this is an agenda and everybody is aboard the same caravan.

             Those campaign workers broke the law.  I also think, they are useful idiots as far as the globalist agenda is concerned.  They are too stupid to understand what is really going on. I couldn't even finish listening to the video because of the incoherency in their [lack of] command of the English language. Pathetic.

              But useful idiots are what is keeping this human trafficking train on the tracks.
             </p>
             <p>
              Useful idiots are the ones fighting for open borders and birthright citizenship and everyone woman should be believed unless they're accusing a dem candidate. And who else but a useful idiot would be running a woman off the road for having a bumper sticker, or throwing coffee while shouting, ''THEY'RE SHOOTING MY PEOPLE!'', or ripping up campaign signs.

              I really wish some indie journalist goes undercover to find out what that mass repeating of words is about. Sure looked like a cult indoctrination. Mindlessly repeating someone's words shuts down critical thinking and removes identity. I would like someone to film and find out more about this. And one more point, the targeting and recruitment of misfits is crucial. The dems excel at it. You get someone that isn't that bright and pretty useless and present them an opportunity to plug into power, and you've got yourself a Democrat screaming at the sky.

               That comes from the Occupy movement.  During Occupy Wall Street when the crowds of protesters were very large and there were no megaphones so that speakers could be heard at the back of the crowd, the people at the front would repeat the first sentences of the speaker and then people behind them would repeat it and so on until the message got to the back. Like a Mexican Wave.  However, that technique has now devolved into the numpty, mindless repeating of words by the clueless useful idiots.  Now it's like a form of mind control.

                Remember, they used NXIVM and had Jim Jones before that. There were also other various cults so I suspect they knew this was a form of mind control. I came across interesting research concerning a well-known cult, but don't even feel like posting anymore. I suppose it's spiteful, but why bother when all I do is get harassed? So instead, I read posts and offer support, ideas, or suggestions to motivate others.

            I think it's worth going through this entire list at some point.

           <blockquote>

             Here’s a list of organizations that are mobilizing to help immigrant children separated from their families -

           <p>
            But for now, another example:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Kids In Need of Defense
             </strong>
             partners with major law firms, corporations and bar associations to create a nationwide pro bono network to represent unaccompanied children through their immigration proceedings. Volunteers don’t need to have immigration law experience.

             Big Lead: (Long) Central America, the 2014/2015 Undocumented Minors Crisis and the Clinton Foundation
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Bullet Point Facts:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              The Clinton Foundation was involved in destabilizing Central American governments
             </li>
             <li>
              Destabilized Central American nations experienced a surge in Drug Cartel violence and human trafficking reports
             </li>
             <li>
              Children have been smuggled into the U.S. as "refugees" from these countries as a direct result of Clinton policies
             </li>
             <li>
              Over 47,000 undocumented children have gone missing after arriving in the U.S.
             </li>
             <li>
              Undocumented children have been secretly "released" off the record to private sponsors and caretakers
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             I worked for an immigration law firm at one point and spent a large amount of time researching the undocumented minors crisis in 2014/2015, if anybody remembers this. At the time, it just seemed like another organic immigration issue similar to all of the others. Upon investigation, this is most likely far from the case.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are remarkable parallels to Haiti, and even more concerning, Clinton Foundation involvement in manufacturing a crisis that drove children in hordes to the U.S. border for "refuge." Turns out this is still ongoing and actually has gotten worse despite the MSM dropping the subject from the news.
            </p>
            <p>
             The CIA has been involved in countless Latin American and Central American civil wars in the 20th century behind the scenes. These were done to intentionally destabilize the region for political and corporate agendas.
            </p>
            <p>
             These kids are smuggled across borders for large sums of cash extorted from poor Central American families. Part of this boom in industry is due to a major narrative being pushed in Central America that the U.S. was "taking in all undocumented children" as refugees and that anybody that could afford to get their children out of places like Honduras, should ASAP. There are numerous non-profits and groups devoted to "handling" these children like Casa Cornelia and Kids in Need of Defense (KIND).

             Her foundation, together with Brad Pitt is called KIND = Kids In Need of Defense Look at this partner list. It reads like The Who is who of the corporate world.

             The drug wars are Machiavellian in nature and the winner is pre planned. Khazarian mafia are controlling the drug trade more than ever. They take no real risk as drug dealer, informant, undercover, cop, prosecuting/defense attorney, Sheriff, and Judge. They just use the cartels as couriers. Used to be just an East Coast problem. Now they have muscled over to West Florida.
