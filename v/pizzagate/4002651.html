<p>CARGO COLLECTIVE</p>
<p>From my quick look, CARGO COLLECTIVE is a sign-in web hosting company and blog involved in some pretty weird stuff. They use shipping lingo, have some consistencies to our research, and are tied to James Alefantis so I believed this Pizzagate worthy. I am not sure what (if anything) I\'ve found but this potential new lead has a lot to dig. THANK YOU!</p>

<p>For DOLLY / PETER (2018) Hawk Swanson sculpted a replica combining likenesses of two dolphins who lived in captivity in the 1960s and ‘70s—Dolly, who was captive in Floridaland (Sarasota, FL) and Peter, who was captive in the <strong>NASA-funded Dolphin House (St. Thomas, U.S.V.I.)</strong>. Both Dolly and Peter experienced complex sexualized relationships with humans before voluntarily choosing to stop breathing.</p>

<p>And what of ketamine? Well, what of the confident separations of cognitive and material spaces? A few nights ago we had an evening employing much of the stuff with **_______**; a strange session to be sure. The first ingestion induced a reverie of which the intention seemed a compact and warm reinforcement of a roster of mystical symbolism. Window fingerprints catalyzed visions of Pan. Wiggles and knots in the wood ceiling pushed pale, swirling sperm whales. A stain on the cinder block suggested an undulating but qualified <strong>demonic face</strong>. The exhortations were fast and gloomy but always benevolent — there was a general intimation that these myths are wholly real, just not physical, and are to be brought into quotidian life with the same conviction as “Windex” or “school.” There was also music playing; no matter the melody, all moods became aggressively “exotic” — intimations of Marcel Schwob’s story The Embalming Women was in the air; and classical North African clothing in general. The rest of the evening wanted no solitary contemplations; the effects of subsequent sniffs were spent in direct interaction with _______. All chat seemed to ask for a light hearted tearing of conceptual confidence, particularly of the unavoidable tendency towards the psychological domestication of physical space. Following this thought procession, it occurred that it might be fruitfully psychotic to put on Christopher Young’s beautifully soap operatic soundtrack for Hellraiser. More success! Various oddities ensued — after a particular riff on the bizarreness of family contingencies, we yielded to an urge to crawl (uninvited and quite suddenly) through _______‘s legs. The pull was some sort of need to manifest something like a birth friction!? It was quite a time.

            Acid, ET's and The Order of the Dolphin Facility on St Thomas Island
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             During Christmas 1963, her brother-in-law mentioned a secret laboratory at the eastern end of the island where they were working with dolphins. She decided to pay the lab a visit early the following year. “I was curious,” Lovatt recalls. “I drove out there, down a muddy hill, and at the bottom was a cliff with a big white building.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “Dolphins get sexual urges,” says the vet Andy Williamson, who looked after the animals’ health at Dolphin House. “I’m sure Peter had plenty of thoughts along those lines.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “Peter liked to be with me,” explains Lovatt. “He would rub himself on my knee, or my foot, or my hand. And at first I would put him downstairs with the girls,” she says. But transporting Peter downstairs proved so disruptive to the lessons that, faced with his frequent arousals, it just seemed easier for Lovatt to relieve his urges herself manually.
            </p>
            <p>
             “I allowed that,” she says. “I wasn’t uncomfortable with it, as long as it wasn’t rough. It would just become part of what was going on, like an itch – just get rid of it, scratch it and move on. And that’s how it seemed to work out. It wasn’t private. People could observe it.”
            </p>
            <p>
             For Lovatt it was a precious thing, which was always carried out with great respect. “Peter was right there and he knew that I was right there,” she continues. “It wasn’t sexual on my part. Sensuous perhaps. It seemed to me that it made the bond closer. Not because of the sexual activity, but because of the lack of having to keep breaking. And that’s really all it was. I was there to get to know Peter. That was part of Peter.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Innocent as they were, Lovatt’s sexual encounters with Peter would ultimately overshadow the whole experiment when a story about them appeared in Hustler magazine in the late 1970s. “I’d never even heard of Hustler,” says Lovatt. “I think there were two magazine stores on the island at the time. And I went to one and looked and I found this story with my name and Peter, and a drawing.”

            <p>
             Lovatt bought up all the copies she could find, but the story was out there and continues to circulate to this day on the web. “It’s a bit uncomfortable,” she acknowledges. “The worst experiment in the world, I’ve read somewhere, was me and Peter. That’s fine, I don’t mind. But that was not the point of it, nor the result of it. So I just ignore it.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Something else began to interrupt the study. Lilly had been researching the mind-altering powers of the drug LSD since the early 1960s. The wife of Ivan Tors, the producer of the dolphin movie Flipper, had first introduced him to it at a party in Hollywood. “John and Ivan Tors were really good friends,” says Ric O’Barry of the Dolphin Project (an organisation that aims to stop dolphin slaughter and exploitation around the world) and a friend of Lilly’s at the time. “Ivan was financing some of the work on St Thomas. I saw John go from a scientist with a white coat to a full blown hippy,” he remembers.

             Stoners would actually be a compliment,,, JA's arrogance, combined with his multiple persona's like a  twisted sister hag...  Vile stained seed of the Rothchild's, capable/culpable of the abnormal would be more accurate.

              No. The only other post mentioning this is from
              <a href="https://archive.is/wip/5a3Dx">
               a Donkey alt
              </a>
              , which was probably a ploy to get people to pass on researching it. The strategy being: create a notorious and hated shill account, then use its alts to post research you want to have dismissed.

             <p>
              Looks worth digging into to me.

               LMFAO how does that even make sense, idiot?  You'd post it on the SHILL account not the unknown alts, which defeats the entire purpose.  Jesus Christ your own abject stupidity is a better deterrent to me than your bans.  You're the people who think The Deep State flagged and DDoSd a thread they wanted to BURY; your expertise in "strategy" is as dubious as your sexuality.

               I'm actually flabbergasted at how far this sub has fallen.  Before your watch it was a dozen research threads a day.  But I'M THE SHILL LOL!

                My accounts have a combined -5000 or so and I'm always right, so upvoats are stupid.

                For ex another connection to Cargo Collective you should check out is a photographer called Wade Turnbull, whose since-deleted tweets were cited in the DailyKos piece that prompted my Dump Trump post /voat.co/v/pizzagate/1835850

                ..except the author updated it to say:
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Authors Note-The Wade Turnbull I attributed to the Twitter posts was incorrectly identified as an individual with the same name. The Wade Turnbull quoted-who I did not speak with prior to this publication-is the owner of the website Cargo Collective.  My apologies for the error.

                So an insider who worked w Trump Models and  "wasn't a fan of Hillary" provided testimony on Twitter but the MSM chose NOT to take this easy shot at Trump (since his campaign was anti illegal immigration but his agency committed immigration fraud).
               </p>
               <p>
                Hard to imagine it isn't the same Wade Turnbull.  But instead of finding that out just shill this thread which is more pertinent.  voat.co/v/politics/3983713
