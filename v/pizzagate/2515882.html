MSM took no notice of last week\'s federal court filing that exposes an $84 million money-laundering conspiracy that the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign executed during the 2016 presidential election in violation of federal campaign-finance law.</p>
<p>Dan Backer, the on record campaign-finance lawyer explained the campaign-finance law: &quot;an individual donor can contribute $2,700 to any candidate, $10,000 to any state party committee and (during the 2016 cycle) $33,400 to a national party\'s main account.  These groups can all get together and take a single check from a donor for the sum of those contribution limits - it\'s legal because the donor cannot exceed the base limit for any one recipient.  And state parties can make unlimited transfer to their national party.&quot;</p>
<p>The legal loophole allows &quot;bundlers&quot; to raise large sums of money from wealthy donors.  Both Dems and Repubs exploit this tactic.  But once the money reaches the national committees, other limits apply.  Backer filed an 86-page Complaint with the FEC, asking the FEC to commence enforcement proceedings against HRC, her campaign and its treasurer; the DNC and its treasurer, and the participating state Democratic committees.  The Complaint and an attached exhibit consisting of nearly 20 pages of Excel spreadsheets, detailed the misconduct and provided concrete evidence supporting the allegations.</p>
<p>The article states to think of all of this like a shell game with millions of dollars.  According to &quot;Politico,&quot; the evidence is damning - &quot;while state party officials were made aware that Clinton\'s campaign would control the movement of funds between participating committees, one operative who has relationships with multiple state parties said that some of their officials have complained that they weren\'t notified of the transfers into and out of their accounts until after the fact.&quot;</p>
<p>During the 2016 election, HRC, the DNC, and participating-state Democratic committees established the Hillary Victory Fund (HVF) as a joint fundraising committee to accept contributions from large donors, some exceeding $400,000.  Not a problem.  To comply with the law, the HVF needed to transfer these donations to the specified recipients, whether it be the Clinton campaign, down-ticket Democrats, the DNC, or state committees.  This, however, did not happen the way it was supposed to happen.  Several large contributions reported as received by the HVF in the same amount on the same day (once in awhile the following day) were recorded as received by the DNC from a state Democratic committee, but WITHOUT the state Democratic committee EVER reporting the contribution.  Over a 13-month period, the FCC records show some 30 occasions when the HVF transferred contributions totaling more than $10 million to the DNC without any corresponding record of the receipt or disbursement from the state parties, thus illegally leap-frogging the state Democratic parties.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of Backer\'s Complaint, the FEC was required to notify those accused of violating federal law of the charges.  Then the commissioners were required to determine whether there was &quot;reason to believe&quot; a violation occurred.  Following a finding by 4 FEC commissioners that there was &quot;reason to believe,&quot; the FEC must investigate the Complaint.</p>
<p>BUT, The FEC did NOTHING other than presumably notify the DNC and Clinton of the charges.  Backer then turned to federal court, seeking to force the FEC to fulfill its statutory duty as provided by federal law.  Specifically, the controlling statute provides that should the FEC fail to act &quot;during the 120-day period beginning on the date the Complaint&quot; is filed,&quot; the aggrieved party &quot;may file a petition with the US District Court for the District of Columbia,&quot; alleging the FEC\'s &quot;failure to act contrary to law, [the court] may direct the Commission to conform with such declaration within 30 days.&quot;</p>
<p>So, why didn\'t the FEC act?  Answer - The FEC is dysfunctional.  As previously stated, a finding of &quot;reason to believe&quot; must be made by 4 commissioners, but the 6-member FEC only has 4 commissioners.  By statute, the commissioners must come from different political parties, and by practice, the Senate confirms newly nominated commssioners in pairs, 1 Dem and 1 Repub.  Dems, however, have yet to name a replacement, holding up the confirmation process and leaving in place for the forseeable future a likely deadlock.</p>
<p>This deadlock, however, COULD prove fatal to HRC and the DNC, because as FEC Vice-Chair Eleen Weintraub explained in her statement: &quot;Fire alarms are sometimes housed in boxes labeled \'Break glass in case of emergency.\'  The Federal Election Campaign Act has such a box: it\'s the provision that allows complainants to sue responders directly when the Federal Election Commission fails to enforce the law itself.  In the 44-year history of the FEC, this provision has never been fully utilized.  Today, I\'m breaking the glass.&quot;</p>
<p>The Clintons and party officials should not be the only ones concerned: every big-time donor in on the scheme and acting with the requisite intent faces criminal prosecutuion. </p>
<p>Once again,the waiting game begins to see if justice will be served.

<p>Other news regarding HRC, was an April 18, 2018 letter signed by 10 members of Congress (led by Rep. Ron DeSantis),  to AG Jeff Sessions, FBI Director Christopher Wray, and Federal Prosecutor John Huber.  This letter asks for investigation and prosecution of potential violations of federal statutes by James Comey, HRC, Loretta Lynch, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, and Lisa Page.

            I have seen variations on this about the Hillary's crimes for years, usually followed by "Lock Her Up!", "She's going down!", "Arrests Imminent!" - and yet, after all is said and done, she skates between the rain drops, deflecting everything with her Kevlar/Teflon composite pantsuit. She must have sooo much dirt on sooo many people that she truly is untouchable. Getting our hopes up is akin to Charlie Brown thinking Lucy isn't going to pull the football at the last second. We're being played- stop falling for it.

            My only question is how large a Bribe the FBI requires make Pay to Play acceptable for all Public Servants?
           </p>
           <p>
            Follow up would be; Does that include local Police protection or must I also bribe the State Police?
           </p>
           <p>
            We can not lock up National Security assets under Civilian Law. This is why we have Martial Law, for all public servants "affected" by, for and under National Security.rules, regulations and The Law.
The FBI in it's serenity is a National Security asset, civilian laws are a conflict of interest at this level of public safety, not to mention the constitution. Then we have laws on the books that gives our President War Powers act for attacks by enemies foreign and domestic.

             That is for the mods to decide, not you.  HRC is pizzagate, and she has committed many crimes.  If she is prosected and found guilty of 1 crime, even if that crime is not related to pizzagate crimes, the rabbit-hole is opened.

            <p>
             MSM took no notice of last week's federal court filing that exposes an $84 million money-laundering conspiracy that the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign executed during the 2016 presidential election in violation of federal campaign-finance law.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            That's because there was no money laundering conspiracy.  All this was known about and argued over in 2015/2016.    If violations occurred, they would violations of election law not, money laundering. And the FEC does not seem to agree with their characterization of what happened.   Since this group is calling it $84 million in money laundering, they are hyping a case that may not even get to trial.  This is a lawsuit used to generate headlines.
           </p>
           <p>
            Have you noticed that the Hillary campaign is not being sued here?
           </p>
           <p>
            Another reason it may not get traction with the media is they gave it as an exclusive to a Fox Columnist.
