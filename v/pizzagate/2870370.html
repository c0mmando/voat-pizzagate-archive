<blockquote>
<p>At  least 1,400 white Dutch girls are sex-trafficked every year by nonwhite “immigrants” from Morocco, Turkey, the Caribbean and Gypsies from Eastern Europe, police in the Netherlands have admitted.</p>
<p>News of the scandal has emerged after a joint peroration between police and “Watch Nederland,” one of the Dutch government’s Department of Social Welfare organizations, the Center against Child Abuse and Human Trafficking (“Centrum tegen Kinderhandel en Mensenhandel”) was reported by the Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad.</p>
<p>The investigation showed that the nonwhites first groom the girls to be their sexual partners, and then film themselves having sex with the girls. The videos are then used as blackmail – if the girl doesn’t agree to become a prostitute, then the video of the girl having sex is released on social media.</p>
<p>Police specialists in human trafficking, Marijke van Overveld and Esmee Huijps, told the Alegemeen Dagblad that the traffickers are “Moroccans, Turks, Antilleans and Roma.”</p>
<p>Immigrants from the Antilles come from the “Netherlands Antilles,” a number of islands in the Caribbean Sea located due north of the South American coast. Most of the nonwhites there are descendants of black slaves imported during the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>
<p>Many of the girls being abused are in the Dutch social care system or come from run down housing estates, which is a situation very similar to that in the UK where nonwhite gangs also engage in the same practice.</p>
<p>It is believed a trafficker can earn up to €800 a day pimping out a Dutch girl, who is usually kept against her will in a suburban apartment, or even in a garden shed. The traffickers use adverts on secret chat groups on social media to bring in new customers.</p>
<p>Recent figures shows that only one out of every ten abused girls receives any help from authorities, and so teachers, doctors and community leaders are being trained to spot the signs of grooming in their local jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The Netherlands has very liberal laws when it comes to sex; the country is famous for its sex tourism and red light districts, and the country has very relaxed attitudes to casual sex amongst teenagers, something which has caused STI rates in the country to soar and puts girls at risk from adults who pose as teenagers.</p>
<p>Laws made it difficult to prosecute grooming gangs in the past, with several high profile cases collapsing because the gangs used legal loopholes to avoid a conviction. However in recent years the laws have been tightened and conviction rates are increasing.</p>
<p>Authorities in the Netherlands are now starting to crackdown on the grooming of girls, with fake ads being placed by anti-trafficking organisations which lure criminals into a trap. They are then arrested by the police and prosecuted.</p>
<p>Police in the Netherlands revealed that the profits from the pimping out of underage girls are used to fund greater criminal operations abroad, and are also used to fund Islamist networks across the world, including the Muslim Brotherhood and Chechen terrorist organizations.</p>

            The Netherlands does not protect its vulnerable girls from being trafficked. Prostitution is decriminalised, and prostitution is just another word for trafficking.  The government has had to buy back building after building in the Red Light district. Prostitution was taken over by gangs of traffickers and drug lords, and the famous tourist area (although why tourists would want to gawk at trafficked girls is beyond me) became derelict and dangerous.

            <p>
             Do you suppose someone in govt is having a change of heart about this area?  And about their policies towards the girls?  If they are buying back buildings it seems someone has realized this was not a good idea.  Hopefully other changes are in store.  I know how the operate there, but I am always hopeful someone is coming to their senses.

               Thank you for that article.  What an eye opener.  I am hoping that when they close down that area that things will improve.  I think people that live there may be getting sick of being know as the "Hooker Country".  I am sure they were led to believe it would be, as the article says, a solution with oversight.  We know that Never Happens.  Now they have men coming from all over and clogging up the area to use and abuse.  Not to mention the trafficking problem.   I am hopeful, but know that it could be another of their fake plans.

                The problem is that the traffickers, the pimps, the brothel owners and George Soros have SO much money to fund and pay for pro-sex industry and prostitution groups and organisations. Lots of them claim to be working in the sex industry, but when you dig to see who funds them it's either Open Society (George Soros) or some other group making money from porn videos or brothels.

             The Netherlands has very liberal laws when it comes to sex; the country is famous for its sex tourism and red light districts, and the country has very relaxed attitudes to casual sex amongst teenagers, something which has caused STI rates in the country to soar and puts girls at risk from adults who pose as teenagers.

                 Is it known disinfo because Esotericshade pushed it? All posts related to blood consumption are "disinfo"? Seems like you let him poison a well and then blame the water.

               We gave Donald Trump many chances to Repent.
              </p>
              <p>
               We provided him with direct evidence of Global Criminal Corruption involving the wealthiest families in the world.
              </p>
              <p>
               We exposed the extreme levels of trafficking, tyranny, abuse, and willful dysfunction pervasive at all levels.
              </p>
              <p>
               We revealed their Agenda and offered many paths for him to do The Right Thing, to serve as a True Man of God.
              </p>
              <h2>
               Trump turned his back on The Truth, and made "The Deal" to endorse The Agenda and The Mark of the Beast with 5G+8K AI development which he called "the 8th Wonder of the World" and "the most incredible thing I've ever seen". He had Kanye West similarly mislead Black Americans with a false narrative about slavery, as they con America and The World into a system of Eternal Enslavement.
              </h2>
              <p>
               Do you think Trump and Kanye know where the highest incarceration rate for black men in the world is?
              </p>
              <p>
               Do you think Trump and Kanye know what Hillary's Model for Community Policing is, and what the result is?
              </p>
              <p>
               Do you think Trump and Kanye know what the most valuable resource in the world is?
              </p>
              <p>
               Do you think Trump knows that Bill and Hillary are also members of the Pilgrims Society?
              </p>
              <p>
               Do you think Trump knows how John McCain and Mitt Romney are connected to the Pilgrims Society?
              </p>
              <p>
               Do you think Trump knows why Paul Ryan and Rahm Emanuel are resigning?

              <p>
               Do you think Trump is going to "lock her up"?

              <p>
               Even if he did push for Hillary's indictment as a sacrifice to appease the public, do you think Trump would ever be able to really drain the swamp?
              </p>
              <p>
               When was the last time you heard Trump talking about locking up the Pilgrims Society?
              </p>
              <p>
               Who did Trump reserve a Front Row Seat for at "The Deal" and why?

            Recent figures shows that only one out of every ten abused girls receives any help from authorities, and so teachers, doctors and community leaders are being trained to spot the signs of grooming in their local jurisdiction.
           </p>
           <p>
            Authorities in the Netherlands are now starting to crackdown on the grooming of girls, with fake ads being placed by anti-trafficking organisations which lure criminals into a trap. They are then arrested by the police and prosecuted.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is good news.  The training of professionals will open eyes and bring in some very needed help.  Changing laws and enforcing them is what is needed also.  Possibly people are getting sick of hearing about these abuses and putting pressure on LE.

             This is SICK.  People need to know about this.  There are young boys that have been brought up by their fathers, uncles and imams to believe this.  Now they are putting this into practice.  HORRID.     Thanks for that link. UpVoat.
