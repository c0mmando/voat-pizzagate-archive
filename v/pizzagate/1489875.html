           So I stumbled across this website "Comhlamh." It appears to be a charity/voluntary organisation in Ireland, what shocked me is the logo at the bottom of the page, its not their main logo....wondered why do they have two in the first place?

           ...... on this page at the very bottom they have a "code of conduct on images and messages" link. If they were that vigilant about the messages they were putting across, to the point where they even made a (really strange) video about how important it was and why they do, then why do they have a pedo symbol as one of their logos?

            Recommend rewriting for investigative standards: Who, what, where, when and why (do I care?)  And link doesn't work.  Also, for future leads, Recommend putting an archived link at the bottom BEFORE you post. (archive.is).  Too many leads disappear very shortly after being posted here.  Thanks.
