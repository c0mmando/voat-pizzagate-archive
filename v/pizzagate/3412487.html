<p>In Hollywood right now is a key person the FBI should be talking to about the activities of not only the pedophile/<em>Jeffrey Epstein</em>, but also the foreign born recruiter/sex trafficker not named Ghislaine.</p>
<p>In Hollywood is an agent. This agent/<em>Ari Emanuel</em> is someone who was an equal partner with the foreign born recruiter/sex trafficker, at least for the office here in Los Angeles. He was in charge of finding the youngest possible girls for &quot;modeling,&quot; and also had them shipped all over the world, including to the pedophile whenever they found someone especially appealing. This agent, who has a very recognizable last name, specialized in Central and South American girls. He frequently traveled to the most fertile yachting grounds with a book of models he and the recruiter/sex trafficker had found and clients could order the &quot;model&quot; of their choosing.</p>
<p>He is involved with a group that has elite members from throughout the world. All of these elite members are men. It is a powerful group of entertainers, celebrities, and political leaders not named The Bohemian Grove. It is a group that has risen almost overnight in its popularity among a select group of men. After meeting the agent, these men are often seen with one of the &quot;models.&quot; So, despite the misfortunes of his former partner, this agent has continued the trail they made together and is branching out even more.</p>
<p>Oh, and this agent has publicly supported the sex trafficker/recruiter and their long partnership. No shame in his game.</p>

            Ari is as big an evil scumbag as his other 2 brothers. Bottom of the barrel. Father still lives and was a practicing doctor 2 years ago. Ari and some other notables such as Oprah met with Bergoglio in Rome last July. Up to no good. There was another blind not too long ago about him and just as disgusting.

               Kish has docks for boats and an International airport. Abu Musa has a small runway and docking, as well as an interesting history. Once controlled by the UK. Since both are presently Iranian, I could see both used in such operations. I would imagine they would be trafficking to wealthy Middle Easterners like Qatar, UAE ect. That would also explain why the USA was described as exaggerating the conflict over the islands rightful territory, as strategic as it is. Not far West is where all the trouble with drones and mines on ships took place.

                  It seems to me that they run interference but the actual trafficking is done by the CIA/MOSSAD. This is just my opinion though.

                          Oh that's what you meant?? Because I have plenty of comments on different threads. As far as I know I can't post a submission until I have 100 upvotes so that's why I haven't yet.

                                I already said I didn't have enough points to make a submission and that it wasn't my fault that my top voted comments where shitposts. If anything that suggests that people upvote stupid shit regardless of the content of the post. The future is not written in stone Crensch I might yet make a valuable submission. . . perhaps the most important one yet?? o_O;
