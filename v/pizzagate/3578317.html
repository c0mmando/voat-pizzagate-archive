<p>I\'ll run through a quick bio of Michael Capponi. Born in <strong>Belgium</strong> in 1972, moved to Miami when he was young, became a <strong>club promoter</strong> when he was <strong>15/16</strong> in the late 80s handing out flyers and <strong>setting up private parties</strong>. Stop. Why is any nightclub hiring an underage teenage to work for them and have such responsibilities. Something is very off about Capponi\'s childhood. Capponi has claimed to have been making <strong>$10,000 a month</strong> while still at high school. No club promoter makes that. So how does he pluck that figure out? Where was that money coming from?</p>
<p>I\'m getting these details from this positive hero worship article by the Miami Herald:</p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/article1938236.html">https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/article1938236.html</a>(<a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/article1938236.html">https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/article1938236.html</a>)</p>
<p>This article explains how Capponi ended up a <strong>homeless drug addict on the streets of New York in the winter 1995</strong>. He then went to Belgium to get better but ended up in a coma for three months, then went to Canada for more R&amp;R. Once better he then returned to Miami. What this article fails to mention is that just 4 years after the lowest point in his life his life he was being asked to invest in a new nightclub and for some bizarre reason had decided to go do humanitarian work in the Kosovo crisis of 1999.</p>
<p>This suggests that Capponi very quickly landed on his feet and was once again a name to be scene with in the club world.</p>
<p>But this article is very confusing and suggests Michael Capponi is lying about his age. It says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A friend persuaded him to invest in Coconut Grove’s Mayfair development in the early 80s. The project failed and Capponi’s parents divorced. Capponi ran away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Mayfair in Coconut Grove was built in 1985. Capponi would\'ve been 13. The project didn\'t fail. It\'s a popular place still to this day. So what the hell are they talking about? Did they get the year wrong and mean the early 90s? Well that wouldn\'t make any sense because Michael would\'ve been 23 and they then say this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He later returned to live with his mother in Key Biscayne, but soon began to run wild with the local kids, the ‘Key Rats’. He recalls slipping out his bedroom window aged 13 to spend nights with his friends in Crandon Park taking LSD and listening to The Doors and Led Zeppelin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So he returned home after running away and then began hanging out with the local kids doing drugs at 13. But this was early 90s when he would\'ve been in his 20s? Or was it in the 80s when he would\'ve been 13? But then why would he at 13 be investing in hotel properties at that age? Can you see how confusing his timeline is?</p>
<p>Another thing this article mentions which is very important is that back in Europe his father and grandfather were famous nightclub owners. So its in his blood.</p>
<p>But why is his work in Kosovo important, which the Miami Herald and even his Wiki page fail to mention, to PG? Because of this: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/qPxrwmX">Kosovo were involved in human trafficking and linked to the Clintons</a></p>
<p>Now this was around the same time, 1999, when he was looking into partnering up with Oliver Hoyos, an Austrian count, relative of a line of wealthy bankers, who was running a Greek themed club with beds. So he was still active in the club industry.</p>
<p>So Oliver Hoyos, European nobility, relative of wealthy bankers. Joins forces with Michael Capponi. Why? Because the name Capponi is part of the <strong>Italian Black nobility mafia</strong>. Look up <strong>Gino Capponi</strong> from the 1800s. He was a <strong>Knight of the Order of Saint Joseph</strong>. Well guess who is a council member for the Miami St. Joseph church in Miami beach? <strong>Danoushka Capponi</strong> - Michael Capponi\'s mother. Michael Capponi and his mother may very well be members of the Italian Black Mafia. Who has now joined up with a descendant a elite bankers, European count, to do business. Ask yourselves, do you trust these two people with their backgrounds to be doing honest work?</p>
<p>Little Pizzagate reference. Oliver Hoyos now runs a burger restaurant in Germany called Burger Baby. Sick. So blatant.</p>
<p>Back to Michael Capponi and his mother Danoushka Capponi. She works for his <strong>Global Empowerment Mission</strong> company. Guess who also works with them? Bethenny Frankel. The reality TV star. Frankel is very interesting for a couple of reasons. One is that her father and stepfather were successful horse trainers. Now that is an industry full of corruption. Horses, cash, gambling. Big time money laundering stuff. The second thing that\'s interesting about Bethenny Frankel is her late boyfriend Dennis Shields was a financier who lived in Trump Towers and died of an overdose.</p>
<p>So Frankel. Likely had mobster father and stepfather, dated a &quot;financier&quot; now deceased, and works with Michael Capponi of the famous Capponi family of the Black nobility mafia. Does this at all sound like Frankel enjoys keeping close to a certain kind of person?</p>
<p>So all these serious connections, the strange timeline, the sudden change in job industry,. And here\'s what gets me about these peoples biographies. Same goes for one of Capponi\'s good friend Moishe Mana who claims to have come from Israel to America and became a billionaire. It\'s always this bizarre rags to riches story with these people. Like its almost magical. \'Yeah I was drug addict homeless and then a couple of years later I was running nightclubs with A list celebrities\' I don\'t buy it. </p>
<p>So what is Michael Capponi\'s true position? He always has this Epstein &quot;I know more than you&quot; smile in his photos. Could he be using his charity to steal children? Could he be the new Epstein?</p>',

            Our main objectives were to provide educational Christmas gifts such as laptops and smart phones to our students. I was so happy to see how my love and partner was with these children. The Love that Zoë gives to others is the essence of her being.

            Looks like the clubs hired him because he was a popular teen celebrity at the time, a BMX bike state champ who starred in a couple of television ads:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             He later returned to live with his mother in Key Biscayne, but soon began to run wild with the local kids, the ‘Key Rats’. He recalls slipping out his bedroom window aged 13 to spend nights with his friends in Crandon Park taking LSD and listening to The Doors and Led Zeppelin.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              A BMX biker he competed regularly, won a state championship, and was featured in ads for Coca Cola and Twix.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             He began working for nightclubs at 15, organizing private parties, racing up and down Washington and Collins on his skateboard posting flyers.

            Well, he’s in Haiti right now for Christmas but he’s a Kabbalah practitioner. Can’t imagine the shit they're doing down there right now. Check out his social media lots to see.

            I did a post on trafficking in Kosovo and Thaci’s ties to Clinton. But also his pic with Joe Biden. Yes Joe invited him to the White House. Thaci was also being investigated for organ trafficking.

            I just tried posting this thread into two conspiracy forums on Reddit. I put Michael Capponi's name in the thread title. Both forums refuse to let me post. I've not had any warnings, suspensions or bans from these forums. Is Capponi's name blacklisted from being talked about?

            One of Capponi's best friends is a guy called Moishe Mana. Moishe is big in the storage industry including storing fine art and wine. The Capponi family in Italy own a winery. We also know people who transport fine art can get around intrusive customs rules. Seems like a guy to know if you're into human trafficking and organ trafficking.

             Finally we are back to shipping containers. Imo any large co has the capacity to deal in these crimes. Yep what you have just detailed most def sounds like they may be involved in shipping humans.

             You may be right. Any sport involving Kids now has the pedo back story. Swimming Basketball etc and if your really good they get what they want from you to let you stay in the game. Remember that his life sounded pretty loose. I don’t think they were keeping an eye on him. Pedos looking for free range Kids.
