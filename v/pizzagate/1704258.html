            . . tl;wr . . We need to try hard not to, even inadvertently, screw over others' work by using attention-drawing post titles on our own work.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most posters here try very hard to create titles that follow common protocol. It creates a neutral space in which everyone can share their work equally, on a level playing field, creating posts which rise on the merit of their content alone. Much exceptional research here is overshadowed by hyperbolic titles, which, whether intentional or not, serves to push other posts down, sometimes into oblivion and often to the detriment of the kids we are trying to save. While everyone can get excited, no post is more important, urgent or valuable than any other here.
           </p>
           <p>
            The extraordinary hard work and effort of people on this forum is diminished by the use of hyperbolic titles (for example by the use of all or partial CAPS, !!!!!!, "** ****, and or exclamations of URGENT, BREAKING, DIG DIG DIG, THIS ONE TO THE TOP, #PODESTAFORPRISON (all in caps), etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've posted my strong feelings on this in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods">
             v/pizzagatemods
            </a>
            , asking them to consider creating a new rule banning such titles. I've also left comments in a meta discussion on the topic, which a user created in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhateverhttps">
             v/pizzagatewhateverhttps
            </a>
            ://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1682030. If anyone is of like mind, please consider:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             1 Also reaching out to the mods - 2 Also leaving comments in the meta discussion - 3 Also leaving reminders, similar to this one, in posts with hyperbolic titles
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            I will continue to speak out on this until it becomes a new rule - or until I give up. At that point, I believe this will not be a neutral forum that highlights the most important research based on merit. Instead, in all likelihood it will eventually descend into a free for all. If you think I'm exaggerating head over to some of the reddit subs and take a look. It would have very different consequences here because reddit, in large part, involves sharing and opinions, while this is critical research directed at saving innocent lives that, by the hundreds, if not thousands, are being taken as we speak.

             I'm fairly certain at this point that voat is a CIA op where we are allowed our little space to sound off, but access is carefully monitored.  I still think it is useful, but there is no use in complaining about how things are.  So far, I think things are going well as they are.  Vault 7 was disappointing to me, because I was hoping for the Hillary emails, but on the other hand it sure was embarrassing to the enemy.   They are losing ground every day.  I think Trump is doing everything right so far.  Our job should be to dig, because I'm sure the good guys watch this.  Even if something gets downvoted or the mods delete it, they will see it.
I could be wrong, and in that case, I'd still recommend the same thing - dig.  Post stuff whether you you think it worthy or not.

            The above is just disgusting! Why would a sex counselor to children need to say such a thing? And why wouldn't he report a male P.E. teacher that was hitting on children instead of making a joke about it in his email to his married lover.

             Because that is their normalcy.  They justify pedophilia if it's "consensual". They pretend to empower minors with self determination so that the minors can "consent."   The 8th grade girls are taught to be empowered to choose which teachers they touch, because its the child's decision. Those girls weren't complaining about sexual harassment, they were bragging about an adult flirting.

             Its all fucked up, but its a multi-generational cult. Their entire foundation is based on aggression against children. The children don't know they are victims, they grow up to be perpetrators. Any outside interference (like pizzagate) is considered by them to be persecution by those who are less enlightened.   enlightened, illuminated, Lucifer.

             Remember when the Obamas moved to Washington and everyone was wondering if they would put their children in DC Public Schools?  OMG equal to Detroit Public Schools.  So the Obamas (and I felt sorry for their obvious need to be politically correct) said they had to place them in a school that could accommodate the Secret Service.

               Thank you for this!!!!!  And for those who don't yet know that the birther conspiracy was never about where Obama was born but who his biological father was  -- Frank Marshall Davis, an African American radical Communist and pornographer. His maternal grandparents were CIA, his mother was a CIA honeypot, here's all the info on it that HILLARY leaked during the 2008 election

                Ocommie looks just like Malcolm X, and his mother was a Malcolm X groupie.  Craniofacial morphology and photographic forensics suggest Malcolm X.

            That school sounds like a flipping mess!  No wonder Melania Trump and Baron are staying in New York.  Would you want your kids to go there after reading these reports.  Hasn't anyone been taught about professional boundaries?  I can not help but notice there are hardly any articles on this scandal.  Though not pedophilia, I do think it points to a rather hostile environment for husband and wife, teacher and child or counsellor and child.
