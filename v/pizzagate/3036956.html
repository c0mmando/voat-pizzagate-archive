<p>Subway pedophile Jared Fogle is \'living the life\' in prison, where he has even received his certificate in culinary arts, a former inmate has revealed to DailyMailTV.</p>
<p>The 41-year-old disgraced sandwich promoter is serving a 15-year sentence in Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) in Englewood, Colorado after pleading guilty to  child pornography charges in 2015. </p>
<p>But Marc Brooks, 41, who served eight months alongside the former Subway spokesman, tells DailyMailTV prison life is treating Fogle well as he spends his time going to the movies, eating fancy foods, making crafts, and even gambling. </p>
<p>\'Yo, he\'s living the life in there, he\'s eating good, working out, cooking...not a care in the world,\' said Brooks, who was released from the facility on January 25.  
</p>
<p>\'It\'s like Club Fed. They\'ve got a movie theater, a fully-equipped gym with weights, ellipticals, StairMasters, cable weights…outside they have a baseball field, tennis court, soccer field, horse shoe pits, a bocce ball court and corn hole.\' </p>
<p>Brooks, from Denver, was serving time for a probation violation and was present when Fogle received his award at a recent graduation ceremony last year. </p>
<p>A jailhouse photo provided by Brooks shows a noticeably-slimmer Fogle, sans eyeglasses, in a mint green jumpsuit at the ceremony with his fellow inmates.  
</p>
<p>\'He got his culinary arts certificate while all these other sex offenders were getting their GEDs and stuff. I took the photos,\' Brooks said. </p>
<p>more at link above.....</p>
<hr />
<p>gee, maybe he\'ll write a children\'s cookbook next? </p>
<p>He also disclosed that Fogle is in a low-level security section of the prison where he is free to roam around.
\'When I first got there I was like &quot;man, you guys have got it made in here!&quot; I couldn\'t even believe it was a prison. It\'s more like a daycare than a prison,\' he said.</p>
<p>\'There\'s a hobby section there for painting, leather work…there\'s people making little toy cars, carpentry…there\'s dudes in there who do crochet and knitting.\'
Other facilities at the FCI include pool tables, ping pong and dart boards, according to Brooks. </p>
<p>\'Subway Guy is in the low security section, he\'s in a dry cell, that means the door is never locked, he can wander around and use the phone, use the computers, use the movie theater, whatever he wants.\'
He added: \'He gets a lot of down time, there\'s a recreation station with cards, Monopoly, Risk, so he can sit outside in the sun and chill with his little sex offender buddies.</p>
<p>Marc Brooks, 41, served eight months alongside Jared Fogle in FCI. He was released on January 25
\'He\'s getting money that he can spend in the commissary store, they have fancy snacks in there, stuff like candy, chips, meats, tuna, mackerel, real nice foods.\'     
</p>
<p>Fogle, 41, gained fame for losing almost 250lbs from eating two Subway sandwiches a day and exercising. He became the face of the sandwich chain in 2000 until his arrest in 2015. 
He pleaded guilty to receiving and distributing child pornography and traveling to pay for sex with minors. 
He is due to be released in 2029. </p>
<p>Brooks is now working in construction since he was freed but recalled how Fogle\'s previous celebrity status made him an easy target among other inmates. </p>
<p>\'When I first got there I would make fun of him, we\'d shout things like, &quot;hey Subway are you going to try and get a job at Quiznos or Jimmy John\'s next?&quot;\'</p>
<p>\'After that I just kept my mouth shut, I didn\'t want to go anywhere near him or his nasty sex offender buddies. 
\'There\'s one sex offender on the range making little stuffed animals, what\'s he going to do with them when he gets out? It\'s horrible.\'</p>',

            "Door is never locked" - sounds scary to me.  In prison, I think you'd want to keep the others out or sleep with one eye open.

Yes it would!!! which is why all that you see since Pizzagate came about everyones Radar.... is a on the fly psychological operation with changing narratives and operatives working in unison to accomplish what?to HURT the HEART of Humanity and usher in their long crafted worldview based on their OCCULT knowledge! its US vs them. or the free willed heart based in righteousness versus the dark duality that is fed to us daily! WAKE UP! be heart christ Consciousness!
