<p><strong>The “Subud” Cult, and Connections Child Trafficking, Ritual Abuse, and CIA Mind Control Covert Operations</strong></p>
<p>Considering the significant connections between Subud and covert intelligence operations going back possibly decades, its horrifying to learn that there is evidence linking members of the Subud cult to child sex trafficking and ritual abuse. As Wayne Madsen writes in “Manufacturing a President”:</p>
<p>“There were reports that some child members of <strong>[Subud] were also involved in the horrific sex abuse case at the McMartin pre-school day 
 care center</strong> in Manhattan Beach, California in the 1980s. <strong>The McMartin pedophile ring was linked to members of the military, Los 
 Angeles Police Department, and the U.S. intelligence community.</strong>”</p>
<p>Independent investigator Alex Constantine did some, in my opinion, important research into the McMartin abuse scandal, which he wrote about in this article “McMartin Preschool Revisited” <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/constantine3.html">here</a>, and in his <a href="https://www.stopeg.com/tinet.nl/public/browse-online/raven1-eleanor-white/mcf/cnst-nws.htm">article</a> “Time Machine: Muffled Screams, Singed Synapses.” In particular to McMartin, I also highly recommend author David Mcgowan’s book “Programmed to Kill: The Politics of Serial Murder,” where he goes into extensive detail about the McMartin case, and the horrific evidence of suspicious deaths, judicial corruption, and more pointing towards a cover-up of ritual abuse and child sex trafficking in that case. In his McMartin articles, Alex Constantine quotes the research of, and interviews, Dr. Catherine Gould, an LA-area child therapist. Ritual abuse survivor Brice Taylor, in her book “Thanks for the Memories,” specifically credits Dr. Catherine Gould for saving her life. She claims that Dr. Gould played a major role in helping her escape and stay free from the elite trafficking ring that Brice Taylor alleged she was abused and controlled by.</p>
<p>In his “Time Machine” article, Constantine links the Subud group directly to the ritual abuse and mind control experimentation alleged to have been happening at the McMartin school in the 80s and possibly before. Constantine writes:</p>
<p>“<strong>The McMartin mind control experiments were reportedly the work of Subud, a religious sect with roots in Indonesia and the UK</strong>, according to confidential informants (active members who submitted to injections of sodium pentathol before questioning.)”</p>
<p>Wayne Madsen also reports that the Subud group has links to CIA-run mind control programs: “Other critics have pointed to the connections between the Subud movement, and CIA mind control operations, especially those directed at children and others that administer sodium pentothal to unwitting subjects.”</p>
<p>I’m sure people are wondering, amongst many other things, why these heinous, and clearly extremely “black op”-type covert activities would be hidden away within some obscure little religious cult from Indonesia, with a current membership of only 10,000 people. Interestingly, Alex Constantine makes the argument that back in the 60s, the CIA started to fear public exposure of its covert mind control operations. (Obviously, CIA-run mind control experiments being run on presumably unwitting and unwilling adults and children, is obvious inherently a humans right abuse of highest order) <strong>According to Constantine, in order to better hide these kind of operations, the Agency basically started to hide the mind control programs in a bunch of seemingly-“random” front groups that were scattered all over the world. Constantine describes Subud as being one of these CIA front groups used by Agency to continue its mind control experimentations and operations.</strong> Constantine writes:</p>
<p>“In the mid-\'60s, the technological oligarchs of the Agency feared exposure. Newspaper reporters had caught wind of Auschwitzian behavioral modification research funded by the government. Congress was asking questions. The thugs at Langley scratched their heads. It was only a matter of time before some inquisitive reporter exposed the rot of mind control. The solution: CIA scientists bugged out of the laboratory. <strong>The experiments were moved into the community.</strong></p>
<p>Eccentric religious groups were organized or co-opted by intelligence operators, including the Peoples\' Temple, the Symbionese Liberation Army, the Ordo Templis Orientis (OTO), Finders, the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh Movement and Switzerland\'s Solar Temple, among others. In 1966 <strong>Charles Buckey built a preschool in Manhattan Beach, California</strong>. Buckey was an engineer at Hughes Aircraft. This was a period when everyone said, &quot;<strong>Hughes is the CIA.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>The McMartin mind control experiments were reportedly the work of <strong>Subud</strong>, a religious sect with roots in Indonesia and the UK, according to confidential informants (active members who submitted to injections of sodium pentothal before questioning).</p>
<p><strong>The cult is a cut-out of the American security elite\'s mind control fraternity.</strong> One of Subud\'s leading lights is Janet Morris, a science fiction writer and charter member of the Association for Electronic Defense. She is also research director of the U.S. Global Strategy Council, a Washington &quot;think tank&quot; founded by ultra-conservatives Claire Booth Luce, General Maxwell Taylor, General Richard Stillwell, former CIA Deputy Director Ray Cline, and the abrasive Jeane Kirkpatrick, among others. </p>
<p>Another prominent member of the <strong>Subud sect is an executive of a major toy company - a leading maker of virtual-reality computer games for children, like the ones used by CIA scientists to traumatize young subjects.</strong>”</p>
