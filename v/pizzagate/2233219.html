            Feldman has covered for Reiner in the past he said Reiner is a good man but I think Reiner did rape Haim. So did Charlie Sheen but Reiner looks and sounds like the guy who would be a pedo ring mastermind.

            .Most of the Voat users had no clue this post was up due to the quickness that it was taken down.
           </p>
           <p>
            **"A man tried to run over parents and their children at a train museum. Witnesses and victims think this was an intentional act, read the article comments.

           <p>
            The museum is across the street from the Rob Reiner Children and Families Center
           </p>
           <p>
            This is related to pizzagate because Rob Reiner is circumstantially tied to sexually assaulting Corey Haim. Reiner follows the Jerry Sandusky / The Second Mile model of interfacing with deprived children.

            VIDEO: Hollywood Blabbermouth Rob Reiner Suspiciously Defensive, Blames Trump for Harvey Weinstein’s Alleged Rapes OCT. 17 2017
           </p>
           <p>
            "Ask Rob Reiner about Harvey Weinstein and suddenly he sounds like a worried man. A very worried man. Perhaps he should be.
           </p>
           <p>
            Smoke. Fire.
           </p>
           <p>
            A seasoned investigator would be lining Reiner up for a polygraph after watching this display of lunacy." "And the morons posing as journalists at MSNBC’s Morning Joe are no better.
           </p>
           <p>
            Listen for yourself. Watch the wheels comes off Reiner’s alibis for Weinstein as he tries to pin Hollywood’s sex abuse troubles on everyone except Hollywood."
           </p>
           <p>
            LOOK TO THE COMMENTS : "Greta G • 22 days ago He is acting suspicious, like a perp returning to the scene of crime talking to police or just protesting too much, unwittingly bringing attention to himself. Reminds me of Raskolnikov gabbing to Petrovitch in Crime and Punishment. Rob Reiner is rumored to be a pedophile. Corey Haim."

           <p>
            "Morning Joe co-anchor Willie Geist asked Reiner,
           </p>
           <p>
            "There are millions and millions of people who do not watch this show that actually like what they hear from Donald Trump. And they aren't taking messages and orders from us in the media. But they listen to what he says for themselves and vote for him. How do you explain that?"
           </p>
           <p>
            "There are a lot of people who are racist," Reiner quickly replied.
           </p>
           <p>
            Joe Scarborough was shocked, remarking, "Oh my God, did you just say that?" Enjoy the cringe-worthy moment..."

            Alternatively, I think exposing Hollywood could be used as a way to prepare the minds of the masses to see how many in DC are controlled by pedophilia in the same way. Most normies follow TMZ and Hollywood. When they see easily that it exists in that realm, their minds could become open to seeing how it exists in other circles of power.

                Ya  but he does and it creeps me out. I'm not even really up to date on pizzagate and all the whole shebang, but this feldman guy and charlie sheen both creep me out for exactly the same reason because I can't look at one without thinking about the other regardless of if pizzagate even existed.   It's just weird as hell.

                  I cant stand looking at either but I honestly think there is some relation there, I mean it can't just be me there is an uncanny resemblance,  I think it's the eyes amd the jawline mostly, newer pctures of charlie he has that mangled broken nose, but pre broken nose charlie looks an aweful lot like corey feldman. I'm not tryng to start a conspiracy or anything  but it is something I noticed as a casual observer of this whole shit show.   Also suspicipous considering the dude claims Sheen raped Haim, and Haim claims Sheen as a good guy..  I'm just a spectator though I'm just wathcing it all play out. but it's shitty and creepy the more we learn about it.

                   Well, one thing we know for sure is that Sheen is Not a good guy.   He was on that filthy show which is still in reruns.  They had him on and then replaced him with Ashton Kutcher.  Evidently they are into spreading their filth.  Personally I think many people are so caught up in Corey's music still that they can't get over how creepy he is too.  They are both creepy and Kutcher creeps me out too.  I hated him for taking Demi for a ride and dumping her, but I am over that now.  I now realize that was all part of the plan.  Get over it people. Wake up.  I have had to get over many of my idols so I understand at the beginning, but we MUST start throwing these people under the bus.  The don't care about us.  REALLY.

             Maybe he doesn't know better? 
Maybe he just knows what happened to him and to his friends in Hollywood while shooting movies? 
And so he might think, the whole "Pizzagate"-story is so over the moon, that he just thinks it's b.s.?
And, like most good young liberal guys he's voting the Democrats, of course. Guess he's not much thinking about these things.
That doesn't make him a "Shill", but someone who just doesn't have a clue...
             <br/>
             But if he's helping to draw attention on the Pedowood-issue, it will be fine for me. It will make other victims speak out. And so we will be getting a little bit closer to the big picture.

            I'm tired of listening to this guy's rants. He totally discounts the environment that Hollywood is. There is so much abuse, MK mind control, Harvey Weinsteins sicking the Black Cube Mossad on people, torture, forced rape, death threats, etc....that is just a short list.
           </p>
           <p>
            The maker of this video assumes that these people are always acting of their own volition and nothing could be further from the truth. There is a damn good reason people don't just speak up when they get abused in Hollywood. People are scared literally to death to speak out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Discounting the environment these things take place in makes these videos rather worthless in my eyes. The author in the video is living in black and white world. There is nothing cut and dried in Hollywood. They should name it The Grey Swamp because everything is grey.

             Why are you even in this voat forum if your going to continue supporting a controlled opposition who denies pizzagate over and over again. Who supported Hillary Clinton and her rapist husband while supposedly exposing pedophilia. You clearly are to ignorant to see through an obvious controlled Zionist shill. Get over your self please.  I suggest you take time to realize who is actually stuck in a black and white trance.

              Your lack of understanding of Hollywood sexual abuse is so glaring that I won't even attempt to formulate an answer to that. If you have not learned anymore than you know now then i'm not your teacher. Lurk more, learn more.
