            There is nothing ridiculous about using a Pizza Parlour for nefarious stuff, that kind of business has been used as fronts to launder money since forever.  Great way of sending messages/drugs etc whatever.  Have a special item that is "off menu" and when someone orders it you put some drugs under the pizza in the box for example, or a note saying "ATTACK AT DAWN" or whatever.

             I know that, however, it's the brain dead masses that get their news from CNN who claim these things are impossible, couldn't happen, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             Showing historical proof for the things we are claiming only raises the pain of cognitive dissonance in these types of people and hopefully by establishing such exists we can break some of their conditioning.

             Unfortunately I've been through the 6 pizza pages and didn't find anything that good but there's a lot in the database. Human trafficking, organ harvesting, selling children.

             Here is a link to a PDF showing the CIA is alleged to be involved in human trafficking of Infants for their organs

              Insistence on "facts" about PG is a problem. We don't have many, I think PG is right only in the broad, not in the direct.  We're stumbling around in the dark and keep bumping into things.  When the lights come on it will be a lot clearer right now we know something is up, but not in enough detail.  Our detractors will rightly laugh at us for the images we conjure out of the dark.  I see it as best not to draw conclusions, but to just keep on showing the connections and see where the dice fall.
