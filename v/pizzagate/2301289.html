Pizzagate | Did You Know That Comet Ping Pong Pizza Lies at the Bottom of an Inverted Pentagram?
Did you know that Comet Ping Pong Pizza lies at the bottom of an inverted pentagram?</p>

<p>The Pizza Pentagram
Comet Ping Pong lies at the bottom of an inverted pentagram, just as the White House is positioned at the bottom of its inverted pentagram. The two are connected, literally, by Connecticut Ave. On the Pizza Pentagram, two of its points lie exactly on the edge of the 100 mile square border of the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>You might already be familiar with the pentagram of the White House, but did you know there is a Pizza Pentagram?
The points of this pentagram must be investigated. I’ve already found children’s organizations and schools on every point. Some of the organizations have suspicious logos and symbolism on their website that should be further investigated by #Pizzagate researchers.
Suspects and Investigation of the Pizza Pentagram: BOTTOM: Besta Pizza, Comet Ping Pong, Buck’s Fishing &amp; Camping, Beyond Borders, etc, We already know they are involved. The evidence is overwhelming that they are involved in pedophilia.

            This answer-post, while possibly annoying some, is more relevant on the broader subject of the continuing degradation of knowledge with this symbol. Especially consider the army kids echoing the halls. And the generally pop-culture exploitation constantly undermining
            <strong>
             real investigations.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The pentagram has nothing to do with the devil.
It is sacred geometry, in contemporary jargon.
It would be easy to now correlate this with occultism.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Star is a a scared symbol;
- Man
- Stars
- The Lotus
- Zero point geometry (origins/levels/transformations)
           </p>
           <p>
            The Army employees the power of logos effectively, and most accurately;
- Notice that a captial letter "A" represents the head of a star
- Notice that a pyramid and capstone appear within the letter's negative space (gestalt)
           </p>
           <p>
            The pentagram has to do with the devil. As a perversion of man's goal to ascend. The geometry of a goat's head is unique, but coincidental—so much so, that I would consider it a dummy's attempt at trying to codify or hide "star power"—
           </p>
           <p>
            Jewish redactors, and Talmudists ascribe to being "star people". But this statement will deviate some people's interest, so just note this for another time. Do not maintain it as a way to describe the symbol and it's meanings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Did the Jewish redactors invert man through his weakness and perversion?
Are celebrities exploited by inverting their nature, to become a star?
           </p>
           <p>
            What does rabbit-foot soup taste like?

              Nope.   All this time and you have the crime of Weiner who was not part of the Podesta emails and who did his creeping with adults until this girl reached out to him.  You chain of equality falls apart right there.

              Also you realize is all this time, no one has ever come forward with any evidence Hillary Clinton met Alefantis, right?   People claim this a lot.   But still no evidence of it.

              Incredibly dumb.   Do you think the President of the United States sets up phone banks?

             <p>
              Anyone can declare their business or even their home as a phone banking place for a political party.  You basically sign up at the website and the campaign gives you want you need.   The whole point is to have neighborhood locations where people can phonebank.  And these locations are all over the country.  The candidate is certainly not the person doing this.

             <p>
              This one burns it's so stupid.  Zero donations were made to Comet Ping Pong which is a business not a charity or Political Action Committee.   Disbursements from a Political Action Committee are any time you pay out money.   If you buy pens, or pay the rent or have signs printed up, this are all disbursements and all tracked.  So they probably either bought a bunch of pizzas or rented the space, either way, these are payments to a business not donations.

               Each link is a close personal association between one and the other. As a voter, I judge candidates by the company they keep and the artwork and photos they display or condone. That is all the proof I need. GOOD RIDDANCE TO THE CLINTONS AND THEIR PERVERTED FRIENDS. How many friends and acquaintances do you have that met questionable VIOLENT deaths...Hmmmm? OOPS! Left out Pedosta. That Uranium 1 deal isn't going so well.

Maybe. Looks like he was rigging the 2016 election from the White House. IS THIS WHY SCHMIDT STEPPED DOWN??????

            Vacation Bible School is responsible for indoctrinating our children . They tried it with me when I was just 8. 
It's up to US as parents to learn the truth in turn teach it to our kids not have a government funded church on wheels come teach our kids lies! I do hope and pray you all question every bit of what you think is truth about God and Jesus

             The citizens are part of the government. We have many eyes. We can watch and expose. This alone can put a damper on their activity.
Teach your children to be aware. There is power in numbers. Just look at what is being exposed in Hollywood.
