<p>There is one piece of evidence that sticks from all the rest though. I\'m talking about the hacker bigfish that claims he hacked the CPP website and found shitloads of kiddy porn. </p>

<p>We know the police emailed him back several times because we have the emails posted in the video by titus frost.

<p>First post, i lurked a lot until i got locked out when you guys went dark, I saw on pol that you all had open registration up again so i came over here quick and jumped on it. Hope its not a super shitty post. anyway nice to be here faggots</p>',

                     Yes, if you can do it - it would be huge. Royal Order of Jesters were once connected to human trafficking/pedophilia.

            Anything with TitusFrost in it or evidence brought forward by him would make me suspect it is bullshit. I didn't trust anything he said 3 years ago and now even more so.

             That’s absolutely correct. Big fish did hack into CPP, he archived it on the 8th of November/December 2016 using WaybackMachine machine. The page exists for sure and it belongs to the same url as CPP.
            </p>
            <p>
             As explained already, taking screenshots from CP is illegal, distributing it even as evidence is considered circulating cp. All he could do was to report it, which he did. He didn’t stop there though, he went to many PizzaGaters and told his story, tried to get the word out. One can’t expect more from him.
            </p>
            <p>
             Big Fish is genuine. He did find what he says he found.

              That wasn't the problem, blacknighthigh. The problem was he was not fully redpilled when he reported it to the DC police. He did not expect them to be part of it. He did not realize for several weeks -- not until he saw the Comet shooter story on the news, I believe -- that the cops had been playing games with him. At that point, he went to the FBI. No action there, either. When I reached out to him on Twitter a couple of years ago, he told me that he did not mention it to anyone on social media until after the fake "pizza menu" "hackers" showed up to muddy the waters and the guy shot up Comet. At that point, he tried to approach journalists, including Fox affiliates, and they wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole. He couldn't even get them to FOIA the evidence from the police.
             </p>
             <p>
              Like many of us, he simply could not imagine the scale and universal scope of courruption that would kick into play to cover up the story. For me, it was the brutal, organized, cross-platform censorship from the NYT, WaPo, Wired, Popular Mechanics, the Reddit ban, Google Search tampering, Wikipedia tampering to the scrubbing of Sli.mg where we'd hosted most screencaps of the Podesta art collection and the perps' social media attempting to silence us and shut down our research that proved this was real. It was the most chilling thing I'd ever witnessed.
             </p>
             <p>
              Bigfish was no different.
             </p>
             <p>
              And to his credit, he has never dropped or changed his story, or revealed his RL identity. He is still very active on Twitter and will answer questions. He constantly spreads info about the pedo elite. He told me it was a tough wakeup for him to find out just how corrupt our government and law enforcement are.
