<p>&quot;You guys are so caught up you did not see this occurring. I have three direct victims of MK Ultra high profile children I have been entrusted with their stories as they watched Voat pizzagate for months to see who they could trust.</p>
<p>You think they picked me because I Post disinfo? They did because I personally know the darkest aspects of pizzagate.</p>
<p>But when threatened you ban me and smear me and will not say one thing that is disinfo??&quot;</p>

<p>Excuse me can you point out any disinfo that I posted? I have asked you repeatedly to do this and you won’t. Point out the disinfo <a href="https://voat.co/user/Vindicator">@Vindicator</a> even one thing? You did not even follow that day correctly. I posted about Saudi Waleed, Mandolay Bay, Paddock, Danley and Uranium One. Every thing I posted came true. How did I have that info ahead of time? I might be an actual original source. And I have stated repeatedly the threat I am under by posting any of it but am doing it anyway for these kids, and whistleblowers all over. Then you smeared me like you have here. @ finals thank you. You are correct many top researchers have left pizzagate because of this....</p>

<p>Hey <a href="https://voat.co/user/darkknight111">@darkknight111</a> did you no post about Vindicator banning me from pizzagate.</p>
<p>I was exposing the connections to weapons transferring, trafficking of children and drugs to the Las Vegas event.. I obtained all the records of this guy, financials, property, work history, even his plane he bought with a tail number connected to defense agency.</p>
<p>I made a breadcrumb post about it and Vindicator calls my post clickbait, denigrating me, as a shill who is not here to find pedos or children.</p>
<p>Then a couple of new alts joined calling me a pedo and pedo protector. Saying I\'m an idiot.</p>
<p>This happened right after AreweSure came at me again. I had noticed Vindicator about the threats, he said I don\'t see them nothing I can do.</p>
<p>I explained we had them saved in a location and he basically laughed it off, then the new alts joined him saying how funny it was that they could say what they wanted because I was banned.</p>
<p>He has never reinstated me for three days. I have asked for a response and get nothing. He knows my life has been put in danger and he knows the direct threats made by AreweSure.</p>
<p>Can you ask <a href="https://voat.co/user/putitout">@putitout</a> for me. Thanks, Jem</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/2213935/10912118">https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/2213935/10912118</a></p>
<p>For info I am still banned and now an account that does not usually respond on pizzagate is calling me a disinfo shill protecting pedos. Then laughing because I am banned. This is a targeted coordinated attack. I have the documents ecspecially on Las Vegas shooter &amp; ties to CIA.</p>
<p>I also have the truth of Adam Lanza &amp; Sandy Hook and the true identity of somewhere who was very powerful that people spent years wondering about.</p>
<p>They fact I am being called as a Federal Whistleblower might have something to say as what I am in possession of.</p>
<p>Can someone get my back on pizzagate.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/2210356/10898314">https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/2210356/10898314</a></p>
<p>I edited my post. It has links to the connection of Las Vegas to pizzagate. It also has the Illuminati founder Adam Weishaupt great grandson Issac Weishaupt explaining the Illuminati ritual that occurred. Including explanation of the Sphinx, Pyramid, and Obleisk.</p>
<p>I have the documents linking Paddock to defense contractors weapons trade, his personal plane information tail number, all properties, including documents of property records, who he has been seen with and locations for at least ten years.</p>
<p>That is why Vindicator actually banned me then attempted to discredited me.</p>
<p>These documents have been securely placed for safe keeping. Not on me or with me. They are in the hands of capable people in many locations. One in Washington DC.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/2210356/10888515">https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/2210356/10888515</a></p>
<p>I stopped linking you guys cause nothing gets done. By the time any of you respond the poster deletes.</p>
<p>Ask <a href="https://voat.co/user/darkknight111">@darkknight111</a> about the death threat to &quot;Scalia me&quot;with a picture of Marfa, Tx ranch then to make a victim of me by showing me Dahmer\'s headless victim.</p>
<p>This was not a troll either. I have identified him as an agent he abuses and threatens anyone who gets near the truth. Several great researchers have quit because of fear from him.</p>
<p>I had to use my own skills and someone else in this forum to save his threats to a safe location because you guys never respond.</p>
<p>And Vindicator you seemed to care in the beginning about abortionburger getting threatened. I got death threats with visuals from an insider who knows about Salia Ranch murder but had to go to other sources for protection since you joined MF in the deleting important info game. I sent a response to MF inbox and you replied indicating you are the same person or you pass around messages we send to particular Mods. I have told you guys on countless occasions I M in danger. My life has been threatened even at my own home which could have only happened from doxing on here or someone higher up having access to all of our messages and IP addresses.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2205201/10867467">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2205201/10867467</a></p>
<p>I have received direct death threats including showing me pictures of Marfa, Tx (Scalia Muder scene) when that did not intimidate me they showed a picture of Jeffrey Dahmers headless victim in the &quot;arch of hysteria&quot; position on top of a mattress. Then asked me if I felt sorry for the mattress.</p>
<p>I was also jumped at my home 8 weeks ago and told to keep my fucking mouth shut. And have been told it appears this was a hit job.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2206079/10862047">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2206079/10862047</a></p>
<p>Fuck him. He threatened me with death yesterday twice. It was saved in a secure location. He has tried to delete it but it has been caught. He is more than a shill that is the problem. I have called him out as an agent many times to his ridiculous denial. He played his hand yesterday by threatening with pictures of death scenes only sophisticated insiders would put forth.</p>

<p>It seems as if <a href="https://voat.co/user/Are_We_Sure">@Are_We_Sure</a> did not want keep his death threats to me out in public.</p>
<p>I saved them. No worries. He also has inside knowledge of what happened in Marfa, Texas with Justice Scalia since he chose the picture to threaten me and followed it up with pictures of Dahmers headless victims.</p>

<p>Please read through comments. Are_we_sure just thought he would flash pictures of Marfa, Tx Ciablo Ranch (location of Justice Scalia murder) then when I did not back down showed me picture of Jeffrey Dahmer headless victim.</p>
<p>I have been in contact with people with concerns for my safety.</p>
<p>I am serious. Please copy/paste somewhere.</p>

<p>Damn I just got threatened by Are_we_sure. He showed me the map of Marfa, Texas where Scalia was murdered by HRC/Podesta then showed me Jeffrey Dahmer headless victim.</p>
<p>I knew he was top fb* JT*F.....but he is directly threatening me.</p>
<p>I was jumped and beaten 8 weeks ago and told to keep my fucking mouth shut.</p>
<p>Have asked for protection....nothing.</p>

<p>There are many of us that are not 27 but served our country and when faced with corruption, covering up crimes of the elite, took a stand and risked it all. Some of them are dead, others are on &quot;low intensity target lists&quot; others are on &quot;high intensity target lists&quot; some of us are literally receiving death threats and assaulted warning us to &quot;keep our fucking mouth shut&quot;</p>
<p>We have been pushing this since before the election after making conscious decisions it would likely cost our lives.</p>
<p>Staying alive right now is a daily battle.</p>

<p>Awan is not just a patsy...he works for the CIA we have proven that.</p>
<p>And yes there are actual former members of three letter agencies.</p>
<p>Comey, Mueller, and McCabe are done. McCabe is the worse one of all he literally took a $700,000 bribe from MacAulliffe during the Clinton email investigation.</p>
<p>Then planned out and initiated a plan to take out General Flynn then Trump.</p>
<p>We have the evidence.</p>

<p>Ready to testify. Bring it on in open court before the public...ala Nuremberg trials</p>

           did you no post about Vindicator banning me from pizzagate.
          </p>
          <p>
           I was exposing the connections to weapons transferring, trafficking of children and drugs to the Las Vegas event.. I obtained all the records of this guy, financials, property, work history, even his plane he bought with a tail number connected to defense agency.
          </p>
          <p>
           I made a breadcrumb post about it and Vindicator calls my post clickbait, denigrating me, as a shill who is not here to find pedos or children.
          </p>
          <p>
           Then a couple of new alts joined calling me a pedo and pedo protector. Saying I'm an idiot.
          </p>
          <p>
           This happened right after AreweSure came at me again. I had noticed Vindicator about the threats, he said I don't see them nothing I can do.
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
           He has never reinstated me for three days. I have asked for a response and get nothing. He knows my life has been put in danger and he knows the direct threats made by AreweSure.

          <p>
           I also have the truth of Adam Lanza &amp; Sandy Hook and the true identity of somewhere who was very powerful that people spent years wondering about.
          </p>
          <p>
           They fact I am being called as a Federal Whistleblower might have something to say as what I am in possession of.
          </p>
          <p>
           Can someone get my back on pizzagate.

           I edited my post. It has links to the connection of Las Vegas to pizzagate. It also has the Illuminati founder Adam Weishaupt great grandson Issac Weishaupt explaining the Illuminati ritual that occurred. Including explanation of the Sphinx, Pyramid, and Obleisk.
          </p>

           I have the documents linking Paddock to defense contractors weapons trade, his personal plane information tail number, all properties, including documents of property records, who he has been seen with and locations for at least ten years.

           That is why Vindicator actually banned me then attempted to discredited me.
          </p>
          <p>
           These documents have been securely placed for safe keeping. Not on me or with me. They are in the hands of capable people in many locations. One in Washington DC.

           about the death threat to "Scalia me"with a picture of Marfa, Tx ranch then to make a victim of me by showing me Dahmer's headless victim.
          </p>
          <p>
           This was not a troll either. I have identified him as an agent he abuses and threatens anyone who gets near the truth. Several great researchers have quit because of fear from him.
          </p>
          <p>
           I had to use my own skills and someone else in this forum to save his threats to a safe location because you guys never respond.
          </p>
          <p>
           And Vindicator you seemed to care in the beginning about abortionburger getting threatened. I got death threats with visuals from an insider who knows about Salia Ranch murder but had to go to other sources for protection since you joined MF in the deleting important info game. I sent a response to MF inbox and you replied indicating you are the same person or you pass around messages we send to particular Mods. I have told you guys on countless occasions I M in danger. My life has been threatened even at my own home which could have only happened from doxing on here or someone higher up having access to all of our messages and IP addresses.

           I have received direct death threats including showing me pictures of Marfa, Tx (Scalia Muder scene) when that did not intimidate me they showed a picture of Jeffrey Dahmers headless victim in the "arch of hysteria" position on top of a mattress. Then asked me if I felt sorry for the mattress.

           I was also jumped at my home 8 weeks ago and told to keep my fucking mouth shut. And have been told it appears this was a hit job.

           Fuck him. He threatened me with death yesterday twice. It was saved in a secure location. He has tried to delete it but it has been caught. He is more than a shill that is the problem. I have called him out as an agent many times to his ridiculous denial. He played his hand yesterday by threatening with pictures of death scenes only sophisticated insiders would put forth.

           did not want keep his death threats to me out in public.
          </p>
          <p>
           I saved them. No worries. He also has inside knowledge of what happened in Marfa, Texas with Justice Scalia since he chose the picture to threaten me and followed it up with pictures of Dahmers headless victims.

           Please read through comments. Are_we_sure just thought he would flash pictures of Marfa, Tx Ciablo Ranch (location of Justice Scalia murder) then when I did not back down showed me picture of Jeffrey Dahmer headless victim.

           Damn I just got threatened by Are_we_sure. He showed me the map of Marfa, Texas where Scalia was murdered by HRC/Podesta then showed me Jeffrey Dahmer headless victim.

           There are many of us that are not 27 but served our country and when faced with corruption, covering up crimes of the elite, took a stand and risked it all. Some of them are dead, others are on "low intensity target lists" others are on "high intensity target lists" some of us are literally receiving death threats and assaulted warning us to "keep our fucking mouth shut"
          </p>
          <p>
           We have been pushing this since before the election after making conscious decisions it would likely cost our lives.

            I don’t want to disrespect the dead. I’m very sad. But, I stayed in touch with Jem. She gave a lot of disinfo. I kept my promise and wasn’t public about her going with George Webb. Not many people knew.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, her and George Webb went to Comet Ping Pong. She had changed her mind about James Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong. She started defending him. At first I caught her in a lie. I saved our conversations on Twitter’s private messages.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are a lot of other things. She wasn’t a saint. She also exaggerated a lot. I just don’t want anyone having the idea that all these posts and comments she made are true or as blown up she may have made it sound. She was the type of person that needed to feel important.
           </p>
           <p>
            That being said, nobody deserves to die. She did go put her life at risk going with George Webb. I think she was a good person. But be careful believing everything you see here.

              I don’t want to disrespect the dead. I’m very sad. But, I stayed in touch with Jem. She gave a lot of disinfo. I kept my promise and wasn’t public about her going with George Webb. Not many people knew.
             </p>
             <p>
              But, her and George Webb went to Comet Ping Pong. She had changed her mind about James Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong. She started defending him. At first I caught her in a lie. I saved our conversations on Twitter’s private messages.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are a lot of other things. She wasn’t a saint. She also exaggerated a lot. I just don’t want anyone having the idea that all these posts and comments she made are true or as blown up she may have made it sound. She was the type of person that needed to feel important.
             </p>
             <p>
              That being said, nobody deserves to die. She did go put her life at risk going with George Webb. I think she was a good person. But be careful believing everything you see here.

             I can confirm what srayzie just said. There is more here than meets the eye. All is not what it seems.

              I’m debating on whether or not it’s bad for me to do that because she’s gone. I don’t want to tarnish her name. I just want to make people aware.
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe share privately with who wants to know. Or maybe people don’t think it’s wrong to share . This is tough.

               Getting right down to it, we're actually only
               <strong>
                told
               </strong>
               that she's dead.  I take nothing at face value any more and certainly hope it's a case of her faking her death to get out from under the targeting.  Or maybe she was being led down a bad path.  I never really knew what to think of her because of her associations with GW, who I never thought was legit, and WIC, who never answered my specific questions directly.
              </p>
              <p>
               You didn't share the tweets before she died, so I'm guessing her reported death isn't the whole reason you're hesitant.  Potential backlash from the Voat community might have made you think twice, and I can certainly understand that.  The best you can do is follow your gut.
              </p>
              <p>
               My feeling is that on a research board the goal should be to honestly shine a light on all sides in the pursuit of truth and to share it with as many people as possible so it can't be singled out and smothered by anti-truth forces.

                 The only reports of her death that I've seen are from George Webb and the original True Pundit article, and both were working with her.  Have you seen any official reports of her death or statement from her family?

                     Is this the one you were talking about?  The reference here to the "M.E." is a little unusual for a family comment, I'd say.

                       Yes, we're clearly not getting a complete or straight story.  Will be interesting to see whether Thomas Paine does in fact release what she is said to have uncovered.

                I’ll gather things and even conversations from here. Then we can go from there and see what I should share. Maybe I can DM with you.

                I thought that maybe she could have faked her death. But I think George’s emotions were real. I’d feel REALLY bad if she’s alive and I share.

                 <p>
                  Take alot of prayer and time with your decision

                  Thank you. I appreciate that. I’ve been going thru them. It’s some crazy blown up stories mixed with half truths, exaggeratand and changed to make it appear that somehow she comes to the rescue and does some heroic move..

                 You know what, fuck it, this is what this place is for, if you SEE something, SAY something,  everything you have could be valuable to furthering the investigation not only into her death but pizzagate as well.

                 It's a conspiracy, post it, analyze it and let's move forward. If there's a controversy wrapped up in a conundrum about Jem777 death then we should all know about it.

            Great post...
           </p>
           <p>
            I made this comment on another post. I’ll repost here...
           </p>
           <p>
            Omg! That is so sad 😢
           </p>
           <p>
            I’ve known this whole time that she was Task Force and with George Webb. But I didn’t voice it publicly because she didn’t want everyone to know. She was really active here until she left and joined him.
           </p>
           <p>
            She was
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Jem777">
             @Jem777
            </a>
            and
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/mej777">
             @mej777
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            She used to say that she was gang stalked and that she was leaving, and being put in the Witness Protection Program. She left California and joined George Webb and stayed with him until now.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since she was in the witness protection program, she wouldn’t show her face on video. She always said they were going to come after her. She said her fiancé was murdered 7 years ago. 🙁
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is her Twitter...

             Srayzie, did you ever see proof the real life person was connected to the Voat accounts? How did she prove it to you? Were the messages you got all from the Voat accounts?
            </p>
            <p>
             I am trying to understand what is going on here. This apparent reverence many people have for Jen Moore (whose work I have never seen) does not fit with my experience with Jem777, and I'm seeing lots of unverified claims and toxic accusations being thrown around. The whole thing looks like a disinfo attack a la Corsi.

             George is in front of the story for a reason.

             This is very real. This is not a game. This is a Holy War - the Final War.

             Look back at the Videos before they started their disagreements - there are a few that stand out related to Voat.

             The danger is very real to those who know that are not part of the game.

                It's hard to take you seriously when you just keep repeating the same thing. If you have info, spill it! This cryptic and repetitive riddler nonsense isn't helping anything!

              I knew you were a fuckin dick. But can you really steep that low? To be disrespectful about someone who died? Put away your jealousy of George Webb for once. Do you have even an ounce of class? Compassion? She’s only been gone for 1 day.

            This all sounds like a giant voat soap opera. By the way, if she got banned why not just make a new alt? or spread her news/research in another forum like conspiracy? Voat is corrupt and has been since it went down way back in, what, Jan 2017? I bet 99% on here are frauds. I don’t talk shit about most anyone on here (except for good ol MF) but I’ve got most of you pegged, especially the most “virtuous” ones. I guess I hold out hope that some ray of truth will get through here unadulterated but props to all you spooks who run this joint, you did a bang up job of cutting our balls off. (

            Thank you for that post. I remember when that all happened. I was thinking it was MF that was banning her, not Vindicator.  I couldn’t remember. I tried speaking to him at the time and it did not matter. So sad. I tried to reach out to Wisconsin and he never answered my msg.  we had conversations prior regarding names I had found related to Racine.  He was appreciative for the research.  This is not a game and I think most people know that and are ready to put up their life for justice and saving the kids. Fuck these sick, twisted bastards.

            You are onto something very big
           </p>
           <p>
            That is quite an understatement. This situation is extremely scary, and the only thing scarier than speaking the Truth is ignoring it and allowing their agenda to become reality. The Truth is the only way.

           <p>
            Hope you feel better soon, and when you do we hope you keep digging. You are getting very close to putting some major pieces together. Google plays a significant role with Amazon, Foxconn, Facebook (see Sheryl Sandberg and others), IBM, Twitter, and a lpng line of investors such as Thiel, Branson, Kutcher, Oseary, Burkle, Cuban and others involved. It is not only about global enslavement but eternal enslavement. They must also control any emerging tech startups to make sure they follow the agenda.

            We only have a minute quick but you are making many, many important connections. These groups are all linked together for the same agenda. Google is not what they seem and they have controlled VC funding in the tech industry to control and stifle any emerging threats and startups. They are all working for the same evil and corrupt leaders - the Committee of 300 and the Council of 13. Their agenda is absolute control at all levels. You are knocking in their door.
