<blockquote>
<p>Silencing is a common tactic use by perpetrators of childhood sexual violence; many survivors of sexual trauma remain silent out of shame and fear. They are justified in doing so. For children, the threat of further harm is very real and perpetrators depend on secrecy. Even for adults, victim-blaming, stigma and re-traumatization may accompany disclosure. In Southern culture, the norm of the \'good girl\' combined with the adage of \'speak when you are spoken to\' closes the door on information sharing. It also affirms the lie that perpetrators often tell their victims:  they will not be believed.

</blockquote>
<p>While we need to be wary of false claims, we likewise need to be sure we don\'t start blaming victims.  If we are going to avoid blaming victims we need to understand the culture of silence, which varies over time and in each specific situation.  A mother may refuse to believe her daughters are being abused by their step father because she needs the income.  A parent may not believe the respected pastor could do such a thing.  A child may be told from the earliest years that priests are god\'s representatives on earth and to be obeyed.  A runaway may go to whoever gives them a meal.  A child may fear for their families lives if the abuser threatens them.</p>
<p>The issue of Roy Moore raises the question of why people didn\'t speak out earlier.  It is a good prompt for us to learn more about why victims might not speak out.</p>',

            This is not a research post, it's purely speculative and belongs in our speculative subverse,
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            . If you're going to make a post about why Moore wasn't reported, you first have to prove with links that he did something illegal. And given the mountain of evidence debunking these women's claim, I suggest you address that, too.
