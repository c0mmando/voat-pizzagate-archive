<p>I think the conclusion a lot of members on VOAT have come to is that the &quot;persona&quot; of Majestic Ape is played by both male and females. This is a VERY IMPORTANT distinction to make b/c it all relates to their Aleister Crowley and Marina Abramovic philosophy of Ancient Egyptian rituals related to Osiris/Isis/Horus (This makes sense b/c if we follow their philosophy stemming from the whole Egyptian &quot;fish and 14&quot; linked to Osiris and Iris who engenders her son Horus who at one time had no gender then we can clearly see they are replicating this ancient Egyptian ritual manifested in this act in their videos.)</p>
<p>In one of their sick music vids (I think the one titled &quot;I No Luv&quot; I don\'t remember exactly but I really don\'t want to go back and watch it b/c they are obviously using psychological and Neuro Linguistic Programming to influence viewers into their twisted thoughts)... It\'s the one where the nerdy guy with glasses is typing on the computer chat room at night and talking to Majestic Ape who appears to be the (trans or gender neutral one). By the end of the video the nerdy guy with glasses is placed where Majestic Ape was sitting and the original nerd guy is now wearing a bra and underwear signifying Majestic Ape\'s transformation on him. Regardless, every Heavy Breathing music video has the imagery of strangely focusing in on the penis and the suggestion of male - female duality. So keep John Podesta\'s &quot;fish and 14&quot; in mind.</p>
<p>It\'s the same thing played out over and over in all of their vids  in some shape or form and in a lot of the art work they reference on Instagram. </p>
<p>I can post images that prove my point concisely - Jerry Saltz (I\'ve already posted about how Jerry Saltz is in their inner circle who Jimmy Comet links to on instagram) who these sick fuks revere posts a ton of reference material with men and women having both the same gender and identity at the same time as in this artist (Ann Leda Shapiro) he links to (notice the obsession with the penis and a focus on it their art):</p>

<p>As you can see a lot of their art references this male-female duality that matches their link to the Ancient Egyptian myth of Osiris, Isis, and Horus.
This is what Majestic Ape\'s character is reflecting vis a vis Horus (Aleister Crowley said we are living in the Age of Horus, which is another hint to MA\'s role) not having a gender and being transmuted his gender by ISIS copulating with a dead Osris that was cut up into 14 pieces and resurrected back to life through ISIS\' magic (the penis was eaten by the fish, which describes their fascination with hot dogs and bizarre art with penises displayed everywhere as well as in their music videos). </p>
<p>Another Jerry Saltz insta post with hotdogs placed suggestively around the private area. If you didn\'t know, some people that follow this &quot;pedo cult&quot; actually believe in cutting off their penis and then making a special celebration about it and eating it... he titles it &quot;Stay cool kids&quot;.... he uses the word kids in this... it doesn\'t get any more blatantly obvious:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BJF2pyIhase/">https://www.instagram.com/p/BJF2pyIhase/</a></p>
<p>Watch this video made by Tracy Twyman from 2 mins to around 10 mins where she explains this bizarre phenomenon of real life people today that describe their journey of cutting (this is not the same as Bruce Jenner, this is different) off their penis and genitals and how it relates back to Osiris and Isis (where they symbolize the fish eating the penis of Osiris and then magically returning to Horus after Isis copulates with the Osiris\' dead body):</p>

<p>Now you understand the bizarre fascination they have with Majestic Ape performing at Comet Ping Pong. It\'s as if they are having a ritualistic event honoring their views, or whatever. The conclusion is clear and Podesta wouldn\'t have sent that &quot;fish and 14&quot; photo 3 times unless they have a reverence for that story which we see reflected in their instagram artwork posts.</p>',

            I was watching the Amanda "stand-up" at Comet Ping Pong and I started wondering who this Jerry was. Amanda mentions that "Jerry is here because he likes the world of sound" which prompts a person from the audience to shout "and little boys" and another to add "and little children" to which Amanda "jokingly" replies "I think that was his manager" and adding the now famous "well we all have our preferences" line.  Googling Jerry and Majestic Ape led me here and I believe you have identified this Jerry as likely being Jerry Saltz. I think this is very relevant and needs more investigating. And also, who is his "manager" that Amanda refers to?
           </p>
           <p>
            It is worth noting also that watching the full rant it seems clear they are celebrating Sasha Lord's birthday. This is who she refers to when she (or should I say he/she?) says "we are here to celebrate the birth of our lord and saviour". This is the event manager who likes to bring weird bands with satanic and pornographic themes such as Sex Stains, Death Valley Girls and Heavy Breathing to this friendly family restaurant.

             Very interesting correlations and thanks for shedding light onto their promoter... their website is clearly slanted towards Comet Ping Pong as "THE" venue for these weird bands to play at:

             There is an obviously common theme about these pedophiles and the people that are handlers/bundlers for rounding up children for the elites... they all work closely with children

              Of course, one question you might want to ask yourself is why is there an Egyptian obelisk, which is a tribute to the Egyptian "pagan" sun god Amen-Ra, in the middle of Vatican City?

               Redditz... Thanks again. From all my research it is very well known that the creators of most of these medieval obelisks were connected to Freemasons as was the DC obelisk... You are right that it does symbolize a phallus and that the circle around an Obelisk represents the vagina (it's easy to see this from an aerial Google earth view of any obelisk, they almost all have a circle around them whether made by stone and it represents copulation).
              </p>
              <p>
               But as far as the Zeitgeist video - I recommend you to be very skeptical of it as there are many simple observations the author states without resources and he states several fallacies such as horus having 12 disciples... this isn't true. The author of that video has an obvious grind with Christianity. Please explore the counter-evidence that sources all of its claims:

              There is a book in German, but I think its not translated in English. It is a cult of sadists which matches the prototype of an inter-generational satanic cult. Its really sick and the same scheme as other reports I have read about people in US. I dont want to go too far, but for example the moon is important in this religion, bcs there is a day person and a night person, or moonchild, and bad=good and pain=love. Its systematic growing psychopaths. And its about child raping and killing rituals.

               You've also got to read this account of a tortured child in a Catholic Church (sadly Catholicism is deeply implicated, no wonder)... it's almost word for word as you describe:

               That's probably who this piece of shit is about "werkinonmahnightcheese" (working on my night cheese)... He's a "night person"... He's linked in several Jimmy Comet instagram posts:

               And as you can see he does some sort of wood work and machine work for them. He also has a stupid mythologically influenced photo for his profile pic (a horned animal positioned in a way to make him look like some pan like creature).

                And that's why they have so many crescent moon (which is itself a satanic reference) and star references such as the Comet Ping Pong display sign at the store.

                 A crescent moon symbol is not on its own a Satanic reference.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  Pass the crescent rolls for Christmas dinner, please.

                  I never said on its own - I said crescent moon and star. I really don't want to go through the absolute abundant evidence proving my point on this but you can search google on this topic.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Why do you think 33rd degree Shriner Freemasons don a crescent moon and star with the arabic sword across their red fez hats? Do you know what event in history wearing that cap signifies? It signifies the rising up of Muslims in 890 AD in Morocco (a once Christian stronghold), and murdering 50,000 Christians in 1 day, then dipping their white fez caps in the blood of the Christians. Interesting that a bunch of Western white looking WASPs would don such a hat that represents the murdering of all those that are the basis of Western society.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But that's not my real point, the point is that the crescent moon and star are a direct reference to baphomet which is satanic.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You'll quickly find that Freemasons particularly hold this symbol dear in their symbologies:

               They have a book, a kind of bible, and what I saw again and again in the reports, they have a good cop, bad cop game. For example the parents are the bad cops, and the grandma is the good cop who shows love and tell you stories of the book and make you like and believe in the cult.

             It's relevant b/c now we know how to identify who is likely in their pedo ring by their posting to this sort of art and it helps you understand their motives and incentives for doing what they're doing. A lot of people have the opinion that these people are just perverted and twisted but they have a whole ideological perspective and not many people have made this connection about MA and how all their videos are obvious references to this ancient myth.

             Now we can look at future clues and connect them more readily into this framework of how they "think". Knowing how these savages think helps us get closer to exposing them as well.

             I also have a hunch that this is what they're likely one of the things they're doing at their private house address "art shows"... Marina Abramovic has all sorts of "human cake" photos where everyone partakes and eats the body just as the Youtube video I linked to in my OP references how some men cut off their penis and genitals then cook it and eat it (these things are related). They might be doing this to children as well.... Ritualistic cutting of children's private parts to early gods and goddesses has been around since Roman, Egyptian, and Chinese empires:

              The worst genital mutilation for boys was, of course, castration, which was practiced East and West both as a sacrificial rite to early goddesses (“Piles of freshly severed genitals lay beneath the altars in Egyptian temples”) and in order to prepare the boys for later rape by men. Eunuchs were popular for sexual use from Byzantium to Italy to China, with many areas famous as “eunuch factories,” and infants were often castrated “in the cradle” to be used in brothels. Parents who sent their boys to other households as servants, who were usually used sexually by them, often cut off their genitals and kept them in a jar.80 In the early Roman Empire “the castration of boys was a big business” used for raping by the aristocracy and by priests.81 The genital mutilation of boys is still so pervasive that some psychologists claim that little boys want their genitals cut—“because of an inborn vagina envy” (Bruno Bettleheim)—or because they are supposed to need to “feel grown up.”82

             James Shanahan has spoken about his witnessing of pedos cutting off children's private parts and how they were murdered and then eaten ritualistically that relates to this whole body eating cult which Abramovic often depicts in her works:
