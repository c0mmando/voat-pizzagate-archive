<p>Wexler was Epstein\'s &quot;mentor,&quot; and possibly his only financial client, which apparently raised some suspicions over the years. Wexler also possibly gave Epstein a mansion in New York that he rarely spent time in.</p>
<p>Wexler founded The Limited, which just closed all its stores, but apparently sold it some years ago. His company does still own Victoria\'s Secret, Bath and Body Works, and Pink, however (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L_Brands">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L_Brands</a> ).</p>
<p>Media stories on the New York mansion suggest that Epstein\'s taste was similar in many ways to the circle of the Podestas, Alefantis and Marina Abramovic, including statues of naked men and dog feces, and framed prosthetic eyeballs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2007, when model Maximilia Cordero filed suit against Epstein for statutory rape and sexual assault (the suit was later dismissed), her lawyer included a description of what has by now become a legendary piece of puerile decor in chez Epstein: &quot;[The] defendant gave plaintiff a tour of his mansion, showing her a huge crystal staircase with a huge crystal ball by the railing, ceiling chandeliers, a lounge room with red chairs, a statute [sic] of a dog with a statute [sic] of dog feces next to it&quot;...</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/9MX5F">http://archive.is/9MX5F</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from a Vanity Fair article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The entrance hall is decorated not with paintings but with row upon row of individually framed eyeballs; these, the owner tells people with relish, were imported from England, where they were made for injured soldiers. Next comes a marble foyer, which does have a painting, in the manner of Jean Dubuffet … but the host coyly refuses to tell visitors who painted it. In any case, guests are like pygmies next to the nearby twice-life-size sculpture of a naked African warrior.</p>
<p>...The office features a gilded desk (which Epstein tells people belonged to banker J. P. Morgan), 18th-century black lacquered Portuguese cabinets, and a nine-foot ebony Steinway “D” grand. On the desk, a paperback copy of the Marquis de Sade’s The Misfortunes of Virtue was recently spotted. Covering the floor, Epstein has explained, “is the largest Persian rug you’ll ever see in a private home—so big, it must have come from a mosque.” Amid such splendor, much of which reflects the work of the French decorator Alberto Pinto, who has worked for Jacques Chirac and the royal families of Jordan and Saudi Arabia, there is one particularly startling oddity: a stuffed black poodle, standing atop the grand piano. “No decorator would ever tell you to do that,” Epstein brags to visitors. “But I want people to think what it means to stuff a dog.” People can’t help but feel it’s Epstein’s way of saying that he always has the last word.</p>

<hr />
<p>The Epstein/Wexner mansion is profiled in &quot;Home Sweet Elsewhere,&quot; a 1996 New York Times article on properties owned by very wealthy people who spend little time in them (referred to in Curbed as &quot;pied-à-terre&quot; - literally &quot;foot on the ground&quot; - properties. David Geffen, Ronald O. Perelman, Steve Jobs and duty-free shop executive Robert W. Miller are also discussed.)</p>
<p>The New York Times article describes some oddities of the house when remodeled for Wexler, especially a bizarre bathroom. And apparently Bill Cosby lived across the street:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...When asked how long Mr. Wexner had occupied the property, Jeffrey Epstein, his protege and one of his financial advisers, replied, &quot;Les never spent more than two months there.&quot; Thus the prorated cost of Mr. Wexner\'s sejours would appear to have been in excess of a million dollars a day.</p>
<p>Visitors described a bathroom reminiscent of James Bond movies: hidden beneath a stairway, lined with lead to provide shelter from attack and supplied with closed-circuit television screens and a telephone, both concealed in a cabinet beneath the sink. The house also has a heated sidewalk, a luxurious provision that explains why, while snow blankets the rest of the Eastern Seaboard, the Wexner house (and Bill Cosby\'s house across the street) remains opulently snow-free, much to the delight of neighborhood dogs...</p>
<p>Reached in Florida last week, Mr. Epstein said that the house was now his.</p>

<hr />
<p>Not surprisingly Gawker speculated on whether or not there was some sort of sexual relationship between Epstein and Wexler:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monday\'s creepily gentle profile in the New York Times ( <a href="http://archive.is/nYlL5">http://archive.is/nYlL5</a> ) suggested that Epstein charged annual fees upward of $25m a year for &quot;superelite financial advice&quot;- leading Portfolio\'s Felix Salmon to remark on the profitability of private banking. Bullshit. Epstein\'s wealth is built on a &quot;bizarre relationship&quot; with single acknowledged client, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch creator Leslie Wexner, one of America\'s most successful retailers.</p>
<p>Now that loaded quote comes only from an unnamed Wall Street acquaintance of Epstein who spoke to New York magazine for a profile of the money manager in 2002. There is no evidence whatsoever that their relationship went beyond that of aide to mentor. Epstein is pretty obviously heterosexual, or else going to extreme lengths to prove the point. The Limited owner Wexner himself is married with four children. It\'s bizarre to imagine any romantic connection between two men who are now 70 and 55 years old, a right-wing Ohio tycoon and a sex offender.</p>

<p>Both the New York mansion and another property owned by Epstein in New Mexico are made of stone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From &quot;Every Property Owned by Sleazy Financier Jeffrey Epstein&quot; </p>
<p>...His portfolio also includes a <strong>&quot;stone fortress&quot;</strong> in New Mexico and the Herbert N. Straus Mansion in Manhattan, both of which are mentioned in the current round of allegations.</p>
<p>Often referred to as one of the largest townhouses in Manhattan—possessing 21,000 square feet and seven stories, 45,000 square feet and eight stories, or 50,000 square feet and nine stories, depending on who\'s describing it and when—the <strong>stone mansion</strong> at 9 East 71st Street was built in 1933. It was designed by society architect Horace Trumbauer for Herbert N. Straus, one of the heirs to the Macy\'s department store fortune, who died before it was completed.</p>
<p>In 1961, the mansion became home to the Birch Wathen School, which it remained until Leslie H. Wexner, the founding chairman of the Limited Inc., bought it in 1989 for $13.2M. Wexner hired architect Thierry Despont and interior designer John Stefanidis to help gut-renovate the 40-room home, showing it off in the December 1995 issue of Architectural Digest (sadly, the magazine\'s online archives don\'t go back that far). In 1996, the New York Times referred to the sumptuously decorated, expensively renovated pied-à-terre as the latest &quot;puzzling&quot; &quot;status symbol of the ultra rich,&quot; when it reported that Wexner never spent more than a few months in the home...</p>

            <strong>
             "stone fortress"
            </strong>
            in New Mexico and the Herbert N. Straus Mansion in Manhattan, both of which are mentioned in the current round of allegations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Often referred to as one of the largest townhouses in Manhattan—possessing 21,000 square feet and seven stories, 45,000 square feet and eight stories, or 50,000 square feet and nine stories, depending on who's describing it and when—the
            <strong>
             stone mansion
            </strong>
            at 9 East 71st Street was built in 1933. It was designed by society architect Horace Trumbauer for Herbert N. Straus, one of the heirs to the Macy's department store fortune, who died before it was completed.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1961, the mansion became home to the Birch Wathen School, which it remained until Leslie H. Wexner, the founding chairman of the Limited Inc., bought it in 1989 for $13.2M. Wexner hired architect Thierry Despont and interior designer John Stefanidis to help gut-renovate the 40-room home, showing it off in the December 1995 issue of Architectural Digest (sadly, the magazine's online archives don't go back that far). In 1996, the New York Times referred to the sumptuously decorated, expensively renovated pied-à-terre as the latest "puzzling" "status symbol of the ultra rich," when it reported that Wexner never spent more than a few months in the home...

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Shoppers in the Washington region were notified by e-mail that the Pentagon City store was closing. News outlets in places such as Indianapolis, Albany, N.Y., and central Illinois reported that their local Limited stores were shuttering.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sun Capital Partners, the company that owns The Limited, declined to comment.
            </p>
            <p>
             A spokesman told the Associated Press that the company will shut its stores by Sunday and that the closures would result in about 4,000 job cuts.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Limited was once a cornerstone of one of retailing’s most formidable empires. Founded in 1963 by Leslie H. “Les” Wexner, the store was a 2,000-square-foot box named for its limited assortment of women’s apparel.

             At least officially, Wexner has had no connection to The Limited for a number of years now. Sun Capital completely bought it out in 2010, IIRC.

            Great post, OP. Great comments, too.

           <p>
            That bit about Wexler owning Pink and Victoria's Secret... My daughter was on a competition dance team, and all the little girls wanting to be hip HAD to have Pink gear. They are basically campaigning to girls as young as 10 to be hot. Someone needs to start a meme campaign on this, especially given the relationship to Epstein.
