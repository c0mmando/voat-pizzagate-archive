<pre><code>&quot;Embattled Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has another decision to answer for: dining at the Vatican last year with a Catholic cardinal who was under investigation for multiple allegations of child sex abuse.

<p>Cardinal George Pell ate with Pruitt, top EPA policy adviser Samantha Dravis and EPA chief of staff Ryan Jackson on June 7, 2017, according to documents obtained by the Sierra Club, a progressive environmental group, through a Freedom Of Information Act demand.</p>
<p>Leonard Leo, a lawyer with the conservative Federalist Society, also attended the dinner. Leo has been instrumental in vetting and choosing federal court nominees for the Trump administration, including Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.</p>
<p>The five-star restaurant event was not on the EPA\'s official schedule for that day, but emails show the encounter with the high-profile accused pedophile was being planned for weeks.</p>

<p>Friday that the EPA was aware before Pruitt\'s trip that Pell had been under investigation for years but scheduled the get-together anyway.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump was asked Friday by a reporter during a White House meeting with auto executives whether he still has confidence in Pruitt.</p>
<p>\'Yes I do,\' he responded.</p>
<p>Pell, a 76-year-old cleric, faced a court magistrate on May 1 in his native Australia, pleading not guilty. There will be separate jury trials in two cases related to accusations of sexual misconduct in a swimming pool in the 1970s and at St. Patrick\'s Cathedral in Melbourne, Australia in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Pell\'s bail conditions require him to stay in Australia and give police 24 hours\' notice if he changes addresses. He is also forbidden to make any contact with prosecution witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>The details of the accusations against Pell have not been made public, but police have described the alleged incidents as \'historical\' – suggesting they are from decades ago.</strong></p>
<p>Documents released under a Freedom Of Information act request show Pruitt and his top aides had dinner with Pell and planned to tour the Apostolic Palace with him; the EPA chief\'s trip did include some environmental sightseeing, including a look at solar panels and the U.S.-installed air filtration system in the Sistine Chapel
It\'s unclear why Pruitt, a Southern Baptist, would risk public exposure of his meeting with Pell.</p>
<p>But <strong>the cardinal was in charge of the Vatican\'s finances,</strong> making him in effect the number-three official in the Holy See.</p>
<p>Pruitt\'s Vatican trip itinerary included other meetings with different pontifical officials.</p>
<p>It also mentions a tour of the Sistine Chapel – to examine its air filtration system, <strong>installed by the U.S. firm Carrier</strong> – and an up-close look at the Vatican\'s solar panels.</p>
<p>Pell is the highest ranking church leader to be publicly accused of child sex abuse.</p>
<p>The Vatican, a sovereign nation, does not have an extradition treaty with Australia. But Pope Francis granted him leave to return home voluntarily.</p>
<p>Before his elevation to cardinal, Pell was the archbishop of both Melbourne and Sydney.</p>
<p>In Melbourne he set up a special council in 1996 to address accusations of sexual misconduct with minors, but was widely criticized for providing little support to victims and limiting their individual compensation to $50,000.</p>
<p>Pruitt broke bread with Cardinal George Pell last year even though the EPA knew he was under investigation for child sex abuse
EPA chief of staff Ryan Jackson and top policy adviser Samantha Dravis also attended the five-star dinner
Pell is the highest-ranking Catholic cleric ever charged with sexually abusing children
The two cases for which he will face jury trials involve alleged incidents in a swimming pool and at a Catholic cathedral

            'Homosexuality – we're aware that it does exist,' Pell said in 1990. 'We believe such activity is wrong and we believe for the good of society it should not be encouraged.'

            So sex between two consenting men or consenting women he finds disgusting.  But sex between an adult male and a child, not so much.  This pretty much shows us who he is.

             Makes me wonder if Pell was the victim of a psyop to remove him because he was one of the few traditionalists left, ya'll trust Bergoglio?? that guy has blood on his hands for torturing and murdering priests in Argentina

             I wonder if the real pedophiles are falsely accusing those and murking the waters of those who do not participate by paying posers/actors crooks to lie 30 years afterward....falsely accuse those who are not doing of what you are doing,

              Oh no.  I don't ever give jorge bergoglio a pass on anything.  The fact is though, I tend to believe the Victims.  Also, when there have been slews and thousands of priests abusing children across the globe, I certainly could believe Pell is guilty.  Could there be a situation where a priest may be tarred and feathered for no reason.  Possible, but this case goes back decades.

               The problem is its always the progressive gay types, I know one who is old school he had a dust up with his 30 year old secretary he admitted it, got disciplined....etc. I have no doubt the infiltration has been massive, I was raised SBaptist we had a case were a very creepy guy molested a boy I knew...father beat the crap out of him in the 90's, just saying its culture/organized infiltration through masonry/leftism whatever the Bella Dodd stuff and it long ago nulified any discipline then open the flood gates.

             you haven't seen The archbishop, Vincenzo Paglia mural he had done in 2007

             In this case, there was not – in this sense – a sexual intention, but erotic, yes,” said Cinalli. “I think that the erotic aspect is the most notable among the people inside the nets.” He later added, “The one thing that they didn’t permit me to insert was the copulation of two people within this net where everything is permitted.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The reason he wasn’t allowed to be so explicit, says Cinalli, is that his painting had already done enough to demonstrate the notion that man has “freedom” in this life and even in the next, apparently to engage in whatever sexual behavior he deems appropriate. “The bishop and Fr. Leonardis . . . told me that they didn’t think it was necessary to arrive at that extreme to demonstrate the freedom that man, in reality, has in this world and in the next.”

            Wow.  That just blew me away.  The allegations, the police have said, will be historic.  There had better be a darn good excuse for Pruitt being in the company of such a vile pervert.

              Podesta wrote in his op-ed, “The mission of the Environmental Protection Agency has always been to protect human health and the environment. But since taking the helm just over a year ago, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has made no secret that his personal mission is to do the opposite.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Podesta can stick his hate for Pruitt you know where.  Lisa Jackson (aka Richard Windsor in JP emails) under Obama ignored many times the plea of the people living near the West Lake Landfill.  Children that have died from cancer and the horrid stench and leaching from the landfill.  As usual he is talking out of his rear.

            Well, isn't that interesting!  Either Pruitt went to send a message for POTUS or he's a plant.  Time will tell.
