             This is a very important point. I was raised in Hollywood. I was not into acting, but I lived near all the famous people, Betty Davis ( near our house), Bob Hope (down street from grand-ma), Enerst Borgnine ( across street from uncle). Most of the kids I went to school with were 'actors' things like wonderbread commercials.
            </p>
            <p>
             I was shown pictures of dick's 100's of times as a child around the schools and playgrounds and would always show no interest. The MO was always the same, they say "Can I show you something", then hand the stack, usually after I saw the photo's I would hand them back, no comment, and then make some excuse about needing the toilet, or being sick.
            </p>
            <p>
             I really think this is a key point of the child-fuckers, they really don't force themselves, they're really looking for willing participants. Later when I was a about 16 I had a friend much older say 28, he was cool to hang out with openly gay, on many occasions he ask me if I wanted 'play around', I told him 'not interested' that was that, never changed the relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
             I really think that most people attracted to kids are looking for 'willing' participants. I had a younger sister, say when I was ten she was 8, and she was frequently making $20 for letting the old guys ( &gt;60 ) around the neighborhood play with her genital, I never gave it much thought and never mentioned it to anyone. Thus I think there are some children who at young age see it as a biz transaction.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Getting back to Wikipedia, I think this is the typical NAMBLA MO,  you recruit willing participants and work the up to bigger activity's.
            </p>
            <p>
             My friend I mentioned above 28 and openly gay, on once occasion I asked him "How did you become Homo?", he said when he was in the military his CO took him alone and offered him a blow-job, that later the blow-jobs became more frequent, that later he was passed around the base for sex. Eventually he developed at preference for sex with males.
            </p>
            <p>
             NAMBLA/WIKIPEDIA seek to normalize beastiality and pedophilia. They say that SRA doesn't exist in the world ( Satanic Ritual Abuse of children ). Me thinks that WikiPedia is Scientology, e.g. CIA/MK-ULTRA

              There's a scene in DOUBT (film based on a play) where the mother is confronted about her child being sexually abused by a Priest.  She carefully says she's okay with it if that's what it takes to give her son an opportunity.   Same thing in PRECIOUS where the mother is okay with her man sexually abusing her daughter.
             </p>
             <p>
              There's a movement to lower the age of consent.   Treat the 'gay teens exploring their sexuality' as adults and allow sexual contact.

               It's relatively new innovation historically, the modern view on age of consent being around 16-18 in most countries globally. A hundred years or two ago our relatives married young.
              </p>

               They will sell this thing as a form of sexuality mark my words.
              </p>
              <p>
               Heterosexual, homosexual, pedosexual. And so on.
              </p>
              <p>
               Just read about sexuality in Polynesia and it seems to me that they saw no problems with what we now call pedophilia and sexual experimenting early on. Usually around puberty 9-11, when ever they were seemed mature enough and menstruation started. For boys it was when they could work men's jobs but they were taught to masturbate much earlier and sex education was hands on by an auntie etc.
              </p>
              <p>
               Perhaps it worked in that kind of culture as there was no force or violence involved. Our times are different and child protection laws are there for a reason.
              </p>
              <p>
               What tickles my curiosity is the fact that most pedophiles are heterosexual males who do find post-teen females sexually attractive. And very few were molested themselves..
              </p>
              <p>
               Every fifth fantasizes about younger ones according to some studies but the figures can be much higher, it's our culture that inhibits that kind of sexuality.
              </p>
              <p>
               Genuine pedos who get arousal only by minors is very rare.
