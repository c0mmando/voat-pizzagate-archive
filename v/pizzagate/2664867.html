<p>Excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Al Vernacchio made a TED talk called &quot;Let\'s talk about sex — and pizza.&quot; He\'s a professional sex education teacher for pre-pubescent children only - except for this TED talk about pizza... It\'s a very strange talk, and I found it very strange how obsessed he is with pizza - not just metaphorically - but the symbolism of pizza, as you can see from the pictures I scraped from his personal Facebook profile. I copied them because I figured he would make his profile private after since his strange TED talk hit the conspiracy subreddit. However, I cannot find any evidence that he\'s been looked into - and I really think he should. He strikes me as a sicko. Why is he so obsessed with an official slang symbol for pedophilia?</p>

<p>Earlier this year I posted about a controversy at Friends Central School in Philadelphia, where a Palestinian Quaker, Sa’ed Atshan, was invited to visit and speak, then abruptly disinvited &amp; the two teachers who invited him, Ariel Eure and Layla Helwa,  were suspended.   </p>
<p>The school set up a task force to consider how to handle issues around invitations to speakers. This task force has recommended  that a nearby university Dialogue Institute be “invited to work with students and teachers to promote ‘intrareligious, interreligious, and intercultural dialogue.’” </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But perhaps the most controversial presentation of all was by Philip Tromovitch, a professor at Doshisha University in Japan, who stated in a presentation on the “prevalence of paedophilia” that the “majority of men are probably paedophiles and hebephiles” and that “paedophilic interest is normal and natural in human males”.&quot; </p>
<p>Dr. Philip Tromovitch’s name pops up in this 1999 New York Times article. He is a <strong>UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA</strong> grad who coauthored a journal article advocating – you guessed it: trivializes the impact of child sexual abuse and condones pedophilia. </p>
<p>The journal article was written by Dr. Bruce Rind, an adjunct faculty member in the psychology department at <strong>Temple University</strong>, Dr. Robert Bauserman, an evaluation specialist working on AIDS prevention at the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and Philip Tromovitch, a graduate student at the <strong>University of Pennsylvania</strong>. The article, a statistical reanalysis of 59 studies of college students who said they were sexually abused in childhood, concluded that the effects of such abuse \'\'were neither pervasive nor typically intense, and that men reacted much less negatively than women.\'\' </p>
<p>The researchers also questioned the practice, common in many studies, of lumping all types of sexual abuse together. They argued that treating all forms of sexual abuse equally presents problems that, the researchers wrote, \'\'are perhaps most apparent when contrasting cases such as the repeated rape of a 5-year-old girl by her father and the willing sexual involvement of a mature 15-year-old adolescent boy with an unrelated adult.\'\'</p>
<p>In the first case, serious harm may result, Dr. Rind and his colleagues maintained, but the second case \'\'may represent only a violation of social norms with no implication for personal harm.\'\' The authors also suggested that the term \'\'adult-adolescent sex\'\' or \'\'adult-child sex\'\' be substituted, in some cases, for \'\'child sexual abuse.\'\'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember the recent post on the controversy in France over the rape case of an 11 year old leading to changes in the law on child rape which many child protection agencies are unhappy with?  Don\'t think they aren\'t preparing to do that in the US.  Who else is associated with the University of Pennsylvania?  Oh well, maybe it\'s just a cultural thing.</p>

Don't think they aren't preparing to do that in the US.  Who else is associated with the University of Pennsylvania?  Oh well, maybe it's just a cultural thing.

             One curriculum asks parents to refrain from teaching children about morality, as there are no right and wrong values, while another model curriculum asks parents to address contradictions in “religious approaches and rights based approaches.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Perhaps the most disturbing of the curricula asks parents to foster early sexual development by encouraging children to “experience genital pleasure” from birth until age 2 and by age 3, to encourage “sex play.”

             In 2009 the Canadian state of Ontario introduced its version of ‘Safe Schools’ as part of a broader education program called the “Inclusive Education Strategy“. Two of the primary architects of this program were the then Ontario Education Minister Kathleen Wynne (herself a lesbian) and the Deputy Education Minister Benjamin Levin.
            </p>
            <p>
             This program had students as young as six learning about “consent”, and 12-year-olds introduced to homosexual relations.
            </p>
            <p>
             In July 2013, Levin was arrested and charged on several counts, including counselling a ‘mother’ (who was really an undercover police officer) to rape her child, creating child pornography, and possessing child pornography. In 2015 he pled guilty to these charges, and was sentenced to three years prison.

             Lord Bertrand Russell joined with the Frankfurt School in their effort at mass social engineering and spilled the beans in his 1951 book, The Impact of Science on Society. He wrote:
             <em>
              ‘Physiology and psychology afford fields for scientific technique which still await development.’ The importance of mass psychology ‘has been enormously increased by the growth of modern methods of propaganda. Of these the most influential is what is called ‘education. The social psychologists of the future will have a number of classes of school children on whom they will try different methods of producing an unshakable conviction that snow is black. Various results will soon be arrived at.

              First, that the influence of home is obstructive. Second, that not much can be done unless indoctrination begins before the age of ten. Third, that verses set to music and repeatedly intoned are very effective. Fourth, that the opinion that snow is white must be held to show a morbid taste for eccentricity. But I anticipate. It is for future scientists to make these maxims precise and discover exactly how much it costs per head to make children believe that snow is black, and how much less it would cost to make them believe it is dark gray . When the technique has been perfected, every government that has been in charge of education for a generation will be able to control its subjects securely without the need of armies or policemen.”

            Vernacchio's pizza sex language was first published in a textbook in 2000.  The linked TED Talk
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF-CX9mAHPo">
             is from 2012
            </a>
            and was likely his first presentation of the pizza model to the general public.  Enthusiastically adopted by educators and people who like to talk about sex, it was apparently evolved by pedos into the code words in use today.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this Q &amp; A from his webpage, he tells how and when he got the idea:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "Q: How did you think up the pizza model?  What inspired you?
           </p>
           <p>
            A: The idea for making up a new model started when I began to realize how damaging the baseball model was.  Thinking up a new model took several years.  Each time I taught a human sexuality class, I would try to think of a different way to explain sexual activity that got away from the baseball model.  I don’t remember the exact year that I thought of the pizza model, but it was when I was teaching high school at St. Joe’s Prep (somewhere between 1986 and 1993).  In 2000 I was asked to write an article for a human sexuality college text book called Readings in Contemporary Sexuality.  This was where the pizza model was first published, although I’d been teaching it in classes for several years before that).  Since then it’s also been published as a lesson plan by the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) and will soon be added on the Scarleteen website."

             So this is the origin of using pizza sex language amongst pedos. And there are actually lesson plans about pizza as a metaphor for sex.
            </p>
            <p>
             No wonder there are references to pizza everywhere.  So that's the association for children.  This thing just gets sicker the more one digs.

              I don't like Mr. Vernacchio or his ideas, but how can we know that this is the origin of "pizza" as a pedophilic code word? We don't (at least I don't) know when "Cheese Pizza" became code for Child Pornography, so Vernacchio's use of "pizza" may have become before or after that.
             </p>
             <p>
              Either way, how can you prove a direct connection between the two uses of the word "pizza"? It still seems possible to me that this is a strange coincidence, although it is very suspicious and should not be ignored.

               I don't think this is the origin of the pizza code. I think it has been around longer than that and it was invented by pedos, and made its way into popular culture via celebrities. The guy is trying to cover up his own involvement by pretending he made it up to teach sex ed.

            Vernacchio teaches at friends central. Its just outside Philly near St. Joe's (Jesuit) University. I played lacrosse against them in hish school. We used to joke about how weird all their players/students were...most acted super emotional or gay. Not surprised this sicko could thrive there.
