            Something that has done the rounds is a conversation/contract between a Saudi rich man wanting women to service Saudis on a yacht. There is a discussion of money and what the men can do to the woman. She responds saying she's had her uterus removed so they can basically stick what they want up there.  I've heard that rich Saudi men do some really sick things to the women on their yachts. They shit and piss on them. That to me speaks to how much they hate women.

             Slang term is "porta-pottie." Common to stick fish up women too. Goal is to degrade American women like they see in the movies and on TV. Will always pay more for a young woman who's had a TV series, even if she's on a down slide. What do you think all of the sexy pictures in the Daily Mail are designed to do? Who do you think pays for PR campaign?

            criminals own the news papers? 
In 2004, Prince Nayef bin Fawwaz Al Shalaan was indicted in the United States and France for his involvement in a drug-dealing operation between South America and Europe. The scheme dates back to a love affair between the prince and a Colombian woman named Doris Mangeri at the University of Miami in the 1970s. They kept in touch and occasionally met over the years, with the prince even acting as a virtual surrogate father for her children. In 1998, the prince is alleged to have met with members of a Colombian drug syndicate introduced through Mangeri. The syndicate was headed by Juan Gabriel Usuga and Carlos Ramon, former brothers-in-law who had both lost an eye in accidents and were making millions in the drug trade. They shared a ranch outside Medellin, Colombia, which they called the Cyclops Cattle Ranch.
           </p>
           <p>
            The prince allegedly proposed smuggling cocaine on his private Boeing 727 jet, then laundering money through a bank he owned, Kanz Bank, “the only Islamic private bank in Geneva.” The prince has a history with drugs and was once indicted in Mississippi on narcotics charges in 1984. The Colombians agreed to his plan, and 2,000 kilograms (4,400 lb) of cocaine was smuggled into a stash house in Caracas via potato truck, then transferred into 100 empty Samsonite suitcases, and finally placed aboard the prince’s plane. Moved to a Paris stash house, some of the cocaine was then shipped off to Italy and Spain. Unluckily for the conspirators, the Paris stash house and a Spanish shipment were intercepted by authorities. As they squabbled over blame, the Colombians found themselves arrested in the United States....

            This is one Romeo and Juliet story that ended just as badly as the original. Princess Misha’al bint Fahd al Saud was in an arranged marriage (by all accounts, an unhappy one) with an older cousin. She left for Beirut to pursue further studies. There, she met Khaled, the son of a Saudi diplomat, and began an affair. They maintained the affair back in the kingdom and finally attempted to flee the country together in 1977, but they were caught before they got very far. The princess refused to simply denounce her lover and confessed to the adultery, enraging her conservative grandfather, Muhammad bin Abdul Aziz al Saud, brother of the king.
           </p>
           <p>
            She and her lover were taken to a parking lot in Jeddah, and 19-year-old Princess Misha’al was executed by a gunshot to the head while her lover watched. He would be dispatched by beheading, which was reportedly botched so badly that it took four strokes to complete. The Saudi authorities attempted to keep the whole affair quiet, but it caused international outcry in 1980 when it became the subject of a docu-drama entitled Death Of A Princess, broadcast on the BBC and PBS ...Prince 'forced male aide to FART in his face at drugs and hookers orgy' ... According to televised testimony by Princess Anoud al Fayez, one of the late King Abdullah’s numerous ex-wives, divorced by him several times, who now lives in the UK, King Abdullah kept the four daughters he had with her, Princesses Jawaher, Sahar, Hala, and Maha, under virtual house arrest in the Jeddah royal compound. They are said to have been under the control of three of their half-brothers for the past 14 years, a supposed punishment for racy lifestyles and criticism of the royal family. Others among the king’s daughters have had successful careers and even championed human rights, so why these four were singled out is something of a mystery.
           </p>
           <p>
            The women, now in their thirties and forties, are locked up under terrible conditions. In an interview with RT last year, Princesses Hala and Maha claimed that they were running out of food and water. In an interview with an Arabic TV network, the princesses said that they are being held as punishment for their stance on women’s rights and opposition to male guardianship over women. The Saudi authorities have never charged them with a crime and refer to it as a “private matter.”

            ...In 2010, Prince Saud bin Abdulaziz bin Nasir al Saud was arrested for beating his manservant and gay lover, Bandar Abdulaziz, to death in an expensive London hotel room. The death is said to have come after weeks of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of the prince. Finally, on Valentine’s Day, in a rage fueled by champagne and “sex on the beach” cocktails, Mr. Abdulaziz was beaten 37 times and bitten on both cheeks. He died as a result of his injuries.
           </p>
           <p>
            After the attack, the prince ordered glasses of milk and water, dragged the corpse into the bed, and tried to clean up the blood in a failed attempt to cover up his crime. The prince spent most of his trial trying to prove he was not gay, as homosexuality is punishable by execution in Saudi Arabia. However, one expert on Saudi Arabia noted that most executions for homosexuality in the kingdom were linked to rape charges, and as a member of the royal family, the prince was unlikely to suffer capital punishment. ...Saudi prince ‘snorted coke and had gay sex’ in the US

            Cocaine-crazed Saudi prince 'pleasured by a man after telling women they would be killed' ... In 2010, Prince Abdul Aziz bin Fahd was enjoying his opulent and carefree lifestyle at New York’s Plaza hotel. He was staying in a 370-square-meter (4,000 ft2) fourth-floor suite, while members of his entourage occupied 50 rooms in the Plaza and nearby hotels. The prince and his entourage had been staying at the Plaza, partially owned by a royal cousin, for four months when one of his men, Mustapha Ouanes, raped a young barmaid who had fallen asleep in his room. Mr. Ouanes, a mechanical engineer in the employ of construction and telecommunications company Saudi Ogere, was tasked with modifying the climate-control system in the prince’s suite to match his tastes.
           </p>
           <p>
            On January 26, 2010, Mr. Ouanes met a 26-year-old barmaid and her friend at a bar in the West Village; they shared drinks there and at another bar. The victim left to smoke hashish with another friend, and after she returned, the three went to Ouanes’s two-room suite to share breakfast. Incapacitated by alcohol and hashish, the two women passed out, only to awaken to discover Mr. Ouanes raping the victim. In the trial, the defense claimed that the women tried to make Ouanes pay them for sex, concocting a rape story for a lawsuit and cash payout only after he refused. ... In 1975, popular Saudi Arabian King Faisal (pictured above) was assassinated by his nephew, Prince Faisal Ibu Musaed. King Faisal had been known for his modernization drive, close ties with the United States, and support for pan-Islamism and conservative forces throughout the Arab world. On March 25, 1975, the king was sitting in his majlis, meaning “a place for sitting,” an event where the king opened up his residence to hear petitions from citizens. Outside, the prince chatted with Kuwaiti representatives, who were also waiting for an audience with the king. King Faisal emerged, and the prince rushed to embrace him, the king bending forward to kiss his nephew’s head as is Saudi custom. The prince then shot three times, hitting the king in the chin and the ear. A bodyguard then hit him with a sheathed sword as Oil Minister Zaki Yamani shouted at him not to kill the prince.
           </p>
           <p>
            The king was rushed to a hospital, where doctors massaged his heart and gave him a blood transfusion but could not successfully save him. It is said that the king’s dying wish was for the prince to be spared. The prince’s brother, Khalid, took the throne by agreement of the Saudi royal family, and the capital shut down completely for three days of mourning. Prince Faisal was declared insane, but a panel of Saudi medical experts determined that he was sane at the time of the assassination. He was found guilty of regicide by the high religious court and executed by beheading in a public square at the Al Hukm Palace (Palace of Justice) in Riyadh in front of thousands of onlookers.
