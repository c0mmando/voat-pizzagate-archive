<h1>Prosecutors ramp up foreign lobbying probe in New York</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Spinning off from the special counsel’s Russia probe, prosecutors are ramping up their investigation into foreign lobbying by two major Washington firms that did work for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The investigation had been quiet for months since special counsel Robert Mueller referred it to authorities in Manhattan because it fell outside his mandate of determining whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia.</p>
<p>But in a flurry of new activity, Justice Department prosecutors in the last several weeks have begun interviewing witnesses and contacting lawyers to schedule additional questioning related to the Podesta Group and Mercury Public Affairs, the people familiar with the inquiry said. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing work.</p>
<p>The New York work underscores the broad effects of Mueller’s investigation, extending well beyond the central question of President Donald Trump and collusion. Mueller has made clear he will not turn away if he discovers alleged crimes outside the scope of his inquiry; instead, he refers them out in investigations that may linger on even after the special counsel’s work concludes. Other Justice Department referrals from Mueller have ended in guilty pleas, including the hush money payment case of Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen.</p>
<p>The investigation reflects how Mueller, in latching onto an obscure law, has shined a light on high-dollar lobbying practices that have helped foreign governments find powerful allies and advocates in Washington. It’s a practice that has spanned both parties and enriched countless former government officials, who have leveraged their connections to influence American politics.</p>
<p>In New York, Mueller’s referral prompted a fresh look at the lobbying firms of Washington insiders Tony Podesta and Vin Weber, who have faced scrutiny for their decisions not to register as foreign agents for Ukrainian lobbying work directed by Manafort.</p>
<p>Podesta is a longtime Democratic operative whose brother, John Podesta, ran Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign; Weber is a former Republican congressman from Minnesota. Neither man has been charged with any crimes. Their firms have defended the decisions by saying they relied on the advice of outside attorneys.</p>
<p>Mueller’s referral also involved Greg Craig, a former White House counsel for President Barack Obama. Craig supervised a report authored on behalf of the Ukrainian government, and Mueller’s team has said Manafort helped Ukraine hide that it paid more than $4 million for the work. CNN reported in September that prosecutors were weighing charges against Craig.</p>
<p>It’s unclear if the renewed interest will produce charges or if prosecutors are merely following up on Mueller’s referral.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Weber and Craig and a spokeswoman for Podesta declined to comment. The U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan didn’t return an email seeking comment.</p>
<p>Mercury spokesman Michael McKeon said the firm has “always welcomed any inquiry since we acted appropriately at every step of the process, including hiring a top lawyer in Washington and following his advice. We’ll continue to cooperate as we have previously.”</p>
<p>Foreign lobbying work was central to Mueller’s case against Manafort and his longtime associate Rick Gates, two high-profile Trump campaign officials who pleaded guilty earlier this year and have been interviewed extensively by prosecutors.</p>
<p>The Podestas have been frequent targets of Trump and his associates, who have repeatedly demanded to know why Tony Podesta has not been arrested and charged. Trump confidant Roger Stone, for instance, has insisted a 2016 tweet of his that appeared to presage the release by WikiLeaks of John Podesta’s emails — “Trust me, it will soon the Podesta’s time in the barrel” — was instead a reference to the brothers’ foreign connections getting them into the hot seat.</p>
<p>In September, Manafort admitted to directing Mercury and the Podesta Group to lobby in the U.S. on behalf of a Ukrainian political party and Ukraine’s government, then led by President Viktor Yanukovych, Manafort’s longtime political patron.</p>
<p>While doing the lobbying, neither the Podesta Group nor Mercury registered as foreign agents under a U.S. law known as the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, which requires lobbyists to declare publicly if they represent foreign leaders, governments or their political parties.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has rarely prosecuted such cases, which carry up to five years in prison, but has taken a more aggressive tack lately.</p>
<p>To secretly fund the lobbying and to avoid registration with the Justice Department, Manafort said he along with unidentified “others” arranged for the firms to be hired by a Brussels-based nonprofit, the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, rather than the Ukrainian political interests directly.</p>
<p>Mercury and Podesta, which were paid a combined $2 million on the project, then registered under a less stringent lobbying law that doesn’t require as much public disclosure as FARA.</p>
<p>Both firms have said they registered under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, rather than FARA, on the advice of lawyers at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, Craig’s former firm.</p>
<p>Gates admitted in his plea deal that he lied to Mercury’s attorneys about the project, a fact the lobbying firm has publicly highlighted. The Podesta Group has said it was misled by the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, citing a written certification from the nonprofit stating it wasn’t directed or controlled by the Ukrainian Party of Regions, one of Manafort’s clients.</p>
<p>Both firms have since registered under FARA. But in court papers filed alongside Manafort’s plea agreement, Mueller’s prosecutors suggested the firms were aware they were working on Ukraine’s behalf.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say employees of both companies “referred to the client in ways that made clear they knew it was Ukraine.” One Mercury employee said the nonprofit was the client “in name only,” likening the situation to “Alice in Wonderland.” A Podesta employee referred to the nonprofit’s certification that it wasn’t related to the Ukrainian political party as a “fig leaf on a fig leaf.”</p>
<p>Mueller’s team also noted that “the head of” the Podesta Group, an apparent reference to Tony Podesta, told his team to think the president of Ukraine is the client.</p>

            I don't know what Mueller is up to. He has a history of giving light sentences to perpetrators of child porn. While a US Attorney in California, he gave a light sentence to David Asimov who was found with 4,000 videotapes of child porn. Asimov was given 6 months of house arrest in 2001 by Mueller. Let's hope that he prosecutes the Podestas for their crimes against children.

            Tony Podesta was not given immunity.  Tucker Carson had it completely wrong.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Washington Examiner article had it wrong too.  When Carson made his claim it was known that 5 people got immunity to testify against Manafort.  They updated the story with their names.......but none of the were Tony Podesta!  And they never changed that part of the article......the update disproved the entire premise of the article.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tony Podesta did not receive immunity.  The Democratic lobbying firm The Podesta Group and the Republican lobbying firm Mercury Public Affairs were part of Manafort's indictment but not named.....they were named generically like Lobbying Firm 1 and 2.  Mueller then passed the case off to another federal prosecutor to look into because neither of them had anything to do with the Russian investigation.  So this update today is just that that new prosecutor seems to be ready to go.  Mueller kept the Manafort investigation within the special counsel's office because Manafort ties into two other parts, the Trump Tower meeting when Manafort, Don Jr and Jared Kushner met with representatives of the Russian government and the Wikileaks/Roger Stone Angle.  Manafort has known Stone for almost 50 years and they both knew Trump for about 40.

               It was more directed towards Vindicator.  And it was because I genuinely didn't connect this FARA case to any campaign promise.

                   Funnily enough, if you look at the archive history for that article, you can see that the article originally only quoted a whinging tweet from Walter Shaub. CNN later edited the article to include whinging from Joe Biden, making this even somewhat pizzagate-relevant due to Biden's questionable behavior.

              <p>
               First of all, the US Attorney looking at Podesta has nothing to do with Trump.
              </p>
              <p>
               Secondly, I don't believe Trump actually cares anything at all about Draining the Swamp.  I will grant you that if you felt he was sincere, you might see this as a connection, but again, this case has nothing to do with Trump.  This case arises from an investigation Trump calls a witch hunt and has tried to shut down. This came out of an investigation into his own corrupt campaign manager, Paul Manafort, the guy who created the entire scheme, the Podesta Group and Mercury Public Affairs was involved in.  The Podesta Group and Mercury Public Affairs were hired by a think tank in Belgium, but it was a fake think tank set up by Paul Manafort to push the interest of his clients, Russian Oligarchs and the ruling party of Ukraine.  TPG and MPA getting indicted and facing charges will depend on if they knew the think tank was fake and they were actually working for Trump's corrupt future campaign manager, Paul Manafort.  If they knew, they are guilty.
              </p>
              <p>
               I have not heard Trump say how swampy and terrible his corrupt campaign manager is.
In fact, after a jury convicted him of 8 counts of tax fraud and bank fraud.  The president said it was "too bad" and "Paul Manafort is a good man" and that he felt "very sad."
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, it’s too bad. I feel badly for both. I must tell you that Paul Manafort is a good man. He was with Ronald Reagan. He was with a lot of different people over the years. And I feel very sad about that.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               And he went on to attack the prosecutor and the investigation that uncovered the crimes of his corrupt campaign manager.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                this is a witch hunt, and it’s a disgrace.

               Now Trump worked with this corrupt campaign manager since 1980.  He knew exactly what he was about.  He even lived in Trump Tower.  He knew exactly what he was when he hired him.  Paul Manafort and his partner Roger Stone who is Trump's friend and closest political advisor throughout his life invented the modern swamp

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Manafort had another idea to bounce off his two partners, Charlie Black and Roger Stone. ...They should be lobbyists, too....that one conversation, a chat among three ambitious young Reaganites — Stone was just 28 and Black only 33 — would have a transformative effect on the capital, nudging Washington into a generation-long evolution. Their business would morph into a then-unheard-of hybrid, a bipartisan firm that would help elect politicians — sometimes hedging by playing both sides in the same race — then lobby those same politicians. Radical, disruptive and frequently criticized as ethically unsavory at the time, the mix is de rigueur now.

              <p>
               “I don’t think they invented the swamp,” said John Donaldson, a veteran Washington strategist who was an early employee of the firm. “They invented an innovative way to navigate the swamp.”
              </p>
              <p>
               So no, I don't think Donald Trump who has worked with and hired Paul Manafort and Roger Stone for almost 4 decades gives a fig about the swamp.  And his administration shows he doesn't care whatsoever about ethics.
              </p>
              <p>
               For one, the fact he hasn't divested from his business which violates the Constitution.  The Constitution prohibits POTUS from profiting while in office from foreign or state governments.  A federal judge has just allowed subpoenas to go through in a lawsuit against the president.
              </p>
              <p>
               The following governments have stayed at Trump's properties. Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Bahrain, Azerbaijan, Turkey, China, India, Afghanistan and Qatar.  Saudi Arabia cancelled 500 rooms at a different hotel and switched to Trump's to curry favor.
              </p>
              <p>
               Over 100 executive branch officials and members of Congress have stayed at a Trump property.  Political special interest groups have spent over a million dollars with Trump in 2017. Trump spends most every weekend at a Trump property which is addition to publicity, causes the US government to spend money for rooms there for security and support staff.  Trump doubled prices at Mar-a-Lago, because now members can get face time with the President.  And now three Mar-a-Lago members including the head of Marvel Comics are running the Veterans Adminstration.  He also proclaimed it the Winter White House.
              </p>
              <p>
               Trump converts campaign donations into personal profit by having his campaign use his businesses and assets like his plane. This is why Trump started a 2020 campaign in 2017.  I think a million bucks flowed back to the Trump org so far this year.  And a campaign using Trump Tower for office space is ripping off its donors.
              </p>
              <p>
               And his whole administration is a swamp.  Scott Pruitt had like a dozen investigations into him before he was let go.
