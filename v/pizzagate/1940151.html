            Kendall Rae posted a bunch of videos about missing children as if she really cared, then said she was forced to take them down when her videos got de-monetized... so she asked for Patreon donations to keep her channel alive... then promoted her husband's channel... I've seen this script before...

              You sound a little excited so let me just say,there is some truth to your statement but what are the odds it is the real motive. A thought that comes to my mind is the issue, why would a person risk their money flow to discredited Pizagate? The first video may generate bucks but the harm to their reputation would have a negative long term monetary effect. Any video which makes light of child abuse is going to have a negative effect in the long run. So now we have 3 motives, 1 involvement, 2 paid to do it for nefarious reasons, 3 paid to do because their stupid greedy for quick Ytube bucks .

              A very real possibility and far more likely. Now to prove what the motive is. A damn near impossible task without boots on the ground. Then on to how does the information get used for good?

            I am entertaining another idea -- not that it was a hoax but a related thought -- seriously for the first time since I started this, months ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why?
           </p>
           <p>
            Seth Rich "murder" = HOAX  /
Deep state "intrigue" = HOAX  /
Congressional ballgame "shooting" = HOAX
           </p>
           <p>
            This all boils down to Wikileaks, doesn't it?  Had it not been for Wikileaks publishing the Pedosta emails, we would never have seen all the Alefantis/CPP stuff, right?
           </p>
           <p>
            Julian Assange has Rothschild connections, including sharing the same attorney.  JA's GF is wacko hep-C infected whore Pam Anderson, who was photographed at the "cannibal" dinner.  Any 09/11 truthers here?  Assange says that 09/11 was NOT an inside job.  Assange alluded that Seth Rich was source of DNC emails but never came out and said it.  Assange took part in a green-screen hoax with Sean Hannity where SH pretended to be interviewing JA from the Ecuadorian embassy.  You REALLY believe that Assange isn't part of this game?!  Pffft!!
           </p>
           <p>
            So, in light of the above, I no longer trust Assange. And if I don't trust Assange, I have to assume that he is in on playing us.
           </p>
           <p>
            I DO believe that JA is involved in child sex trafficking-- we all saw the Heavy Breathing videos,  etc.from years ago.  Also the Pegasus Museum stuff.  And, of course, CPP itself.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know that the "elite" pedo rings are real.  I'm a veteran of this crap and was around for Franklin.  BUT I think the info was leaked to us intentionally, for a reason.  And, as ReallyGraceful said, the motive behind it all was political.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, I don't believe our "researching" here will change one thing.  Look at Franklin -- nothing happened.  That point was countered here with, "Oh, but NOW we have the Internet!  Things are DIFFERENT now!"  Really!?  You're fooling yourselves.  The 'Net is just another medium, like the TV.  Most Americans still aren't aware of or interested in the subject of PG.  And you guys chase PHANTOMS because of BS put out by YouTubers et al about every other minute.  The "elites" are in control -- that has NOT changed.  You expect the "elites" to arrest themselves, try themselves, convict themselves, and incarcerate themselves?  LOL    Oh, and The Donald is in on this too.  You don't have Jew York as your home base and work in MODELING, BEAUTY PAGEANT, and ACTING industries without being involved in that stuff.  Don't you remember he used to WALK IN ON girls changing clothes at his beauty pageants?  Then there's his decades-long friendship with ROY COHN, the Jewish mafia CIA lawyer who was the "pedo ring kingpin."  Not to mention Jeffrey Epstein.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nothing of import -- sorry, but a bunch of low-level arrests, many of which (see CA pedo bust) that were already under investigation when Trump took office DO NOT COUNT -- has happened in the MONTHS we've been here.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only "deep state intrigue" is the BS they're spoonfeeding you to make you THINK they're doing something about it.  About HALF the narrative of the congressional baseball "shooting" is about that, so now they've got you chasing THOSE phantoms!
           </p>
           <p>
            So, I will continue to research what interests me, but I am changing tactics.  In fact, I'm starting something next week.  If it's successful (it will be), I will come back here to report and share so that others can do the same in their respective areas.

             I agree with you man. nice couple posts. pamela anderson is also a tranny, team tranny are the "bad guys". wikileaks also kind of promotes that david icke/alien agenda thing. hes not trustworthy to me and he gets too much attention for someone the establisment hates.
            </p>
            <p>
             but you get downvoted around here for bad mouthing assange. he only gave in on PG after the thing was blown up anyway. i think the seth rich thing is also fake for a couple reasons and my karma is in trouble now for saying so. it perpetuates the bullshit. sometimes people forget the magnitude and pervasiveness of whats going on right now. these guys dont stay on top bc they are idiots. they are one step ahead at least.

             It's obvious that the Clintons would murder a fucking leaker, and that the media has riled up the lunatic left-wing enough for the crazies of the group to kill people.

             </p>
             <p>
              It was stated in my post, but here I'll repeat it for ya:  SR "murder" was to FEED you idiots with the BELIEF of "deep state intrigue" BS, "Trump vs. evil Clinton."  Baseball game "shooting" was to convince you morons that there are "good guys" in Congress, "fighting the good fight" (specifically PG).  Baseball is also a MASONIC sport, so there is a lot of SYMBOLISM there, which indicates it may have been part of an occult RITUAL.
             </p>
             <p>
              "It's obvious that the Clintons would murder a fucking leaker, and that the media has riled up the lunatic left-wing enough for the crazies of the group to kill people."
             </p>
             <p>
              That Pedosta email was written FIVE MONTHS before Seth Rich's "murder."  Why'd the Clinton machine wait so long, with so much at stake?  Why'd SR stay in his JOB at the DNC for FIVE ADDITIONAL MONTHS, where he could CONTINUE TO LEAK?  Makes no sense.
             </p>
             <p>
              Not to mention there is ZERO hard evidence that SR was a/the "leaker."  Rod Wheeler proved to be FULL OF SHIT and had to backtrack his statements RE the "emails" between SR and Wikileaks.
