            Who knows what really happened Friday?
The whole thing looks fake --
People looking at the alleged White Supremacists think they're actors ... and look nothing like KKK.
And aren't they wearing out the "driving of cars and trucks into crowds" thing ...???
           </p>
           <p>
            Certainly if there were truly any anti-fascists there they wouldn't have been armed as they'd be standing
against the violence of the right wing, not imitating their violence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone remember the Koch Bros. Tea baggers arriving at Town Hall Meetings with rifles slug over their shoulders?
           </p>
           <p>
            Trust someone is researching Friday's events, but it feels as fake and as awkward as Sandy Hook.

            PG corrupt want civil war or any war. Both sides need to stay on core, as Rocka to Soros are shifting many countries to war and police states, simultaneously. Civil war that could be triggered over a statue, instead of demanding core rights in medical and economics and exposing corruption all weeded into the long history of PG.

            This association disturbs me, and is the most solid example of the fucked up twisted thinking the internet and right wing are foisting upon the masses.
           </p>
           <p>
            this is an entirely FALSE equivalency, and an obvious attempt to bring a subject that has NOTHING to do with pizzagate onto this forum!
           </p>
           <p>
            the investigation of crimes and citizen policing, as well as bringing a loaded gun into a private business for the purposes of intimidation, have nothing to do with citizen protests, free speech or any political stance.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is our duty as Americans to promote free speech and the free practice of peaceful demonstration. It is the basis of our constitution, along with the idea of equality among men. These principals ARE America.
           </p>
           <p>
            That being said, free speech does not preclude criminal penalty for unlawful speech. Thus the crimes of: perjury, false reporting, obstruction of justice, slander, harassing phone calls, intimidation and making threats, incitement to riot, and HATE SPEECH. These are criminal acts. 
The tiki march of wal-racists which occurred on the VA campus friday night was not permitted. it was clearly meant to intimidate. i grew up in the south, i know what torches and mobs at night means.... ever seen frankenstein?? yeah, it's a universally understood act, that is like the fucking opposite of christmas caroling! 
they surrounded a group of young college kids who simply believe in equality and kindness toward all people. surrounded them screaming with hundreds of torches. 
as for saturday, the ass-right went out of the permitted area, refused to use one entry point to their designated area, brought guns, and yes.... attacked people first, i have seen the videos. and yes, murdered a young white female in the street!! what the literal fuck???
           </p>
           <p>
            and you're crying because a fucking nazi caught a punch, was told racism is evil, and didn't get to do his little hitler parade? poor poor fascists. when you choose to intimidate and instigate violence you lose your right to free speech.
           </p>
           <p>
            It may be difficult for some of you to imagine someone acting purely out of compassion and justice for another, though if you are into pizzagate it shouldn't be. i have known many protestors, been to several colleges, protested myself, and live in a city full of activists. No one is paying liberal protestors, the idea is truely absurd. good and righteous causes do not need to 'recruit' this way, the persuasion is in the moral certainty of fighting for justice. 
Besides, obviously, if one were paying a side to incite a riot... you would pay the nazis!! duh
           </p>
           <p>
            the people actually getting paid to give opinions and influence our democracy are called Lobbyists and Corporations.
           </p>
           <p>
            oh yeah, that's also what America is- the defeator of fascism. remember that? maybe ask a veteran.
           </p>
           <p>
            and finally, please don't tell an oppressed minority they aren't WOKE - we invented the phrase.

               You pretend that the haters did not have a permit for their gathering.  They had a permit.  The antifa's haters showed up without the permit to cause violence.

                nope, clearly said they were out of the permitted area, did not abide the police request for one entrance into the permitted area, and then started violence randomly when asked to disperse by police.

             You are only talking about 'free speech' you agree with, right? The 'nazis' were spewing hate speech.  They had the 'right' to do that and I take  your comment that you agree with their right to free speech. right?  But, of course, you don't.   What right did the alt left  have to interfere with their permitted march and beat them up?  Where is that protected under the law?

              i protect anybody's right to stand on the corner and be an idiot. 
we often had street preachers and the like at colleges i attended. there are many people i do not agree with, you are very wrong, and i know you want it so bad to make your argument work, but it doesn't.
klan marches have gone on in towns around me all my life. get a permit, march, hold a sign, show your ugly face, even scream if you must. 
don't attack individuals, don't bring fire and guns, stay on the sidewalk or permitted area. all protestors have to follow these rules, plenty of good people- social and environmental justice advocates, get arrested every day for 'stepping off the sidewalk' , sitting down in a public building or trespassing on corporate property- peacefully!! 
running amok, inciting violence, attacking people in their own community, killing people. not acceptable, not protest, not peaceful.
             </p>
             <p>
              we the good people of the world have been ignoring the kooky klan and sad sack nazis for years, and we will continue to turn our backs on hate. go ahead, show your faces and your rhetoric. you still lose.

               No one has been ignoring the Nazis, who by the way learned their tactics from southern Democrats.  No one is ignoring the Klan, who by the way were founded by Southern Democrats.  Lots of Americans lost their lives defeating the Nazis  and fascists.    The group people are ignoring are the violent and hateful Antifa, Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter.  I think those violent groups were invited to the white house by Obama.  Apparently, some violence is approved.

              The fallout from the below video has been swift and severe. Over the last two days, one of the Democratic Party leaders caught on tape was fired and another resigned. But the admissions of violence and crime paid for by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign are so shocking and eye-opening, they may just propel Republican Donald Trump into the White House. And if there is a shred of legitimacy left in the Obama Justice Department, this video may send executives of the Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton campaign to prison.
The Democratic leaders caught on hidden camera admitting to widespread criminal activity include:
Bob Creamer – Founder of Democracy Partners, husband of Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL)
Scott Foval – National Director of Americans United for Change, Founder of the Foval Group
Aaron ‘Black’ Minter – Democratic National Committee, Democracy Partners
Zulema Rodriguez – Democratic Party

             Trust someone is investigating what actually happened Friday, but some are pointing out that the White Supremacists looked like actors and I'd just comment that any truly anti-fascists wouldn't be imitating the right wing by using violence to get their point across.  They would be making clear that they are against the violence of the right wing.

              Why do planned parenthood and black lives matter get to spew their hate speech?  You can't possibly agree with their speech which talks about actually killing human beings?  Planned Parenthood actually talks about selling human body parts!  Tell me you have more compassion for the victims than that.  Tell me you don't think that kind of speech should be considered free speech.

              <p>
               Throughout history we are presented with actual campaigns against GROUPS of people with
horrific results -- they're called propaganda campaigns and they have succeeded in causing great
harm to various groups of people who are NOT "white" and NOT "Elite."
              </p>
              <p>
               Jews -- Women - Homosexuals - Native People - Africans enslaved here -
              </p>
              <p>
               What was Segregation in the South run another 100 years after the end of the 
system of Slavery in the South, except as a propaganda campaign against African-Americans?
What do you think the message is of "Whites only" drinking fountains?
Or AA children being kept out of "Whites only" public schools in the South?
What of the harm done to Africans enslaved here over 250 years of Slavery which
also barred them from even learning to read or write.
What that suggests to me is that "whites" knew of the intelligence of the African and
feared it.  And they still do, including the greater physical strength of the African who 
are 15% larger than we are physically and obviously stronger and likely mentally stronger.
              </p>
              <p>
               What was the message to the world about the native people here....?
That they were gentle and kind and helpful to the invaders, or that they were filthy savages?
The violence being done to the native American by the invaders was hidden from the public 
and it was of the most brutal and cruel kind - cutting off of their hands, for one.
               <br/>
               And kidnapping their children ... which should sound familiar.
              </p>
              <p>
               Obviously the campaign against the Jews -- and all of these campaigns -- show the same patterns.
              </p>
              <p>
               How many kids in our schools are still be called "faggots" as a means of insulting one another?
How many likely homosexuals males and females have experienced depression because of 
the teachings of organized patriarchal religion which calls them "an abomination"?
How many of them have committed suicide because of bullying in their schools?
How many of them have been murdered because they are homosexual?
              </p>
              <p>
               And what of women whose societies were overturned by male violence?
And the hatred for women still be displayed in the propaganda of violent 
pornography easily available on the internet?
What of the Vatican's continuing to suggest that females are inferior to males,
including spiritually which is taught by the Catholic Church and the Mormon Church?
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Planned Parenthood has only followed LAWS approved by the GOP for "donations" of fetal tissue,
including recovering the "costs."
               </strong>
               Evidently you're not even aware that other private corporations also
involved in these "donations" which AGAIN ... are approved by the GOP.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Again -- the donating and use of fetal tissue was APPROVED by Republicans,
               </strong>
               including 
O'Connell ...** including the collection of "costs"** to cover the storage and transportation of 
the fetal tissue for research.
You're being lied to and you don't even realize it.  Find a new source of information.
              </p>
              <p>
               And in your delusion, also keep in mind that the
               <strong>
                "donation" has to be approved
               </strong>
               first by the
woman and/or her family.
              </p>
              <p>
               This lying video has been debunked -- and YOU are the victim of its lies.

                 Why would I have a problem criticizing organized patriarchal religions?
                </p>
                <p>
                 They have been nothing but a violence influence in the world over thousands of years -
and when they don't use armies, they use brainwashing of children.

            Yeah, now you know why the comments are disabled. Why don't they just say they want to get rid of anybody and anything that disagrees with this NWO BS. And do African-Americans really think things are going to change for them? Look at Chicago. No, better yet, look at the kids. Look at the kids and then make up your mind as to your wanting anything to do with this Soros-nightmare.

            This reminds me of It's A Wonderful Life. Remember when Jimmy Stewart is shown what would have happened without him? There's Pottersvlle, a debauched, perverted, gaudy, wretched place. That's our choice. Don't buy into the narrative or that's what we'll have.

             The Left isn't winning, they/we are being used by Deep State corporatists, similarly to the Republicans under Bush, to enact NWO war-state irreversible policies such as the TPP and the Patriot Act. I guess they discarded the empty husk of used up Conservatism after the complete discrediting of Bush and Family/cohorts to latch on to Obama, who was fully on board with that shit.

             This is delusion .... We have had nothing but the rise of the right wing since the end of WWII and beginning here with the McCarthy Era to force liberals out of government.
             <br/>
             And the fakery of the Cold War to aid the right wing and weapons manufacturers/MIC and intelligence.
And especially after the coup on JFK and our "people's" government by the right wing - Elites/MIC/CIA.
Add in the corrupting of our electoral system with hack-able computer voting which immediately began to deliver very odd and unbelievable right wing results and the fakery of the Nixon's "Southern Strategy" to cover up theft of our elections by computer.
             <br/>
             Americans have been voting on those hack-able computers for 50 years now.
            </p>
            <p>
             Operation Mockingbird was put in play two years before the end of WWII in order to destroy our free press, but mainly to keep them from reporting the truth of UFO's and JFK and everything since then.
Phil Graham was the social centerpiece and he moved other network heads to protect CIA lies and propaganda.  Corporations are right wing ... not liberal.  We have a CIA/corporate media.
            </p>
            <p>
             Police Force?  When they killed Kennedy in Dallas 50% of the police force there were KKK.
Likewise, when they killed Robert Kennedy in California, 50% of the police force there were John Birch'ers.
KKK and Birchers are not liberals.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh, poor little Trump who's finding it tough to make his way in the world?
Any chance that his attempts to overturn health care for millions of Americans has anything to do with it.
This afternoon, as I passed a GOP rep's office in our town, growing crowds were outside with posters protesting the overturning of existing health care -- and calling for National Health Care for All Americans as every other nation has.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, posters protesting Trump's racism and sexism ...
            </p>
            <p>
             And evidently you also think that the "Shadow Government" is liberal?
            </p>
            <p>
             Try for another source of information because the idea that you think that Hitler's NWO is something run by liberals is breathtakingly inane.

             You missed another big one. The financing of extremist groups sowing chaos and discontentment for the masses. The overall changing of peoples perception of reality. Not a big fan of Trump, but I do believe they see him as a threat to their goal. I also believe that he may have put a kink in their plans.

              I was not a big fan of his either, but I voted for him to keep Hillary out..... I am hoping I misjudged him because, he seems to be fighting for us so far, everyone is hammering him but, he keeps pushing back..... and yes he has put a kink in their plans I agree.....

               Same here. I knew enough about HC to know not to go there. Thought about voting Johnson until I heard his VP endorsing her right before the election. I knew then he was one of them too.

            We need to come together. For those that are asleep we must wake them and be prepared to stand strong. Once you look evil in the eye you gain courage. There are a lot of courageous citizens in Voat pizzagate who refuse to give up on these children and turn our backs as a country again.....it is time.

            The hypocrisy is palpable.  Either you stand up for freedom of speech where it does not impinge on other's rights or you don't.  Violence should be condemned and not encouraged no matter how much you hate the speech of others.

             Peaceful Protests  Say So Much More Than Violence.  After the Mayhem the original cause is mostly forgotten and the news becomes more about the slaughter and violence.  Nothing is accomplished except further division of the groups.  That is their goal.

              And of course real anti-fascists know that -- 
they don't run around with clubs and do violence in order to protest the violence of White Supremacists!

               Yes, I agree.  I also think there may be more to come.  I am hoping people will start getting the drift of what is going on.  There is stuff opening up now on the internet.  Let's keep our fingers crossed, if people wake up about this, it may all fall into place.  I think they are pushing the envelope.

But all of it seems very odd.

                 Yeah, well I think we know it was not as reported.  I am wondering if there were people really taken to hospitals and jails or was that part fake as well.  Were they taken to another place if they were the "crisis actors"?  How do we know?  And the Mother of Heyer sheds not one tear on any of her TV spots, the father either.  Granted sometimes people get so angry they look death in the face and act differently but not just once did they cry or not a cracked voice.  So Fake.

                  It will probably take a while before we really know as it takes time to do these investigations.
Sadly that only benefits those who may have created yet one more "false flag" event.

                  That struck me as well. They are not acting like the parents of a freshly departed child at all, and the whole purple-wearing funeral thing was creepy too.

                   When are people going to wake up?  It is so obvious if you are awake, I guess.  They need to research and not believe everything right in front of their TV.

              Peaceful Protest yes, but the problem is the Soros left will bring in their agitators disguised as peaceful protesters and, the leftest media will turn it into a violent protest on every channel.

                Good article bopper, Thanks, not surprised, that is what Soros does well and, the media is more then happy to assist in making legit groups look like crazed Nazi's....especially anyone who does not worship Hillary and her minions.

                Thank you for that link.  I have been hoping someone would find a company or info about these bad actors.  They even provide Flash Mobs?  WTH is that?  The end of the article says something like this: if your cause is worthy of protest then why do you need to pay $25 per hour? Exactly.

                 Flash Mobs are people who go into stores like malls, convenience stores etc, and fill their pockets, bags, etc with goods as fast as they can and, leave in a flash without paying for it....most are teenagers to young adults.

                  I agree with this as I've seen it with my own eyes, however, "Flash Mob" has another less nefarious meaning where people get together all at once and do a synchronized dance without telling other people in the mall/area.

                  I know, I thought that was shocking, but that is what it said in the Zero Hedge article. So what is "Crowds on Demand?"  According to their own website, they're in the business of sourcing large crowds of people to "provide clients with protests, rallies, [and] flash-mobs" all over the country.  They even have an entire page on their website dedicated to "Protests and Rallies."  This is horrible if that is true.  Flash Mobs? Really.

                   It is probably a Sorus funded group, also if you google flash mobs attack clothing store I am sure the articles are still on the internet, several of them caught on security cameras, there were several last year shown on the news.

                    Yes I know what they are, I am trying to say that that is really horrible.  What is the purpose of them?  It is bad that they, Soros and his cohorts are preying upon young people to take part in this kind of mayhem.  I know that some are doing it for other reasons, but let's face it, many need the money.  Despicable.

                     I believe the purpose of them is to cause unrest, chaos, and anarchy, all the things happening are to undermine the USA anyway they can....the lefts banner cry is 'With Chaos comes Order'.....and they will control that order is what they are striving for, the New World Order.......that is what tearing all our history down is about, our monuments, yes terrible things happened in the past, but we strive to be better, but you don't erase our past, you learn from it, the Taliban blows up monuments, now we have a minister in Chicago that wants to tear down a monument of Washington, and rename a Park that is named after him, it is crazy but it is all pointing to one goal, the downfall of America.....as Khrushchev said back in the 60s......America will be destroyed from within......this is the beginning of that historical quote.

                  I think some of them are older and do not know the power of the internet.  How else could they be so dumb?  It is almost comical.  I am waiting for someone to out some of the actors. We have a lot of really smart people on the internet.

               Then rules must be enforced.  If they want to protest they must have a permit.  Otherwise they must be arrested.  Whichever side.

                At what point did we accept the "rule" that people need a quite-possibly-denied-permit to protest? Could that be a part of this mess, solidifying that Deep State desire?

                 Idk, how we solve this, but in Europe people get out in the streets by the thousands.  They protested the TPP in Germany with thousaands and I bet they did not have to have permits.  The problem is over here, if we did not have permits, with the media being in their pockets, they could quickly turn anything into a horrible mass pandemonium event.  It seems that does not happen over there, or maybe I am mistaken, but have not heard of it.  I still think all those people that did not have a permit to be there should have been immediately arrested.  But we now know what they were not.

                Yes, but unfortunately lawlessness now days is rewarded......and the left does not care about the law, they only want to make those who respect the law look bad so, they join the protest with evil intentions, and a permit means nothing to an anarchist....and what police do you trust, look at the DC police who can you trust there....to many cockroaches have invaded the house.....and then you have the leftist media reporting everyone in the protest were Nazi's because, they are in the business of making law abiding citizens look bad as well.

                 I do agree with what you are saying, I just abhor violence.  There are many obstacles put forth by the New Community Policing and with Antifa and Soros and they know how to play this game because they have been playing it for decades. There are people on both sides speaking out against Trump so it is hard to point fingers at the other side.  It is hard to convince people there is something rotten with these groups when both parties are out to take him down.  I did not vote for Trump but I am willing to give him a chance.  I don't like what is happening either. I am watching Heather Heyer's mother on TV give the eulogy and I want to slap her.  She is a fake and a well paid fake I am sure.

                  I understand what you are saying and, how you feel, I did vote for Trump because the thought of Hillary winning scared the heck out of me!......I know there is bad on both sides, but when it comes to keeping score as to who has the most points at causing chaos and rioting the left wins hands down.

                   I am sad to say that there are people in the Dem. Party that are controlling these horrible groups and I do agree they have the upper hand.  The Antifa and BLM are shameful and are playing a horrible trick on their Dem supporters. Those that are not awake.
