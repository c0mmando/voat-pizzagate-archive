            Think a good attempt at trying to inform families but perhaps wrong to make it a children's book.
Should be more directed to parents.  But very much hope that parents are more alert these days
to changes in children's behavior.  And that includes older children, as well:  Was watching "Speak"
today which is about a young girl leaving 8th grade and raped at a party celebration.  Effects at the
least her entire first year of high school where she barely speaks all during that year and never tells
anyone -- her parents, nor friends, nor professionals -- about what happened to her.

            The article again tries to proclaim that all SRA cases in the 80s were "covered up" and that none of them were bullshit. Folks, if you can't look at the evidence in many of those cases, as well as the later testimony of so many involved with them, and conclude that at least SOME of the cases were bullshit for various reasons, you shouldn't be part of pizzagate investigation. The investigation's purpose is to produce EVIDENCE of criminal conduct. There is not enough EVIDENCE to corroborate our speculation yet. We need more.
           </p>
           <p>
            And this same kind of EVIDENCE is what made cases like McMartin and Kern County come out as they did: windows into the incompetence, corruption and malice that drives many criminal investigations within law enforcement. Yes, sometimes police, like all human beings, are lazy, manipulative, and deceptive. Sometimes they are willing to let innocent people rot in prison rather than admit they fucked up. I really doubt anyone of conscience these days can argue that all police are noble people. Some are criminal filth and deserve to be locked up with the animals they hunt.
           </p>
           <p>
            So please...if you're going to pursue evidence of criminal activity, don't ignore the lack of evidence or evidence of corruption when it shows up regarding child abuse. Some cops will manipulate people into saying whatever they want to look like a hero, including children. Certainly, if and when the day comes when actual smoking guns are discovered, we'll find that at least some of the people involved in pizzagate were just dupes. Not everything is calculated and intelligent. A lot of crime is accomplished by criminals taking advantages of broken systems and stupid people. Sometimes those criminals have badges.

            <p>
             Problem isn't a lack of evidence -- problem is the sidelining and stopping of investigations once they reach the level that pizzagate reached, where names are being named and connected.
            </p>
            <p>
             In an interview with Prof. Jim Fetzer, NYPD Detective Jim Rothstein made all of this clear, as well as he relates 50 years of investigations into pedophile rings and how the investigations are stopped as they reach the point of naming names of higher ups involved.
            </p>
            <p>
             In discussing pizzagate . . . 
 Detective Rothstein is making clear that *WATERGATE was also not only about prostitution rings being run by the Democratic Party, but also about pedophile rings.  And that a "book" recording this information was at the DNC/Watergate building *which seems to be once cause for the break in.LBJ and Bobby Bakker were running prostitution rings in order to entrap members of Congress.   Hotel rooms were set up where women of the night/day were provided to lure members of Congress.

             It's also impossible to deny the reality of the tunnels and other evidence that Gunderson found.
And 800 witnesses.

              I don't know what either of these comments you've made have to do with SRA cases in the 80s such as Kern County which are objectively cases of police misconduct. Not all sensationalized cases of child abuse were based on valid accusations. Some probably were, but some definitely were not.

               Pizzagate is about Satanic Ritual Abuse --
So were many of the investigations that

                Detective Jim Rothstein
                <strong>

                Pizzagate.
               </strong>
               And -- 
Have you actually ever read Gunderson's investigation of the McMartin case?
It included Satanic Ritual Abuse.

             Lack of evidence isn't the problem.  Problem is investigations being sidelined or stopped when police get close to names of higher-ups . . .  as Detective Jim Rothstein/NYPD is telling us in regard to their 50 years of investigations and stopped three times!  One had gone as far as NY State hearings.
