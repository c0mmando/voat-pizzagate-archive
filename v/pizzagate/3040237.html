<p>The guy in the jacket was first photographed on January 23, 2019 (day of reported fire.) Currently there are two other sightings of a guy in a jacket (reportedly the jacket looks like the one from Jan. 23).

The next day, the guy in a jacket is seen a THIRD TIME after returning to the forbidden Washington monument on February 5.  Even though the events took place in the DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, the jacket-guy is called a &quot;CALIFORNIA MAN.&quot;  No mention is made regarding his D.C. location. WHY? Did he have any friends, family, or co-workers in D.C.? Why was he there? How long?</p>
<p>January 23 to February 5 is about TWO WEEKS. Where did he live during that time? CALIFORNIA? Wearing the &quot;same&quot; jacket? OR Was he hanging out with that drum beating Native American guy in his Washington Mall teepee?  Homeless?  No one is talking about this.

            I too thought it was strange that he wasn't charged and trying to arrange for his bail after the Stay Away order. REALLY?  You could be right and they are just throwing that same jacket on different guys.  Many would assume it's the same person.  After all its been on MSM.

            The Washington Post reports:    The article isn't what I want you to focus on.  Its the words Washington Post.  Who owns the Post?  Uh huh. Jeff Bezos.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Heavy article stated that there was a head shot of Ryan on IMDb.  Who owns IMDb?  Jeff Bezos
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb
            </a>
            In 1998, Jeff Bezos, founder, owner, and CEO of Amazon.com, struck a deal with Needham and other principal shareholders to buy IMDb outright for approximately $55 million[9] and attach it to Amazon as a subsidiary, private company.[10] This gave IMDb the ability to pay the shareholders salaries for their work, while Amazon.com would be able to use IMDb as an advertising resource for selling DVDs and videotapes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is it possible there could be a collaboration here between Bezos and whoever is behind this Whole Farce?

             Wow! Good research. I didn't know Bezos owned IMDb. I saw the alleged phone video of the BRAWL between Ryan and the Park Police. This guy is still alive? He wasn't booked? Obviously something is up.
