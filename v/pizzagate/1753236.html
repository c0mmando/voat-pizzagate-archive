<p>[Pizzagaters believe that] Hillary Clinton and her top aides were running a child-trafficking ring out of a Washington pizza parlor&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The false narrative was created by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/technology/fact-check-this-pizzeria-is-not-a-child-trafficking-site.html">New York Times\' Cecilia Kang, November 21. 2016</a> where she characterized the pizzagate theory as such, apparently based solely on messages supposedly posted to James\' Instagram feed. &quot;All of them&quot; said Comet was the base of a child abuse ring &quot;led by&quot; Hillary Clinton and Podesta. </p>

<p>In his recent charade, Alex Jones posits himself as the voice of the pizzagate investigation, taking responsibility for &quot;creating the false narrative&quot; <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C8CNE7SVAAAfnzA.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C8CNE7SVAAAfnzA.jpg</a></p>
<p>In his well-covered video, Alex said \'we all ran over to Comet, looking into this innocent pizza place, instead of looking at the real perps [Weiner, Epstein, etc]\'.</p>
<hr />
<p>I am asking the crowd here whether my observations of our pizzagate investigation are correct. What I have observed is a large group of serious, intelligent, caring people of all age groups and from all backgrounds, looking into any obvious (and many not at all obvious) leads that have come from the Podesta leaked emails, and from mainstream media (such as the Silsby/Clinton/33 children evidence).</p>
<p>I have NOT observed any serious bias towards Alefantis in lieu of other leads, like the ones Alex Jones <a href="https://youtu.be/EbXbtt25jGg?t=9m20s">and now Mike Cernovich</a> \'advise\' we focus on. </p>
<p>People who are running with the false, MSM-derived narrative which defines pizzagate as a belief that Hillary ran a sex slave ring out of the basement of Comet Pizza, are doing so in error and in defiance of the facts.</p>
<p>At the time of her article, I was unable to find anything to back up Cecilia Kang\'s assertion that our group believed what she claimed. I had read virtually every pizzagate-related blog post, every thread on the various subs, and had my ear to the ground on other forums up to that point, and her definition of our movement was completely novel to me. NO WHERE was our group claiming this shit. </p>
<p>We <em>did</em> ask obvious questions that were related to <em>anything</em> that came up in those emails, though James\' Instagram provided a lot of fodder for our investigation to be sure, but we did not <em>focus</em> on Comet as Alex suggests. </p>
<p>Claims that we have focused on Comet, and ignored other leads and locations, and that we were led astray, and that we believe something crazy about Comet\'s basement &amp; Hillary are all <strong>Fake News</strong>.</p>
<p>Anyone promulgating these claims and not correcting them (<em>perhaps tweeting <a href="https://voat.co/user/ceciliakang">@ceciliakang</a> with requests for some kind of reliable source for her article... did she even see the Insta messages? did she make sure they were from real people? did she look on other forums as well, to gauge the opinions of pizzagaters?</em>), is on the wrong side of this thing and doing this investigation a great disservice.</p>
<p>The actual origin of pizzagate is being virtually erased by allowing the NYT, and alt media icons, to create fake news and effectively smear us in the process.</p>
<p>We need to get back to our roots. Look at what they are trying to hide, and GO THERE. I also think we should make a lot of noise about this Fake News from the NYT/AlexJones so that it cannot continue, and so that the public is made aware simultaneously of what they are <em>not</em> saying, made aware of what pizzagate really is.</p>
<p>The media, and now alt media aren\'t addressing the emails, the use of code, the donations to Comet by Soros and Clinton, Alefantis calling babies &quot;hotards&quot;, Alefantis threatening Ryan\'s life, Alefantis saying he doesn\'t like children at all, yet is <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1480742">taking a baby to &quot;the farm&quot;</a>.</p>

            So, if i have this correct, we STILL don't have any source for the NYT's definition. The NYT gives only "Instagram comments" made to JA.
           </p>
           <p>
            OK, this is what i wanted to know. When i don't have a good idea of how to proceed i just wait til one comes. The goal would be to expose the fake news source, then to correct it. I DID see this meme on twitter - not a bad start but still a bit wordy for red pilling?

            As Maureen Dowd wrote long ago, the thing you need to know about th3 Clintons is that the charges were plausible.

            I'd be shocked if they + the others didn't have sex parties in a number of DC locales over the years.  That they are both sexual deviants is well acknowledged -- as is bills friendship with pedophile Epstein.  In a sane world, like I imagine Montana or North Dakota is, alefantis' homosexuality and art choices + Podesta friend would be nail in the baby sized coffin

            Megyn Kelly did the same thing. Basically, Trump supporters created this fake meme of Hillary traficking children from the basement of Comet Ping Pong! I don't know how this can appeal to anyone past 5th grade education!

            Hold up. Couple of things on your "evidence" summary:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Alefantis calling babies "hotards" "
           </p>
           <p>
            Go back and look at the original photo. JA was called a hotard by one of the commenters, and he called them hotard back. (Plenty other shady photos, though, not so easily dismissed, including "chickenlovers".)
           </p>
           <p>
            "the use of code"
           </p>
           <p>
            Where there ARE things in the emails likely to be code, the black and white definitions aren't quite accurate (black partially, white not at all). Here's an actual "hanky code" list if you wish to go this route (copy/paste link line since clicking doesn't work right).
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://user.xmission.com/">
             https://user.xmission.com/
            </a>
            ~trevin/hanky.html
           </p>
           <p>
            But you're spot on about how MSM has defined PG falsely. They created a strawman that everyone now likes to tip over to prove we're just fools who believe "fake news".

            We are being gas lit and called stupid.  They are MAD because they have completely lost the ability to control "what we think" with the MSM.  We have every right to focus on whatever we see fit!  This is an investigation.  One that frankly should have been done by journalists and law enforcement -but is NOT so it is up to us.  This is not a top down thing.  Pick off (Alex Jones) or have in fighting (Seaman/Frost) with the leaders - don't care.  Those Haitian kids that Silsby was trying to steal THEIR lives matter.  This is world wide. This is the worst kind of evil.  This is speaking truth to power.   FUCK EM!  Keep on trucking.

             No one is surprised the NYT stepped up to defend pedos, this is more about holding their feet to the fire and a call to action - demanding that anyone who furthers this fake news CITE THEIR SOURCE. And if it's MSM, show them that all MSM stories about pizzagate refer to the NYT initial definition which was based on some supposed Instagram comments!!!

            The "hotard" thing is a mistaken interpretation.  JA and a friend were calling each other that, not calling the baby in the picture that.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also am not sure about Alefantis vs. Ryan.  I'm skeptical about anything which I can't observe, and I can't observe the phone call(s) Ryan claims happened.  The rest could be faked and he could be working with JA, for all I know.  I'm not at all saying I think that's true, just that I have no way to be sure what is true there, so I'm withholding judgement and, as a result of my uncertainty, I don't push that storyline.
           </p>
           <p>
            Aside from those criticisms, I absolutely love this posting and you are 100% on target with the gist of it.  I wish I could give it a few more upvoats.

             Thanks! On what do you base the claim that hotard was in reference to an adult?
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, Ryan has pretty well vetted the claims of the death threats

              If you look at the IG page, you'll see that Alefantis posted something, then later a friend of Alefantis says Alefantis is "becoming my favorite hashtag #hotard".  Then in the next comment, Alefantis says simply "#hotard".  So his posting of that word was prompted by his friend's usage of it first.  They are taking friendly jabs at each other.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is how anybody sympathetic to JA will interpret that page, and I believe it is what actually happened.  Even if I'm wrong, it's not a good item to push, because skeptics will dismiss it.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is an example of why we are having trouble making progress: we need good quality control, and we don't have it.  So a lot of weak -- and even false -- stuff circulates longer than it should.  The villains use that as a weak point to attack us over, but that doesn't mean we should stop investigating, it just means we have something we need to improve on.

               You had me until the last paragraph. I haven't seen example of "a lot" of false info. I also wonder why you are the first person Ive seen correct the accepted interpretation of that IG hashtag. Would yo u insider making a standalone post about this? No one wants to be working under false assumptions, and I think we need to hash this out and get on the same page. I have heard from Alex Jones and now from you that we have a lot of falsities in our investigation. What other examples are you thinking of?

                The #hotard thing has been discussed a few times before.  I might have been the first one to go into detail; I can dig up that post if a search feature is kind today.  :-)
               </p>
               <p>
                Other examples of bad info: whether or not "James Alefantis" is his real name; whether or not it sounds like the French for "I love children"; that the pic of drag queen "MsSummerCamp" on the CPP floor is actually Alefantis; that the digging up of the dirt floor in a couple of photos was digging trenches; whether or not Alefantis took the photo of Obama playing ping pong in the White House.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm not including the idea that the photo was of Obama playing ping pong at CPP, because (thankfully) that obviously retarded idea never really caught on, but at least one person apparently thought it was so at some point (and in a move which should surprise nobody, the media used THAT in one of their shitty hit pieces on us).
               </p>
               <p>
                The items I listed which are ambiguous are examples where we have people believing both ways; whichever answer is correct, a portion of the PG community must, logically, be wrong.
               </p>
               <p>
                There are more examples, but I think that should suffice to make the point.  Despite many efforts to "correct the record" (argh... damn Brock fagging up that perfectly useful phrase), some errors persist among at least some of us.  Also, when assertions are made that PG researchers think X, it's a challenge to disprove that without some central resource to look it up.  The lack of central authority is both a strength and a weakness for us, leading to articles like this one you wrote, drawing on your own knowledge (which I attest is correct from my own similar knowledge) to gainsay false allegations.  I'd love for it to be seen by everyone, but we don't have newspapers and media megaliths at our disposal to make that happen, so the message trickles out instead of getting blasted out.

                 As for my attempt to correct the record, I agree it does need to be blasted out. I think there are ways to do it, for instance tweeting this to Mike Cernovich letting him know he's been caught furthering fake news. His ego would force him to respond, and then we would get some attention.
                </p>
                <p>
                 My other thought was that someone could make a video, or a steemit. I think grouping Alex and Mike with the NYT would be a wake up call and possibly make this post, or one based on it, go viral, because at least one of them would perhaps respond publically, and there's our audience!
                </p>
                <p>
                 You're right, of course, we simply don't have the media presence. At the same time, I can't just sit by watch us being lied about. I tried to confront Celilia Kang the day after she wrote it, demanding she cite proper sources, but she ignored me and I gave up. It was Mike Cernovich who put me over the edge today. And he's probably more responsive than the NYT. He might even apologize and correct his mistake.

                 No, these few examples don't suffice. No one has been pushing the James' name angle for some time, it has no bearing on the present investigation. And only a few people, mainly on Twitter, pushed the idea that the bloody tranny was James. No one here pushed that, and there were efforts to correct folks on Twitter. I don't think it has gained much faction, and I don't see it as an important piece of evidence that anyone refers to.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The digging was mistakenly seen as tunnels for a few months, but we were corrected and that issue died. Again, this has no bearing on our present investigation.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The media can pick any comment any of us make, or send someone in to make a comment for them to smear us with. However this doesn't mean that it can be said we, as a group, have been running with a lot of false info. Ther are a few examples, none of them at all important, and this constitutes an extremely small percentage of the overall information we've considered. This is why the claim sounds erroneous. You've got 3 examples where we screwed up, but ther are 150 examples of wher we were right on, things that have yet to be explained away.

                   Oh that's a relief. I should probably take a look at it, but i don't trust the mods so i've not been   keen to do so.

                    I only skimmed it, but it looks pretty good in general.  My only complaints are the inclusion of known incorrect info (a very small minority of what's there, from what I saw) and a presentation style which seems to suggest that Pizzagate really is all about CPP and Alefantis.  The actual info goes much broader, but if you just glance at the presentation structure, you might think otherwise.  It should be reformatted a little bit to diffuse that.

                  Another hard-to-kill error was the belief that Kim Noble's art depicting a child being raped and its soul(?) floating upward was once put up inside CPP.  Most knew that the art had only been juxtaposed with a concert poster, but not everyone realized that detail.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Then there was the PG tweet from the fake Giuliani Twitter account.  I've personally chewed people out over that one a handful of different times, over a span of at least 2-3 months.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And people are
                  <strong>
                   still
                  </strong>
                  bringing up the fake CPP menu with the "barely survived pizzas" here, as recently as this past week.  They still think it was real.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Maybe my point wasn't clear, though.  I'm not saying there are lots of instances of wrong info becoming
                  <strong>
                   prevalent
                  </strong>
                  among us.  I'm saying there are some instances of wrong info
                  <strong>
                   persisting for a while
                  </strong>
                  among us -- usually among a minority.  That doesn't mean we're bad or generally wrong.  It means we don't have an effective "error zapper" which we can use to quickly expunge bad info.  Instead we have to shoot peas at the errors until they fade away.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I don't know if there's any easy way to change this.  If there isn't, then we might have to just live -- and, ultimately, win -- with it.

                   Thanks for this. The sticky should be a good error zapper - at least a good attempt - but i'm not sure people read it, plus it would only apply to those who visit this site.

                   I think my reaction was to the fact that Alex Jones made the errors we were supposedly embracing sound like a big deal, like something that had effectively killed our ability to properly investigate pedogate.And I guess my concern is whether this has been blown out of proportion to discredit us and everything we have discovered. It would be very interesting to see the actual percentage of the mistakes we've made, versus the times we've been right on, and made substantial discoveries.

                    We've been right more than enough times.  The errors are to be expected, and over time they generally get pushed aside by correct info.

                     Agree. IT makes me wonder why people aren't taking Alex Jones to task for making a big deal out of  these few mistakes, he literally disses our whole movement based on them, and doesn't put their rate of occurrence into perspective.

            To be fair, the mods here were actively trying to keep it all tied to CPP, as well,  for quite some time. Just sayin. Haven't quite figured out the latest mod shill MO yet, though.

             That's interesting, i hadn't noticed that at all. Could that have been in coordination with the MSM claim that we're obsessed with Comet? Their way of shaping our narrative so that MSM wasn't actually lying?

              That's probably part of it. Though I think it has more to do with the fact that if they keep the focus on comet then we won't see how far-reaching and endemic the issue is - ie damage control.

             I am asking the crowd here whether my observations of our pizzagate investigation are correct. What I have observed is a large group of serious, intelligent, caring people of all age groups and from all backgrounds, looking into any obvious (and many not at all obvious) leads that have come from the Podesta leaked emails, and from mainstream media (such as the Silsby/Clinton/33 children evidence).
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            That is correct. The media created a ludicrous claim that nobody here endorsed, falsely attributed it to us, attacked it, then claimed we've "been debunked"
           </p>
           <p>
            They debunked something they themselves invented.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nobody here said Hillary was in a basement of a pizza place torturing children.
           </p>
           <p>
            What we've said is that the restaurant ought to be carefully scrutinized and investigated given that its owner has posted pictures which seem to allude to child abuse and potentially criminal sexual themes. It is a reasonable proposition put forward by quite sane and intelligent people.
           </p>
           <p>
            The media is absolutely covering it up to the best of their ability (which is not much), and in my opinion they are thereby admitting guilt or complicity at worst, inviting more suspicion at best.

            Oh snap, I think I remember some /pol/ anon finding a connection between Kang and some group. I'm not at home, so I can't check what I have saved right now.

             What's trippy is that before this article, Kang only wrote about technology. The NYT is run by a Mexican man, and employs the same guy who whilst working for BBC covered up and lied for Jimmy Saville.

              Yep! Carlos Slim and Mark Thompson.  Btw. John Lydon "Johney Rotten" tried to out Jimmy Saville as a pedophile in a BBC interview back in the day.  They cut that part out.  We are not crazy we are DEAD RIGHT!
