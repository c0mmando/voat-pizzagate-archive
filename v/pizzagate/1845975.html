            It's using your history to serve up what it thinks you'll want. Experiment on someone else's computer with another ip and see if pizzagate shows up.

            Just thought this was interesting. Yahoo is pretty big. So we know google, FB and other tech giants are censoring this stuff, why is yahoo suggesting the pizzagate sub when merely searching for voat? Voat was here way before pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            I did a google trends for the term "voat pizzagate" and
            <a href="https://imgrpost.com/image/Yg1i">
             this came up.
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            As you can see, the search for "voat pizzagate" never existed prior to the end of Nov of 2016. Which makes sense since that's when pizzagate broke out. But what doesn't make sense is why would a popular search engine like Yahoo not be actively censoring this stuff ?
           </p>
           <p>
            Might be over thinking it but over the years my cynicism has taught me there is no such thing as coincidence. I feel like we were herded here in an echo chamber and nothing is actually getting done, in fact im starting to believe a lot of pizzagate is a psyop- doesn't make it not true though. Also, isnt voat pretty much owned by the same guys as reddit?

             How is that even possible? Voat has been around for year(s). Wouldn't the other subs have been searched more with the term voat, than pizzagate? It's the very first suggestion and given priority. Just seems weird to me something doesnt add up.

              while it's true that Voat has been around for years,
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
               v/pizzagate
              </a>
              has received a lot of public attention recently, so it kinda makes sense that the terms "voat" and "pizzagate" are often searched together - that's all this really indicates.

              Makes perfect sense.
             </p>
             <p>
              A while back voat was an empty place that everyone outside of made fun of. It was inhabited by people shadow banned from Reddit.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then after each exodus, after each screw up at Reddit, more and more people came here.
             </p>
             <p>
              Pizzagate is also starting to be taken seriously. It is the sum of 40 years of pedo scandals hitting critical mass.
             </p>
             <p>
              Recently the nambla/antifa connections have become known, and now people are taking this seriously. Today pol revealed that the deputy mayor of new orleans is connected to antifa. So now we have another soft pedo connection to leadership in new orleans, which has a very ugly history of child porn.
             </p>
             <p>
              I suspect that this is why the msm is keeping the pedo busts secret, they do not want people to freak out. But people are thirsty for this information, and they discover pizzagate, and pizzagate seems to have a good starting base here at voat.
