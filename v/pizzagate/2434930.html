<p>WTF is going on in Florida? </p>
<p>There were a few strange &quot;suicides&quot; going on down there. I don\'t know if this one is connected with the others, but it is a case of this guy being in the right place at the right time to have heard plenty ... or been involved. We can\'t rule that out yet, but I don\'t want to jump to that conclusion either without proof. He could have been a good guy that got in over his head. I found the mention of the story on Bill Chapman\'s twitter account. Most of stuff Chapman posts is not uber revealing, but (1) he does post; and (2) once in a while he does put his finger on something, so he\'s worth following. </p>

<p>Chapman\'s correct. It is MORE than weird. Usually SS is all over this kind of thing, and a trip to the home is de rigueuer, and is COMBING the place! But the police don\'t even make a visit? Or interview the guy\'s roommates? Again, it\'s a WTF moment. But it\'s in reading the story that I came upon the salient point..

<h1>Burgess worked as a clinical case manager at the University of Florida\'s Child Protection Team, a unit that responds to child abuse over a wide area of central Florida.</h1>

<p>This takes the incident from squirrelly to HUGE!!!! Here\'s more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>March 06, 2018 11:40 PM</p>
<p>GAINESVILLE, Fla.</p>
<p>Four days after he fatally shot himself outside the White House, a Florida man\'s apartment sat untouched by investigators on Tuesday. His roommates had not been questioned by police and didn\'t even know that he had died.</p>
<p>An open, empty handgun case sat on the unmade bed of Cameron Ross Burgess in the Gainesville apartment he shared with two others on a tree-lined street just a few blocks from the University of Florida campus, where he worked helping abused children. There were nine rounds still inside the gun case.</p>
<p>Justin Ford was distraught when told of his roommate\'s death by an Associated Press reporter, saying he had been texting Burgess for days about rent with no answer. He said he also hadn\'t heard of the shots fired outside the White House.</p>
<p>&quot;I must have seen him four days ago or something,&quot; Ford said, adding that it wasn\'t unusual for Burgess to leave for a few days at a time. &quot;Sometimes he would just leave and go on a camping trip or something.&quot; ...</p>
<p>Police say Burgess fired multiple shots outside the White House on Saturday before turning the gun on himself in front of dozens of onlookers. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump were in Florida at the time.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan Police in Washington D.C., the lead investigative agency, did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether the shooting was still being investigated. Gainesville Police Department spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said he did not see &quot;any records of requests for assistance from any agency regarding this incident.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again: </p>
<blockquote>
<h1>Gainesville Police Department spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said he did not see &quot;any records of requests for assistance from any agency regarding this incident.</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>There\'s confirmation that the SS or any other federal agency did not bother contacting local authorities? Just BIZARRE ... beyond BIZARRE ... it\'s circling Molochland. </p>
<p>Here\'s another article on the shooting. It gets into Cameron Ross Burgess\' graduation from Auburn and his previous job at Department of Human Resources in Auburn. I\'m also noting that he had a degree in psychology. It doesn\'t mean anything in and of itself, but everything is a clue in piecing this together as to cause and what this young man was involved in. Here\'s the link: </p>

<p>Why did Auburn grad kill himself in front of the White House?
Updated Mar 6, 6:26 PM; Posted Mar 6, 4:03 PM</p>
<p>Another friend of Burgess, Laura Meadows Terrell, wrote a tribute to him on Facebook:</p>
<p>&quot;Cam was an employee of mine when he lived in Auburn. At DHR, he was tasked with the enormous responsibility of assessing the safety of abused/neglected children and ensuring that their situations were left better than before. He was always a joy to be around. Even in what seemed like the worst of situations, he was always able to bring some light and positivity to those around him. I was remember him being very strong in his Faith. The last time I saw him, he came by my office for a visit. He brought me a Starbucks and we chatted about his future. He seemed genuinely happy and I was thankful for that. I don\'t know what happened and I\'m not in a position to judge. What I do know is that he helped a lot of children in bad situations and I was able to witness that first hand. He definitely earned a few extra jewels in his crown for that. I will hold onto my good memories of sweet Cam.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, of course, we have hints at Florida CPS being dirty, dirty, dirty. Then there\'s Florida itself being the lightning rod for several unexplained deaths. I didn\'t save all the threads posted, but I do remember Florida coming up several times and it is where the Parkland shooting took place. Oh, and by the way, did anyone happen to see this old video where a classmate calls out David Hogg for being twenty-five-years-old and from California? </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MikeTokes/status/969301114607648768">https://twitter.com/MikeTokes/status/969301114607648768</a></p>
<p>WOW: An old video has recently surfaced from one of David Hogg\'s classmates saying David &quot;shouldn\'t even be in our school, he\'s 25 from California&quot; with the annotation &quot;My debate partner is a crisis actor&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since I just came across the article on Cameron Ross Burgess, I didn\'t have time to do much digging. My first dumpster dive did yield an article about a University of Florida law professor and charged with child abuse: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.invisiblechildren.org/2017/01/30/florida-child-protection-news-for-january-2017/">http://www.invisiblechildren.org/2017/01/30/florida-child-protection-news-for-january-2017/</a></p>
<p>A Florida Law Professor at the University of Florida of Florida Levin College of Law who helps run the school’s Center for Children and Families was arrested Tuesday and charged with child abuse. Joseph Steven Jackson, 59, of Gainesville, tried to punch the child, a girl in her early teens, in the face during an argument, but the girl backed away as he swung, the arrest report says. The strike was a glancing blow, and the victim was not injured. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, I\'m glad they normalized hitting an underage female who he was having an argument with by stressing it was only a glancing glow and didn\'t injure her. Makes all the difference. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, results of a federal study examined the Florida Department of Children and Families foster care cases services released findings of foster care services. The agency found between April to September 2016 more than half of the children removed in 80 cases were placed in foster homes were without services and without following all safety plans. Florida in 2005, contracted out services to 17 different private service providers. The agency has 90 days to correct the deficiencies. The agency has already called all service providers around the table to find ways to rectify the issues in the federal review.</p>
<p>Next, the Florida Department Children and Families (DCF) also receives calls of human trafficking of children. A 54% increase from the previous year showed a total of 1,892 reports. The increase per DCF was due to increased training and screening tools developed between DCF, the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice and the Attorney General. DCF tracks human trafficking by three primary categories: sexual exploitation by a non-caregiver, such as an adult entertainment club or escort service; sexual exploitation by a parent, guardian, or caregiver; and labor trafficking per the Associated Press.</p>
<p>The Florida Department of Children and Families state website reports all child fatalities within the state. Causes of deaths are still under investigation. What was not found in the news throughout the state indicated 23 children have died due to abuse and neglect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here\'s another article that highlights the burgeoning business of human trafficking in Florida: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/human-trafficking-cases-increase-more-than-50-percent-in-florida/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/human-trafficking-cases-increase-more-than-50-percent-in-florida/</a></p>
<h1>Human trafficking cases increase more than 50 percent in Florida</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>And Burgess has been identified as being from Alabama: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.whio.com/news/national-govt--politics/police-alabama-man-who-killed-himself-near-white-house/xS6jWsxCyWNNYVjOn340NL/">http://www.whio.com/news/national-govt--politics/police-alabama-man-who-killed-himself-near-white-house/xS6jWsxCyWNNYVjOn340NL/</a></p>
<p>Police say it was 26-year-old Cameron Ross Burgess, recently of Maylene, Alabama</p>

Joseph Steven Jackson, 59, of Gainesville, tried to punch the child, a girl in her early teens, in the face during an argument, but the girl backed away as he swung, the arrest report says. The strike was a glancing blow, and the victim was not injured.

           Yes, I'm glad they normalized hitting an underage female who he was having an argument with by stressing it was only a glancing glow and didn't injure her. Makes all the difference.

            Also, results of a federal study examined the Florida Department of Children and Families foster care cases services released findings of foster care services. The agency found between April to September 2016 more than half of the children removed in 80 cases were placed in foster homes were without services and without following all safety plans. Florida in 2005, contracted out services to 17 different private service providers. The agency has 90 days to correct the deficiencies. The agency has already called all service providers around the table to find ways to rectify the issues in the federal review.

            Next, the Florida Department Children and Families (DCF) also receives calls of human trafficking of children. A 54% increase from the previous year showed a total of 1,892 reports. The increase per DCF was due to increased training and screening tools developed between DCF, the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice and the Attorney General. DCF tracks human trafficking by three primary categories: sexual exploitation by a non-caregiver, such as an adult entertainment club or escort service; sexual exploitation by a parent, guardian, or caregiver; and labor trafficking per the Associated Press.

           <p>
            The Florida Department of Children and Families state website reports all child fatalities within the state. Causes of deaths are still under investigation. What was not found in the news throughout the state indicated 23 children have died due to abuse and neglect.

            More info on Parkland shooting:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Of the 17 confirmed deaths, the rabbis believe that at least six were Jewish, including an adult security guard. Several of those killed were participants at the Chabad centers in Parkland or nearby Coral Springs. Biston says that Chabad rabbis have been working closely with Broward County SHERIFF SCOTT ISRAEL (emphasis mine), who is a congregant at Chabad, to ensure that the bodies of the Jewish dead are released for burial as soon as possible in accordance with Jewish tradition.
           </p>
           <p>
            Chabad has also enlisted the help of several therapists who have volunteered to counsel students. Observant Jews, they are uniquely positioned to provide both clinical and religious support."
           </p>
           <p>
            "This morning, several teens who had survived the massacre came to Chabad to recite the Hagomel blessing of thanksgiving at the Torah. One of them had filmed the shooting."

                Don't forget, Sheriff Israel was a member of that Chabad. Most likely it fell into his hands.....
I also thought it was interesting to use the word "filmed". Sounds like he was prepared ahead of time. They didn't mention it was recorded with a cell phone. The Chabad "therapists" could also get info as to what the students saw, and pass it on to Israel.

             "Two Florida SWAT Officers Suspended for Heading to Parkland Massacre
The Miramar officers did not have permission to respond to the shooting in Parkland on Feb. 14, when 17 people were killed."
            </p>
            <p>
             "The SWAT officers who responded were Detective Jeffrey Gilbert and Detective Carl Schlosser. One of them told supervisors he was in the Coral Springs area when the gunfire happened; it’s not known where the other drove from, police spokeswoman Tania Rues said.
            </p>
            <p>
             “They were both close by (the high school),” Rues said.
            </p>
            <p>
             A third SWAT member, Officer Kevin Gonzalez, was accused of being linked to several social media posts that put the city and police in a negative light, and was suspended for violating the department’s social media policy and the code of conduct, Rues said."
            </p>
            <p>
             "The afternoon of the shooting, Miramar police placed the SWAT team on stand-by in case a request came from the Broward Sheriff’s Office to assist. That call for the team trained in military tactics never came, Rues said.
            </p>

             The Broward Sheriff’s Office said Wednesday it could not confirm whether anyone spoke with Miramar that day, but said Miramar’s SWAT team was “not needed” during the incident."

             COMMENT:
This article was recently posted on March 8. A little late. Was this to explain sightings of multiple shooters and shooter described as wearing swat type gear?
            </p>
            <p>
             "“Then I suddenly saw the shooter, about 20 feet from me, standing at the end of the hallway, actively shooting down the hallway – just a barrage of bullets. And I’m staring at him thinking, ‘Why is the police here? This is strange.’ He was in full metal garb – helmet, face mask, bulletproof armor, shooting this rifle that I’d never seen before.”"
            </p>
            <p>
             "Strangely, there have been few if any reports that Nikolas Cruz was decked out in full body armor, or that he resembled a member of law enforcement."

            I thought this whole thing was sketchy too and started looking into this after it happened. In one of the articles I read it said they found a cigar box with pictures and documents inside Burgess's car. I remember getting frustrated by them not saying what the pictures and documents were. Will try to find the article.

            I just remember reading about this and the sentence tagged on the end of the article said something like this: 'This kind of incident outside the White House is not uncommon'.  I remember thinking, they should have written 'nothing to see here....move along!' - SAME THING. lol

            Something odd about the picture of Burgess' room. 1) hard liquor bottles when you work for CPS and you've attended Baptist functions? and 2) leaving Florida to go to Wash DC without the gun case? if he got pulled over with a unsecured gun he'd have been arrested and apparently he wasn't a new gun owner.
           </p>

            Florida is so corrupt. Read about Rep. Alcee Hastings, Senior Democratic Whip representing Broward/Palm Beach Counties. He's a former Federal impeached judge (for taking kickbacks) who got elected after the scandal. Currently in the news for having the government pay out 200K for sexual harassment charges made from a former employee. Currently paying out approx. 480k/year for 3 senior staffers in his offices, one of whom is long term girlfriend.

            An open, empty handgun case sat on the unmade bed of Cameron Ross Burgess in the Gainesville apartment he shared with two others on a tree-lined street just a few blocks from the University of Florida campus, where he worked helping abused children. There were nine rounds still inside the gun case.  Whoa.  Empty Handgun Case on the Bed?  I thought his roommate was worried.  He was texting him for days and when he never answered he didn't go into his room?  Strange.  If he did, he would have seen the Empty Handgun Case.  How long had they been roommates?  Seems they would have known each other well enough to walk into a bedroom.

            What are they trying to say? Anybody can just fire 'multiple shots' outside the WH, and they won't look into that, as long as the guy kills himself in the end? WTF?

            As mentioned in my prior post this morning, the Clinton Foundation and the Cliinton Global Initiative (CGI) are responsible for human trafficking being the #1 global crime committed.  These organizations must be dissolved, and Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea must be arrested.  It's a no-brainer, yet nothing is done.

             Definitely not the same face. Cameron Ross Burgess is from AL, but does he have relatives in FL? Don't know.

             They're all from the same link that was included in the tweet. I just chose to break up the quotes to highlight what was being said. So it's this one:

            FL has a very long history of horrific child abuses documented at least 100 years.  He was probably abused.  Got into the CPS business and helped perpetuated the crimes.  The noose may have been tightening.  Or someone threatened to go public.  Sprinkle in some MK, SSRI, and drugs/alcohol (one article said there were empty bottles of liquor everywhere) and BINGO - It's Trump's fault.

            He was manipulated somehow, to go off himself in front of the WH to send a "message".  Whatever that message is I don't know.  In fact I ENCOURAGE ALL PEDOS TO GO TO THE WH AND EAT A BULLET.  That will show POTUS!

              FL has a very long history of horrific child abuses documented at least 100 years. He was probably abused. Got into the CPS business and helped perpetuated the crimes. The noose may have been tightening.

             It could be. I just don't want to throw this guy to the wolves yet. If he was abused, he could have been trying to help. It would help to know what his cases involved or if he reported anyone. Also how did this become political? Was he alt-left? Did he tweet anything to our POTUS?

              I thought that at the time of the report.  Maybe he was being threatened and knew he was going to be killed anyway, so he thought shooting himself publicly outside the White House will definitely have to be looked!' -  But after the nothing-burger report/response in the paper and on the news, this proves there is more to it?  This was what I saw as a throwaway comment at the end of the article about him.  **This kind of incident outside the White House is not uncommon'. I remember thinking, they should have written 'nothing to see here....move along!' - SAME THING. **

               It really is fake news now. Somebody shooting a gun on the White House grounds is always a big deal.

               Now if I look at this from a different angle, the only reason this wouldn't get a thorough vetting is because the authorities ... meaning those controlled by the Cannibal Elite ... already knew who he was and why he did this. All that was left was to clean out his room and get whatever incriminating evidence was there. Don't want the police that aren't in on this cabal to stick their noses into something that would be difficult to explain.

             Well, you gotta understand that the news is concentrating on some pretty important stuff like how many scoops of ice cream and diet sodas our POTUS consumes per day. Then there's flying to Thailand to interview skanks. They don't have time to actually cover news stories.

               It'd be a shame if that guy left evidence for our POTUS to find. Maybe it was his way of making good. And really, wouldn't anyone figure they'd send a cop or two to your residence so they would find what you left? Wonder if it was o his laptop .... or maybe a video .... reports ... something's there.

                Another missing laptop?  Hmm.  I am sure that if they searched that apt. that the others got the impression they better keep their mouths shut. You know they had to be there, only if to take everything out and keep it from being released.  I wonder if his friend in the apt. looked through his stuff and laptop.

                  I don't know but don't they all have one?  If he worked for CPS I am sure he must have had one.  Very strange.  I think that is the first thing police or fbi would check for.

                   Not necessarily. Gloria's child welfare system is crap and not well managed. I worked in an agency that was well managed however they still couldn't afford to have laptops for everyone

                    Wow that is ridiculous.  All the money that is thrown at those agencies, no laptop.  I still think he had to have one of his own.  Possibly entered what he knew in there.   He would have used encryption if he had any kind of brain.

                     I'm sure he had one of his own at the very least. But for no law enforcement to even check out his house seems incredibly sloppy at the very least

                       Our kids might since this stuff gets "declassified" so long after it happens when they think no one is around to care about it anymore. They are known manipulators and liars!

                        God I hope the younger ones hook on to this stuff and are red pilled.  All we can hope for.  They really don't question things like others did.  They are being slowly brainwashed and it is killing me.

                         Well I teach my kids about what goes on in this world,to question everything, and to think for themselves. I was so upset when I learned how everything I had known or been taught was basically a lie and although it isn't sunshine and rainbows, I am teaching my kids the truth so they can be prepared for the ugly way this world is heading. All parents have a duty to protect, and educate their kids so that when we are gone, the work we have done isn't undone by more and more lies

                           I know, it scares me because they are raising the people who my kids will be living amongst in the future! It's only gonna get worse with the dumbed down mindset of wanting to be told what to do and how to think. It's hard to know what to help prepare my kids for because I don't think I can even imagine how bad it's gonna suck!

                            I know.  I know people that don't even watch their local news.  They look at the same sites on their phones but don't know what is going on in their own town. I had to tell the next door neighbor about some attempts at grabbing children in our area.  The two kids kicked the guy and ran, so they are safe.  He did not know.  I said watch the news.  Oh, yeah he said. He is now more aware.  All we can do is warn them.

                    Possibly. But who knows how long he was out of it.  They surely are perfecting this MK stuff.  They have been doing this for ages.  I think the quiet after he shot himself, they were quickly getting rid of info, the plan was to release stuff in a few days.  They scrubbed but remember they have been making mistakes.  There could still be something out there. They are not as smart as they think.  Look at all the stuff about Hogg and Kasky that's still out there and Israel the Sheriff.  Sloppy.
