            I have a recollection of a Dr who was a friend of a friend saying he had to do community service for a drug conviction and did it (was assigned?) with Drs. without Borders.  He seemed to not like doing it.  If my memory is correct I wonder how common this is.  If this is common such Drs. could be convinced to be quiet about anything nefarious going on because of the terms of their sentencing.  I can't find anything on the web about this and the memory is a bit vague.  But perhaps others can find out if some of the "volunteers" are doing it to avoid jail time.

            Just another random thing I found that has nothing to do with this thread that was interesting nonetheless. 
It is a  Book preview that talks about the RH factor in blood in the small excerpt that I scanned.  It said the book was fiction, but the world is upside down these days. 
It might be interesting for someone interested in that subject.

             I've seen those but thanks for trying to help. There was a photo of a page in de Mohrenschildt's notebook on the Internet with about eight names including Orlando Bosch (JFK assassination accomplice), David Atlee Phillips, and the serpent-tongued toad named William F. Buckley. Now I can't find it anymore but I think it may be preserved in a book somewhere.
