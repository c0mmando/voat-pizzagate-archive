            Is it normal in the US for regular police to be involved in the apprehension of a suspect involving an armed siege/stand-off? I would have thought that would have been a job for a SWAT team? Yes/no?

            they seem obsessed with appearing like upstanding citizens. or being religiously pious. i kind of like a certain amount of religious passion, but he does it, and a lot of his friends, in a real superficially overbearing way. i have noticed this is a pattern. clinton involved in children welfare, she always says. cliff richard, and other celebrities, who act over friendly, like of course you can trust them. Biden has the same vibe.  like they are overcompensating... fooling themselves, or trying to fool others...

            precicesly. must be the writers of the script those "reporters" followed, wanted it left out. they would be recruiting actors wherever they could, I would imagine. I think it could be revealing to see, if Maddison's case is listed normally, or of it will be like so many other trials when it comes to staged events, and no one is allowed to  see what is happening. some listening devices, in the right place around this time, would probably be most revealing. I can imagine people are talking a lot about this, behind closed doors. i am going to have to look into what is availiable. they won't expect it. there should be one in every shop that is under suspicion. if a real investigation were happening, there would be. maybe it is up to citizens?

            that is a conspicuous absence. they might try to work it into the story soon, you never know. it would normally be the first thing they would say. or one of the main points anyway. that story never really ended. said a 13 year old went to hospital, and he was culpable, that was it. Did they live, i wonder? Did his father intervene, but Maddison owed a return service?  i found his facebook was remarkably absent for many months recently, like he was somewhere doing something.... his facebook appears not to be there now. harry l welch is still there. i gleaned one thing from harry's page, that he lost a son, called harry III. he mentions it, and a friend commiserates with him. He had adopted children as well. and Maddison's brother seems like a worry. i think harry is a worry. he worked in Haiti. i wonder if he knew any of Silsby's crowd, or Jorge her lawyer's? that will be my next lead

            They still can't say for sure how many shots were supposed to be fired. First it was none, which was most likely since no one heard anything. Then it was one, two, three, and finally, until the police arrived he kept firing.... now it's at least one shot.
