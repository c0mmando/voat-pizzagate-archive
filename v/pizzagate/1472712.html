            You cannot convince people that you are a source of the truth by lying to or misleading them.  All people aren't tired of fact checking, they simply do not know what that means when no one actually does it.  I still care about the truth as do others; ignoring the truth would set a dangerous precedent.

            We have proof of malpractice by the MSM, it may not be beneficial to stoop to their level.  Let them act like idiots, we don't need to.  For example focusing on the details from Monica Petersen's family/friends doubting suicide and getting this out to at least one neutral media source will give evidence to our cause and allow us to further discredit WaPo among others, and we can do this without the use of logical fallacies.   If your enemies strategy is not working why would you want to use it?  We need to lead by example and show what journalists should be doing but are not.
