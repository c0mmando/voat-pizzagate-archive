            <em>
             The slightest sighting of female sexuality whips him into a frenzy of misogynist zeal. […] Mr. Brock’s misogyny injects a poison more lethal than political partisanship into the national discourse. In my own interactions with Brock, he displayed a troubling attitude toward women.

            "May 7, 2004 – CAMP Profile | CAMP Rehoboth
           </p>
           <p>
            William Grey, previous partner of David Brock, who lived with Brock in the lily white expensive neighborhoods of Georgetown and Rehoboth Beach/Henlopen Acres, before Brock partnered up with James Alefantis and bought a new house in the lily white and expensive Kalorama/Embassy Row neighborhood (where people of color are almost all either the help or Ambassadors), sure has a small internet footprint.  (I’ve been to a gay Democratic fundraiser at the Rehoboth beach manse shortly before Grey’s civil suit forced Brock to sell it.)
Other than his civil suit against David Brock for the return of antiques and art, he seems to have worked in pet rescue and adoption in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware and has now disappeared, with a settlement payment of $850,000 in exchange for silence about Media Matters’ alleged financial misconduct. Indeed the only other thing I can find about him is a breif note about feral cat rescue in the Rehoboth gay community magazine, Camp Rehoboth. Since Brock’s interns and staffers often look like younger versions of James Alefantis, his new partner until their recent break up, I was curious to see what he looked like. So far, no joy."

            Is anyone else having problem with links from the above article? 
It's the link to the lawsuit filed by Grey, why scrubbed?

            Can't access the counterclaim by Brock either... :-(
