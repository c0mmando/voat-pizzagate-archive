<p>Perhaps another pre-emptive, damage control pas de deux. Or she might be reveling in her utter and complete impunity, rubbing everyone’s nose in it. At this point, she must be really convinced that although Moloch didn’t hand her down the presidency, she’s still under his protection. Or she might be only testing the degree of public (un)awareness and assessing the likelihood of getting caught. Less likely, but still a probability, there is that unconscious, moral impulse to confess and receive punishment. <br />

            Tucker Carlson ripped her a new one last night about this video. He was laughing at her. It was great. When she came out with that song playing, I couldn't stop laughing.

           <p>
            She's going to say the Russians got information from Seth Rich and they killed him. She's saying who told them? Who were they colluding with? Their story always changes according to what the truthers turn up. Or, what she calls "fake news" sites.
           </p>
           <p>
            She's even blaming the Washington Post and the New York Times (who work for them and lie for them). She says they kept it going in the news. It's everyone's fault. She cannot stop spreading FAKE NEWS about the Russians. They have said over and over there is no proof of that. Why aren't people upset about the fake news she spreads?

             1) We don't need to. All we need to investigate her is a probable cause. We sure have that. 
2) What is your proof that this is a "propaganda" site? Please give instances of "propaganda" info as reported on Sputnik vs. same info objectively and truthfully reported on "non-propaganda" sites.

               1) Podesta's emails, Alefantis' twitter account, Haiti child trafficking, the Clinton Foundation, a 33-names strong death-list associated with the Clintons, the latest being Seth Rich... I can go on and on. And of course, a coverup of all of the above. At the moment we don't need a warrant. No journalist needs a warrant to investigate. But if we need a warrant, we'll get one. Tell your bosses that we are the FBI now. 
2) I didn't ask you who owns RT &amp; Sputnik. I asked you for specific instances of "propaganda". I can wait.

                Unfortunately for your probable cause case all of that is bullshit.  And it shows you don't know what probable cause means.
               </p>
               <p>
                Podesta's emails.    They look real sinister when you change what the words mean.
               </p>
               <p>
                Alefantis' Twitter account......................real solid bit of evidence you got there
               </p>
               <p>
                Haiti child trafficking.      In general?  Any specifics and don't say Silsby because that just shows you don't know what you are talking about
               </p>
               <p>
                Clinton Foundation.            The guy who wrote the book that started all the rumors admitted several times he had no evidence of wrongdoing.
               </p>
               <p>
                33 name strong death list.           Paranoiacs have been striking out with this one for close to 30 years now.
               </p>
               <p>
                Look if you're going to play pretend and make shit up just say so.   Just don't use grownup terms like probable cause.

                  Probable cause is not needed for an investigation, it's needed for an arrest or search warrant or an arrest warrant.  And you need explain the specific crime committed.  And you absolutely lack a specific crime.  You have a bunch of suspicion, you're miles and miles away from probable cause.

            Why doesn't Hillary just fuck off already?  Here she's just using technical words to baffle those less intelligent in her audience - it's obvious she really doesn't know what she's talking about...
           </p>
           <p>
            ...and anyway, what she described sounds like the workings of any normal political election campaign - like the DNC's for instance.
           </p>
           <p>
            Talking about the Podesta emails and Wikileaks being linked with Russia without any fucking evidence at all.
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem is confirmation bias in her supporters and anti-Trump types will allow them to believe this cunt of a woman and help spread the narrative that these fuckers are peddling further.

            When someone guilty is confronted with their crimes this is a tactic they use to ease their discomfort. Be the one who brings it up. Mock it. Joke about it. Savile did it by joking he couldn't stand kids, despite working with them for a lot of his career. The McCanns talk through a scenario of killing Maddie as if this proves how unbelievable the accusations are.

            She is unhinged and unwell. I don't doubt that someone is kicking themselves for allowing her to run for President. Too late now.

            Every time she thinks she's made a profound point and looks up, nods and smirks my blood boils. What a boring woman - devoid of grace, humour, humility, empathy and any attractive humain trait. No wonder she lost.

            Trust comments like that will make some people curious enough to look into Pizzagate/Pedogate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think there's a high interest in stopping sexual aggression of any kind in our society . . .
           </p>
           <p>
            Star-Ledger in NJ has been running a series on sexual assaults student-by-student in our Elementary schools and High Schools
and they're looking for programs such as were put in place in Colleges to protect students.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bad news is that this is happening across the US - good news is that they're paying attention to it.
Besides ways to protect students moving from classroom to classroom, some students are also 
uniting to not be "bystanders" and to take a stand if they see something like this going down.
Also they offer protection to anyone who has been
            <strong>
             "groped."
            </strong>
            They are also working with parents and psychologists to finds answers to this and how to stop it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is it coincidence that this is going on across the nation and that we have a president in the 
White House who bragged about "groping" beautiful women?
           </p>

            Plus Comcast and Verzion pushing pornography on cable TV.

            'I was .... you know running a child trafficking ring from the basement of a pizzeria.' 
A rather cunning way to deflect the real culprit - skippy. She was covering for them then, and she is covering for them now. Coud Killary read some of the emails for the audience? That mystery pizza related hanky for a start. She could mention Robie Mook and his ties to Jacob Schwartz ???? No fake news??? So 6mth babies being raped is actually real? In that case could Pizzagate be real? Well let's see Schwartz - Mook - CPP - American Psycho connection. How about it Killary, and you can throw in Sean Hannity being a conspiracy theorist for exposing Seth Rich murder. Killary - you should have stayed in the woods where you belong keeping Skippy company.

            I knew this old twat would start going around making references to this eventually. Of course they'll try to take ownership and control the narrative. And the narrative they're pushing is that "pizzagate" is a simple urban myth about Comet Pizza, and that's all.
            <br/>
            This is the best part:

             They can only control it so much, though. Their narrative will never be able to account for certain things like Jeffrey Epstein, Laura Silsby, Biljana Djurdjevic, Seth Rich, etc. We're gonna win, because they can't control the truth.

              Biljana Djurdjevic's art is about coming of age during a time of genocide.  Her point of view is the same as children in her paintings.  If you miss that, you miss everything about her art.

               <p>
                Given that Djurdjevic's art is all about sympathizing with the children in her paintings, Podesta's interest in her work doesn't reflect badly on him, even if you try to flatten her work in the most reductive way possible.

                 Are you fucking serious? You're comparing an average person liking The Godfather...to an elite lobbyist who's part of a political posse intimately connected with Jeffrey Epstein liking art that features kids being raped, tortured, and murdered?

                  Did you see what happened at the tollbooth in The Godfather? Or did you miss that part? That's far more graphic than anything I've ever seen in Djurdjevic's work.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Have you actually looked at any of Djurdjevic's paintings or did you just believe pizzagate lies about them? Your description of Djurdjevic's art is false,  of course, as is the "intimately connected with Jeffrey Epstein" bit.

                   You're saying Djurdjevic's art DOESN'T depict raped, tortured, and murdered children? They obviously do, anyone can see that. You're disputing that the Podestas aren't part of the Clinton inner circle and that the Clintons AREN'T intimately connected with Epstein? What the fuck are you doing here? Shilling?

                    Show me just one Djurdjevic painting depicting that. Not "I think this is what could happen" but "this is what is  actually  shown happening in the painting".  Remember that this is someone who  grew up in Serbia during the 1990s Balkan war and wants you to viscerally understand how it felt to be a child in that context.

                    And yes, believe it or not, you can be friends with someone without being "intimately connected with" everyone they know. Only conspiracy theorists think that every friend-of-a-friend situation is an intimate relationship.

                     Anyone can google Djurdjevic and see SEVERAL paintings of hers which show children with bodies red from abuse, tied up in tiled rooms, and/or lying down with dead eyes. You're clearly a fucking shill. Done responding to you.

                      So in other words you can't point to any paintings depicting murder, rape, or torture, as I said. Glad you acknowledge that I was right.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Can think of why anyone who experienced being trapped and vulnerable and horrified as a child by war, and wants the viewer to understand the horrors of war, might depict being trapped and vulnerable and horrified as a child? So the viewer will feel unsettled and horrified at the thought of putting other children on that situation?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Of course you can. You know exactly why she painted what she did, and you know perfectly well that  she was not celebrating  the thought of a child being in the kind of situation she was in, and you know perfectly well that people can be profoundly moved by a work of art without finding it pleasant, and the only reason you are pretending otherwise is that you are a liar.

                That's like, her entire backstory as an artist. Trying to analyze Djurdjevic without knowing that is like trying to analyze Scorsese films when you've never heard of New York City before.

                  Google will let you search within a particular time frame.   Search for her name before 2016.

                  I know that about her because the point of view of the paintings was obvious to me and I took a few minutes to read about her.

            Though one can't be sure exactly who her 'handlers' are at this point, nor what exactly is going on behind the scenes, I believe at this point she's just being trotted out to do clean-up work and spin. Surely her days are numbered.

            Watch the clip at just around the three minute mark ... she gets into the Podesta emails that the "Russians hacked." She says the Podesta emails were "mundane." Or "run of the mill" I think.
