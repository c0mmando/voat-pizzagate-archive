<p>Jeffrey Epstein becomes an Israeli campaign issue.</p>
<p>A day after Epstein was arrested in New York on underage sex-trafficking charges, he became a player in the Israeli election campaign and a monkey on Barak’s back.</p>
<p>Netanyahu got the ball rolling with social media posts raising questions about Epstein’s relationship with Barak. Then the Israeli and global media took over.</p>
<p>Epstein financed much of an investment of several million dollars formally made by Barak in the high-tech company Reporty Homeland Security, now called Carbyne, Haaretz reported. Barak entered the business relationship though other former partners kept their distance after Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting a teenage girl to prostitution and served 13 months in prison.</p>
<p>Barak defended his decision on the Israeli news program “Meet the Press.”</p>
<p>“He’d served his sentence for soliciting prostitution — the indictment didn’t say she was a minor,” the former prime minister said.</p>
<p>Barak announced last week that his attorneys are working to dissolve the limited partnership company he formed with Epstein.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the British tabloid the Daily Mail on July 16 republished on its front page photos it first ran in January 2016 showing Barak with his face covered entering Epstein’s Manhattan home. When the photo ran originally, Barak was identified as “an unidentified man … with his own security detail at Jeffrey Epstein’s New York Mansion.” Last week the photo ran alongside a second photo showing Barak leaving the apartment with his face uncovered and wearing a pillbox-shaped hat.</p>
<p>Barak, who married Nili Priel in 2007 after he divorced his first wife, Nava Cohen, in 2003, told the Daily Beast in an interview published July 15 that he was introduced to Epstein by the late Israeli President Shimon Peres and has met him about 10 times, including at two of Epstein’s Manhattan residences and on the financier’s private Caribbean island. But, he told the news website, “I’ve never been there at a party” and he never met any women or girls there.</p>
<p>He acknowledges being the man in the Daily Mail photo, saying he covered his face because of the extremely cold New York weather.</p>
<p>Barak has threatened to sue the Daily Mail for running the photos and insinuating that he paid a covert visit to Epstein, calling it a “blood libel.” The newspaper ignored a Barak ultimatum that it remove the article and the photos or face a lawsuit.</p>

            This video is quite interesting (just ignore the pro-Israel and the pro-Mueller bias).

            The two journalists talk about Epstein, Ehud Barack, George Nader's Israel ties, and the similarity between a new 911 phone app for the US market which seems to have been designed by a Mossad front company, and an app Erik Prince (ex-Blackwater) has created  for the Chinese government to collect personal data.
           </p>
           <p>
            George Nader and Erik Prince (who employed Nader although he knew he was a convicted pedo) have been on my personal shit list for a long time, and I found it interesting that the video alleges that Nader might be, in fact, an asset of the Israelis as well.
           </p>
           <h1 id="md-section">
           </h1>
           <p>
            The video alleges that Epstein might have been interested in science in order to collect info about the latest scientific developments for Mossad.
