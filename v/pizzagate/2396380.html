            This is my only experience with this story.  Back when this story first broke I commented on the Sydney subreddit (in reply to a comment which was like "What is wrong with some people?") saying that paedophilia rings are almost connected with organised satanism.  Interestingly minutes later my short comment had been downvoted to infinity.  If it had to be covered up so urgently, I'm guessing I hit the nail on the head.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've lived in Sydney for a long time.  What usually happens when organised paedophilia is briefly exposed here is either (a) a patsy takes one for the team, ie "it was just a lone wolf goy"--and who would ever know if that patsy even serves their sentence in jail, or (b) the evidence is lost/contaminated/deemed insufficient and the case fizzles out.  (The greatest example of this is when a couple were accused of making child pornography in their daycare centre.  The parents of the young victims alleged that the husband dressed up as a clown the children called "Mr Bubbles", and the children were invited to get in a bubble bath with him.  The child witnesses were (supposedly accidentally) "led" in the recorded police interviews, thus contaminating the evidence.  Case never went to trial.
           </p>
           <p>
            Good chance this Katoomba circus school one will end up being branded as "satanic panic", kids were unreliable witnesses etc, the accused were innocent victims of a witchhunt poor things! blah blah blah.  If anyone gets jailed, the verdict will be successfully appealed, say five years later, and then the poor innocent, unfairly jailed accused gets like five million in compensation.  These people control the media, the courts and the police, and eventually they win.

             Gettin REAL sick of seeing this BS repeated over and over again. McMartins and the couple that just had their convictions overturned. Now these monsters are "innocent" and free to start rapin' and murderin' again and we're down-voted nutbags for talkin about it. If it werent for holy spirit answering my prayers, I would be a vigilante. God calms me down and keeps me workin at feeding and protecting my family instead.
            </p>
            <p>
             Otherwise I would be prowlin the streets with a spiked bat lookin for satanists and pedos to throw in my tree shredder.

             It truly stinks that there is kind of a "playbook" for how people get out of these things. What I think also happens, is that they try not to let the case get any traction so that there is really no legal precedent to pin a legal response to. Let's not forget, even though they also own many of the tentacles that would put them away, they also do rituals to avoid jail/invisibility workings. Thanks for the response

               Agreed. There's a guy in South Australia that is a pedo hunter that is now needing to accept kickstarter-like funding to pay his court fees for doing something CLEARLY the police SHOULD have been doing. Pathetic.

            Ugh.  I just looked at the DM.  Sick.  Nothing like starting a Family Circus Porn Business.  What a thing to teach your children.  This is Beyond Comprehension.  They should all be locked up forever.  Throw Away The Key.

            The profile said she is a carer and teacher who works for the Joan Sutherland Performing Arts Centre and was given a scholarship to train and attend the first National Indigenous and Social Circus Training and Conference.   JiOAN Sutherland Performing Arts Centre.  Is this a chain or private?  I hope it is not a chain circus school.  Lord.  They are Horrid People.  No Bail. As it should be.
