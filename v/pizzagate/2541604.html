            I recall that already 20 years ago, when snuff films were regarded by most people as merely being 'an urban legend', there were reports of gay sex shops in Amsterdam that sold snuff films (and produced them), and British pedos travelling there to purchase them. Like the guy who now lives in Prague and organizes 'tourist trips' for pedos aka rape tours.
           </p>
           <p>
            And the Royal Family seems to have been connected - the deceased brother of the current King, Friso, married a woman who had a relationship with a crimimal who was rumoured to be involved in human trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            Queen Beatrix, mother of the current King, famously wore a pizza brooch when she met Marina Abramovic. Go figure...

             I remember reading about them and their pizzagatisms. If I read it here, it was awhile ago... like more than a year. 
They are a monarchy little known to Americans.

            GD144, perhaps you should find a way to repost your research, I think  it  is so important.  Liberals  have always regarded  Amsterdam  as a progressive , moral and ethical playground for the sexually  adventurous  adult.  But what lurks beneath the surface is shocking.  The elites act as if they are entitled to brutal  and sordid  sexual pleasures since they are so otherwise  highly civilized. Sometimes I gloss over links due to time or interests but I read all of yours  to fully appreciate how entrenched  pedophelia  is, murders and all. How can that small country ever be cleansed of this scourge.

             Some posts are the product of lots of investigation: forming deeply hidden connection or connecting obscure ot esoteric points of fact. Some posts share the benefit of highly specialized knowledge, like medical, legal or witchcraft knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
             My posts are usually just reader’s digests. I frequently read tons, and fairly quickly. The result is the links I attach.
            </p>
            <p>
             So what would you like me to do? If you click my name, you should see my posts on my profile... also... one of the first comments on THIS post pasted all of the links from my previous ‘Joris Demmink’ post. (Sophrosyme) Does that help?
            </p>
            <p>
             When I think about the Netherlands, I see parallels in Portugal. many US states have legal drugs now. I used to want that. But years ago, I stopped. I’ve been living clean for awhile. I worry that these places are sleeping, sliding towards disaster. The recent law in California, about banning the sale of materials or services that help people who want to control/adjust their sexual orientation, that’s an example of a sleeping populace being hoodwinked, IMO.

             For sure, it seems the combo of legal drugs and legal prostitution is deadly. There are some Asian nations that are basically the same, depraved hubs of pedobusiness. Nevada has legal prostitution... I guess watch out for drugs there.

              i only meant to suggest a repost that might capture a wider audience tho lack of comments does not always equate with lack of interest. i just felt that folks were making the. mistske of overlooking your excellent reseach. However you can lead a horse to water but you cant make it drink. The 1000 page manual is so disgusting,  perhaps its better that few people know about  it. thanks for your efforts..

            this post together with the comments is disturbing and enlightening at the same time: it deserves alot more attention than what it  is presently receiving.  It appears that the Dutch have pedophelia down to a science. The pedophelia manual could serve as a measuring stick for analyzing and validating the raw evidence concerning an individual suspected of  being a pedophile as well as identifying the tricks of the trade when a ring is suspected or when commercial trafficking  is occuring. I wonder how much of our observations about Alefantis and  Washington DC measures up. Thank you GD144.

             That’s actually brilliant. At the very least, it could be a useful indicator. Hmmm.... historically, this culture has been able to constantly hide in plain sight by adjusting their visible norms. I’m gonna put my thinking cap on. Maybe we can make an underground meme checklist to pass around to pizzagate investigators.
