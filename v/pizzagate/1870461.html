<p>Also if you are researching pizzagate I suggest this interview with Tim Tate who was a producer of Conspiracy of Siilence, the Discovery channels never aired Franklin documentary. Tim Tate discusses Franklin but he also discusses other cases, satanic ritual abuse, and cover ups. He\'s smart. And well researched on all of these topics. I was very surprised to have never heard of Tim Tate until yesterday. Please take a listen -

            I kept my eye on internet traffic via various search engines after your posts and my subsequent post last weekend:
            <a href="https://archive.is/haJmf">
             Is Larry King of Franklin Scandal Now Singing for KIDS Opera?
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I observed some very "interesting" reactions, including Tweets and posts on other sites with links to both of our threads, even Opera Nova's Facebook page.  Someone also  posted the clip of his recent impromptu performance at Bus Boys and Poets to You Tube.  Then within 2-3 days a complete disappearance occurred--not merely Larry King's name and bio being removed from Opera Nova's home page.  These disappearances were especially obvious when I used Google search -- not so much so with Duck Duck Go.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regardless, I agree with the posters on THIS thread who expressed caution in 'celebrating' LK's removal from Opera Nova's main page.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             In my view, the removal could mean several things:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             A.)
            </strong>
            The person in question is indeed Larry King of Franklin Scandal and Opera Nova was  NOT aware of his background, so they quickly responded to our efforts and removed him entirely for the safety of the children and the integrity of their organization.   OR
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             B.)
            </strong>
            The person in question is indeed Larry King of Franklin Scandal and Opera Nova WAS aware of his background, and merely removed his name from their website homepage once our posts drew public attention.   OR
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             C.)
            </strong>
            The person in question is NOT Larry King of Franklin Scandal and they removed his name to protect him from slander.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are probably more scenarios to consider, but for now,
            <strong>
             my guess would be B is the correct answer.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            If so, that would mean there are very dark and powerful forces at play, and we exposed ourselves in exposing them.  Alas, such is the risk one takes in fighting evil.  (I will also add here that I think, if  scenario B is correct, the club, Busboys and Poets, as well as Opera Nova, need further investigation.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Nevertheless, IF scenario C were correct, I think we need to be mindful of the potential for libel, either charged toward this website and/or ourselves.   That is why we must phrase things as questions, rather than fact, why we must give every lead the benefit of the doubt.   That is also why I had wanted to archive the video of  Larry King singing Old Man River as previously posted on Opera Nova's Facebook page -- I thought, perhaps, that a voice analysis could be done at a later date to determine IF it was the same person.   I felt this would be a necessary step not only toward establishing irrefutable evidence, but also to avoid LIBEL.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, great job and keep up the good fight!!!   I myself am going
            <s>
             dark
            </s>
            quiet for awhile.
           </p>
           <p>
            God Bless and Good Luck in the meantime.

             No need to go "quiet" for a while we need to amp it up. There is no A or C this is 100% Larry fucking King. Yes, he's still working the DC circles and running underground shit no question. Yes, he's still a sadistic pedofile who preys on kids why do u think he's surrounding himself in kids organizations close to impoverished kids again? Come on. This man is EVIL and he needs to be exposed to everyone. Look at the car dealership and all the workers there in the website pic, now they do not know about him, regular Joe Blows, but the partner of it does, the Opera crap is a front but they know, all the higher up all know what he's about and what he's doing. I strongly believe he's still in the biz of running kids. Do not stand down on this. Do not be afraid. He is a piece of shit.

              Whoa,  I said I was going quiet. I didn't say I was going silent. I just personally feel I have got to work on defense tactics at this point far more so than my offensive tactics.

            I'd bet my last dollar this sadist pedofile is still running kids and knee deep in boys. No way he's changed his sick ways. No fucking way. This man is EVIL SICK and VILE to the core.  This stuff needs to be put everywhere so everyone knows who this fucker really is.  And still working with kids, what a shocking surprise...

            Sounds like a win to me folks. Any chance any of us can  get to ruffle the feathers of these degenerate fucks the better. If they've simply removed him from the site to mask him even further or if they've canned his sponsorship there's two huge points there:
            <em>
             They are aware
            </em>
            and this is a
            <em>
             direct confirmation by default that this is him
            </em>
            !
           </p>

            I'm sure some of you reached out to Opera Nova and I want to say thanks. Hopefully not only has his bio been removed but his person also. He's a monster and this organization has an obligation to protect the children they work with.

              Did you call Opera Nova?  If you did not have time it is OK.  I just want to make sure you are OK.

              Any word? I don't want to call them from my phone so I'm going to go somewhere on my lunch break to place the call and see if they're taking any accountability. Others on voat who reached out... did you get any responses?
