            Hi,
I just found out this thread as I was surfing on a whistleblower I'm following.
At first, I couldn't believe what the Anon guy from Bellinzona which ID is N°993383 said..but after a few checks,  it's is incredibly well documented..everything, everyone is linked ! 
I beg you to continue to spread the word..
As I've read in the forum, I'm opening a pronto mail, installing Tails ( I'm a beginner) and I already use Tor !  Yesterday I was searching for some documents and found out some really interesting facts (ex police officer ...) wich is linked to pedostuff ( as I knew from his deceased spouse.....( I know for sure he is..very difficult to track.
 Funny HOW google provides you with articles relating to their police records !
I'm not native english, sorry if my english is not fluent as your, but I read both spanish and french..
 I had summ up some info , a lot actually..difficult to  link all what I've read..but at least it proves the Anon noble guy doesn't say bullshits;
let me expose some of my search from information : 
As an Anon wrote, Switzerland is the Cabal Hotspot. 
When the Templers came back the 1. August 1291 after they robbed and killed thousands of inNocent People in Europe. Why are they so wealthy and divided?4 Languages for a small Country..? Like Belgium..remind me Antwoort, Diutroux, Verlinde, and so on..such a small country, so divided ! 
If you check for bellizona
            <a href="https://www.bellinzonese-altoticino.ch/fr/scopri/patrimonio-UNESCO/castelli.html">

            and yes the link to the Jpeg provided leads to recognize Pedo symbolism everywhere on their site. They have a Rates card that doesn't make sense until read like a pedo price tag.Redirect here:

            Thanks to " Piscina" (edited 5 days ago) who made a great job : here are some info gathered : 
Bellinzona has a serpent as its coat of arms

            Ivan Ambrosini is the first person he mentions. Ivan is married with a son. He has an economics degree from Uni of Switzerland. He has been active in the Scouts (has access to children) and Assocazione Magno.

             http://www.ppd-bellinzona.ch/info-candidato/

            are Bellinzona and Terris.
When I look up Assoc Magno i find this. Look at all the little hands in big hands here. It teaches English to children of badante (which are eastern European women who are live-in housekeepers) and does after-school care to vulnerable children.

            Bellinzona is in Switzerland, near Lake Como where Clooney has his house. A while back someone said Switzerland was a big place for elite pedos...can't remember who it was. (said Piscina) ! 
Vanni Bianconi is the director of Babel Literary Festival. He lives in Ticino and London. He is an actor.

            . This article says that a Swiss court found Ticino politician guilty of trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            After checking, it appears that Lisa Bosia Mirra Court confirms guilt of immigrant-helping politician
with her advocate, type name Pascal Delprete who has his lawyer office situated in  Lugano 
31.4 km. About 35 mins far from Bellizona city ! 
and u'll find out this : L’ex-chef de la compliance de la banque PKB sera jugé à…https://gothamcity.ch/lex-chef-de-la-compliance-de-la-banque-pkb-sera-juge-a-bellinzone/ 
Selon un acte d’accusation que Gotham City a consulté, un ancien responsable de la conformité de la banque zurichoise est accusé d’avoir tardé à dénoncer une relation bancaire suspecte en 2011.

            Other article of interest , Feel free to google translate the following article apparently only in french on the site 
a bit disturbing !
            <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/fre/rapport-d-intersos_pour-les-migrants-mineurs--c-est-le-jeu-de-l-oie/43867134">

            "The Noble Anon" said they're particing in small cities..."Always small wealthy towns never big cities (that I am aware of)"I know of these:
•	Bellinzona (my old home)
•	Deauville ( As I m concerned, I know Deauville and actually searching for some undergrounds at least city hosts every year the American Movie festival ..(and it is a jews' nest) 
•	Ingolstatd
•	Schagen
•	Brighton
he added : "Also there are some towns in Russia, Israel, Morocco, and many many in Ukraine but I dont know the towns I have only heard they do the same thing. Local police protect it that I saw in Bellinzona but I do not know how it is operating elsewhere sorry". I have posted names, and I am thinking of dates that politicians were at parties but I have to check family facebook posts for dates (I will do that now) but also the Teris company, and the babel literature tour, they are the businesses that do it. Oh and theres a bank I forget the name of that moves the money, they help organize the festival. I will find the name "
By the way he said he knew Macron flew to Bellizona on June 26th of 2018, which is accurate as this Rotschild' son of the beast (known to be a sexual pervert) was in Vatican at that time. ( I can provide with some disturbing pics about Macron ).
please, read : June 26 last year Macron flew in to Bellinzona on the Italian PM helicopter (dont know if Italian PM was there) and he didn't go to a party, but had a private villa and pedo party.
August 10th last year Adam Sandler and the chick from friends was at a 'before' party in the city's ballroom. The pedo party happens after, because the ballroom has a basement that is linked to the city waste tunnels.
Theresa may was there last month, I will find a date, asking my cousin if he can find out the exact date but for now it is just a rumor sorry
Have to check whenever DJ Trump visits Europe and these fucky politicians fly to Asia..
           </p>
           <p>
            Asia is probably a destination.
 As widely known, an ex french minister used to go To Thailand to get kids. (this is not a secret, he wrote it on book on this, got TVinterviews ! 
Check!, Paris is free Masonic city also ! crowded with perverts ! 
Marocco is also a famous destination ( more likely Marrakhech) I think..
Try a search on Bernard Henri Levy..( like "Jacques Attali" who influenced each and every french president, 
or his wife  "Arielle Dombasle"' who just released a movie called Alien Crystal Palace,   satanic erotic movie !
            <a href="https://www.egaliteetreconciliation.fr/Alien-Crystal-Palace-le-film-erotico-sataniste-tragi-comique-d-Arielle-Dombasle-52090.html">

            other disturbing fact , Sandler and Aniston were indeed in Italy last August filming a new film for Netflix, filming was at Lake Como, a mere 39 miles from Bellinzona. Apparently a french famous actor, film maker, producer called Dany Boon, involved with some tax problem solving, friend of Macron appears to hbe linked with both above named persons !

            Is this a version of Rainbow 🌈Cultural Garden? RCG has NXVM connections and at one point Barbara Bush was involved with it’s British location. One description of the language training of the Children was they sounded like Babel. They were being taught many languages each day with hardly any time spent with parents. The outcome was total confusion. One world language of Babel. This scares me.
