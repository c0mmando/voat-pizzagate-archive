            If you start googling William Randolph Hearst it takes two seconds to start finding connections to weird, new age religions and cults like NXIVM. For example William Randolph Hearsts mother was of the Baháʼí Faith, which is a new age religion teaching the essential worth of all religions, and the unity of all people.

            I just got enlightened so thought I'd share , there was a poet/philisiphor named Ovid. ((C)ovid?) and his claim to fame was a 15 vollume ' book' called Metamorphosis, interestingly enough Ovid means Sheep. Are we see in the changing of the sheep with Covid19 , as we know , they love cryptically telling us what's going on.

            As far as the Hearst family, they and the DuPonts were working for Andrew Mellon (Mellon Bank) who controlled 1/5 of the World Bank,so super duper elite.

             This all looks relevant to pizzagate to me, especially the part about brainwashing:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Brainwashing claims
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              At the time of her arrest, Hearst's weight had dropped to 87 pounds (40 kg), and she was described by Dr. Margaret Singer in October 1975 as "a low-IQ, low-affect zombie".[38] Shortly after her arrest, signs of trauma were recorded: her IQ was measured as 112, whereas it had previously been 130; there were huge gaps in her memory regarding her pre-Tania life; she was smoking heavily and had nightmares.[39] Without a mental illness or defect, a person is considered to be fully responsible for any criminal action not done under duress, which is defined as a clear and present threat of death or serious injury.[40][41] But for Hearst to secure an acquittal on the grounds of having been brainwashed would have been completely unprecedented.[42][43]
             </p>
             <p>
              Psychiatrist Louis Jolyon West, a professor at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), was appointed by the court in his capacity as a brainwashing expert and worked without a fee. After the trial, he wrote a newspaper article asking President Carter to release Hearst from prison.[44]
             </p>
             <p>
              Hearst wrote in her memoir, Every Secret Thing (1982), "I spent fifteen hours going over my SLA experiences with Robert Jay Lifton of Yale University. Lifton, author of several books on coercive persuasion and thought reform, ... pronounced me a 'classic case' which met all the psychological criteria of a coerced prisoner of war. ... If I had reacted differently, that would have been suspect, he said."[45]
             </p>
             <p>
              After some weeks, Hearst repudiated her SLA allegiance.[9][46]
             </p>
             <p>
              Her first lawyer, Terence Hallinan, had advised Hearst not to talk to anyone, including psychiatrists. He advocated a defense of involuntary intoxication: that the SLA had given her drugs that affected her judgment and recollection.[47][10][42][48][page needed]
             </p>
             <p>
              He was replaced by attorney F. Lee Bailey, who asserted a defense of coercion or duress affecting intent at the time of the offense.[49] This was similar to the brainwashing defense which Hallinan had warned was not a defense in law. Hearst gave long interviews to various psychiatrists.[40]

             This also needs a connection to abuse of minors to satisfy Rule 1. I don't think Patty Hearst was a minor when she got involved.

              This makes no sense. NXIVM, a group that
              <em>
               abused countless minors
              </em>
              had dossiers on Hearst. That creates a connection between Hearst and the abuse of minors.  This is the second time in less than 24 hours that you have covered for someone with a direct connection to NXIVM.

             At her trial the prosecution said that she had joined this group of her own free will. But she denied it and said she had been forced through death threats, sexual abuse, being held in close confinement and was brainwashed.

            The Symbionese Liberation Army was a CIA MKUltra project on a large scale, just as Jim Jones and The People's Temple was. Patty Hearst was considered "fallout" and collateral damage to the evil CIA who perpetrated it. Patty Hearst was a victim of mind control and only went to prison because of a corrupt justice system and CIA subornation of everyone involved. Everyone in the country knew she was non compos mentis at the bank robbery.

            You should look into it further. It's incredible reading. Mae Brussell discusses both in some length.

             They also kept dossiers on people such as Roger Stone

            Woud you have link regarding the dossier about Roger Stone - thanks. This would maybe explain why he worked for them for a couple of months.
           </p>
           <p>
            He and his wife were swingers, and he identifies as 'tri-sexual' - when asked about it, he said he had 'tried everything' sexually. .
           </p>
           <p>
            Considering that he was, like Donald Trump, a mentee of Roger Stone, who ran a child sex trafficking and blackmail ring for the CIA, it would be interesting to know whether they had footage showing how rhe raped boys.

            On a sidenote, you will need to add a link anyway, because otherwise the mods will flair the post. ;-)

            Hearst also owns DigitalSpy forums, which had a zero reaction to the NXIVM story despite being a forum focused on television and showbiz.
