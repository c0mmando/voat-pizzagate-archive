<p>Fox recently cut a scene from Shane Black\'s upcoming  after the studio found out it featured a registered sex offender.</p>
<p>In 2010, Steven Wilder Striegel pleaded guilty to risk of injury to a child and enticing a minor by after he faced allegations that he attempted to lure a 14-year-old into a sexual relationship. Striegel served six months in jail.</p>
<p>A  report says that the studio was made aware of Steigel\'s background after star Olivia Munn, who is featured in Striegel\'s one scene in the reboot, brought it to Fox\'s attention. Munn says that Black did not share any information about Striegel\'s background at any point in the production of the sci-fi thriller. </p>
<p>&quot;Our studio was not aware of Mr. Striegel\'s background when he was hired,&quot; said a 20th Century Fox spokesperson in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. &quot;Several weeks ago, when the studio learned the details, his one scene in the film was removed within 24 hours. We were not aware of his background during the casting process due to legal limitations that impede studios from running background checks on actors.&quot;</p>
<p>Striegel, a friend of Black\'s, has appeared in the director\'s other films Iron Man 3 and Nice Guys. He has a small scene in The Predator as a jogger that repeatedly hits on Munn\'s character. In a statement to the L.A. Times, Black wrote: &quot;I personally chose to help a friend. I can understand others might disapprove, as his conviction was on a sensitive charge and not to be taken lightly.&quot;</p>
<p>Also stars Boyd Holbrook, Sterling K. Brown and Jacob Tremblay. The film is set to premiere Thursday night at the Toronto International Film Festival and will hit theaters Sept. 14.</p>
<p>Pizzagate related because Hollywood is under control of CIA/Deep State and this actor who is under their control has committed the horrible act of sexual abuse of a child.</p>',

             I know.  Sounds nuts.  What in the world keeps them from checking their backgrounds.  I have never heard of this.  Sounds insane.  One of those little bylines added to protect the guilty and  Another backdoor for them to run out of.

               We think alike.  Where they are concerned, we know that it is one or the other.  Just a last minute tweak that a politician or LE inserted while no one was looking.  We know all to well how that can happen.

                Yeah as long as they have an excuse that they can speak out loud, they assume that people are going to believe they're not lying. Because accusing someone of blatantly lying is taboo.

            She is dishing  big dirt on me and trying hard to take me down. Along with Sarah, Fiona and Howie! howie and her used to be good friends.
           </p>
           <p>
            Catherine has posted here in the past in full support of me, so what has happened to make her changer her mind?
This is causing me extreme anxiety as i have an immigration case before the ninth circuit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Catherine has threatened to expose me to ICE. Some one has got to her.
           </p>
           <p>
            Her entire blog is trying to discredit me.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am not sure how to handle this, so can you help me here researchers?  I am losing my mind all over again and i have been through enough.

             Becki Percy, what did you expect when a family allowed you into their home and you directly put their children in danger, did you expect they would give you hugs and kisses for endangering their children?  Why make public appeals for support over harm you have done to families and children? Grow up please and stop playing the victim.

             Becki, I'm so sorry this is happening to you. I have read her blog but it's not clear.  The first thing to do is look after yourself. Anxiety can be quite crippling. If it's getting more than you can handle, see a doctor who can prescribe something for you and help you to sleep.  Meditation is very helpful for anxiety. If you have people around you who you can lean on, lean on them. Don't isolate yourself; talk to someone.    Take some little comfort in knowing that she is also attacking  Fiona and Howie. Perhaps reach out to Fiona if you can. She may have some good advice for you. I'm praying for you.

              Thank you so much, sister.  Fiona is furious about this. We was just having a conversation on the phone last night. It helped me. I just can't understand why I am being victimized all over again. I think ICE have already been told some bad things about me as they have been sending me strange correspondence. I don't even have an attorney any more, since they was warned off.

               Becki, are you getting some counselling? I know that when someone has been through trauma like yours, it affects every aspect of your life and you tend to ruminate and worry about things.  It's not your fault; it's just the way trauma affects the brain (the amygdala fires up and doesn't stop firing).  It's a probability that Howie had chores to do, so he wasn't trying to get away from you (I don't know Howie and I've never spoken to him).  I will keep you in my prayers.

               I had a conversation with Fiona years ago.  She has stuck to her same story for years, so I think she's the real deal. I'm glad you have her to talk to.  You can support one another.

                Fiona wants me to come and live with her if I get deported. Maybe. 
For now I  am happy sharing Wendy McAvene's bed in Texas. Wendy makes me feel safe, even though ICE might put me on a plane at any time. 
I heard ICE like to come at very early in the morning to raid illegals. My anxiety is through the roof but as our household is breaking up I can't afford counselling. 
Thank you for  your kind thoughts.

                 I wasn't trying to out where you are now, just tying to make sense of the comment about deportation and where that would mean you would have to return to. I hope it doesn't happen and all works out for you.

               My name is James Hind. and I have watched the Becki Percy case for about a year.  I and many others have tried to help Becki Percy by speaking to law enforcement, offering her professional and legal support, but she seems always to reject them, block people and threaten them.
              </p>
              <p>
               Becki Percy makes many allegations on social media such as Twitter that named people have raped her, have raped and killed thousands of children in Hull.  Becki Percy has provided no evidence to support her allegations, and she refuses to speak to law enforcement in the UK to stop the alleged murders and rapes of children and bring alleged criminals to justice.  Becki Percy does not seem to care about the children she alleges is being raped and murdered in the UK.
              </p>
              <p>
               Becki Percy has made it public that she is no longer afraid of the alleged cult in Hull, and that she wants to stop the alleged rapes and killings of children, but then she is more interested in selling candles and bath bombs, fighting for convicted US murderers and going on holiday than helping the children of Hull.  There is only two reasonable explainations: either she is telling fictions; or Becki Percy has been raping and killing children in Hull as part of that alleged cult and is afraid she will go to prison.
              </p>
              <p>
               Of those who have opened their lives and families to Becki Percy, she has put the children of one family in danger with her reckless actions, and she is destroying the marriage of a second family.   Becki Percy seems to be ruining the lives of everyone she comes into contact with.  She needs to come clean and become responsible.  Becki Percy is the agent of her own misfortune.
              </p>
              <p>
               Becki Percy can speak to the cops in Hull UK who are waiting for her to make a statement about alleged crimes against the children of that city: ring UK 01482 220393  quote crime record C732 22-06-18.  Do your duty Becki Percy and report your allegations to the police.

            I don't watch any more Hollywood movies any more. After reading Crazy Days and Nights for a few months, I know that Hollywood is built on the rape and torture of little children (boys and girls)  and women.  Black should have said no to him from the outset.  Munn should not be required to police who is on the set.

             We don't go to the theater anymore either.  We have pulled the plug as well on cable and no Netflix.  After finding out about R Howard and THanks well, I really woke up.  They don't police.  But now they know we are watching and that is a Good Thing.

             It's a club.  They hire each other as a favor.  They are all peos.  If someone knows what they did and still give them a job, well, if the shoe fits.

            This is all bullshit. First of all, he served only 6 months, which is nothing. Second, Fox is now Disney's property, and only Disney have a strict policy against sex offenders. This piece of shit is free to continue abusing children.

             Yes and this is what I am hoping people will see.  Another slap on the wrist.  They are trying to make themselves look like they are policing their stars.  Also I noticed how they did not include the word Child in the Title.  It should read Child Sex Offender.  It is misleading.  People may not even read the article, just believe they have done a good deed.  Yes it is BS.
