<p>This thread is a little difficult to explain in a preface, but, the premise is essentially as follows:</p>
<p>In among all of the corruption, including efforts to investigate by those here and elsewhere, a recurring element in many ways is Russia - a prominent example being the &quot;Russian collusion [with Trump/Clinton]&quot;,</p>
<p>I mention both Trump and Clinton there due to both names coming up in their own ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>On one hand we have a strong push to have people believe that Donald Trump and those connected with him, colluded with Russians(inc. Putin) in order to rig the 2016 election.</li>
<li>On the other hand we have mounting evidence to suggest that Hillary Clinton and those connected to her, have been far more involved with Russians and in a more sinister context than anything involving Donald Trump.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even my own research has brought up Russia-related curiosities, especially relevant to the subject of election fraud(linked to Democrats, with even elements of pedophilia)[0]. Many recent events on the global stage also have strong relevance to Russia, for example, the cases of people being poisoned in the UK being blamed on Putin/Russia &amp; also including accusations that Russians shot down MH17. Other examples exist and I could go on to talk about the Helsinki summit and other recent events, but, that\'s not exactly the direction I want to go with this.</p>
<p>The underlying point is that looking at the past and present, there\'s no denying that Russia is an important and consistenly present factor in the investigation of global corruption.</p>
<p>What I\'m going to attempt to lay out here is a variety of events and curiosities which appear to link up with and perhaps explain some of these recurring Russia-related elements, in the broader scheme of Hollywood corruption and human trafficking, pedophilia, strange/suspicious deaths, war/terrorism, etc. Indeed, I will also be touching on the subject of the Ottomans again.</p>
<hr />

<p><strong>Summary points from end of comment 8/8:</strong></p>

<p>Again, call me crazy, but, it seems as though we\'re looking at collusion between nefarious parties including Ottomans(and/or loyalists thereto), Scientology and NXIVM.</p>

<p>It seems apparent that Michael Avenatti is playing a very active role within this network of corruption involving the above and other elements discussed in this entry and previous entries - keeping in mind also: Q posts 1752 - 1761...</p>
<p>I have no reason to suspect Paris Hilton of wrongdoing, moreover, I believe that she is being used/exploited.</p>
<p>The death of Muammar Gaddafi appears to be inherently connected to all of this and I feel that the pieces here begin to paint a clear picture as to who wanted him dead and why Hillary Clinton was so cheerful in her statement, &quot;We came, we saw, he died&quot;</p>
<p>I think a lot of what has been explored here, seems part of why there is such a push to constantly cast Russia in a negative light; to drum up Cold-War-esque paranoia and otherwise deflect attention away from the reality of the conflict and human-rights abuses in Eurasia and Africa &amp; also to hinder economic and peace related processes in these regions.</p>
<p><em>I\'ll finish this entry up here at this point, with a bit of room left over for updates/additional info.</em></p>
