<p>OP\'s summary at the time:</p>
<p>&quot;I was watching the film &quot;Bad Neighbors&quot; on Netflix last night, when I noticed that for around the entire first third of the film Seth Rogan is wearing this Wolfgang T-shirt (the clothing brand of Tyler the Creator) which contains the odd imagery of \'wolfgang\' in the style of what seems to be a cartoonish pizza parlor sign... Under this there is an equation of symbols that seems to depict &quot;Rocket - Pizza = Boy&quot;. I found this particularly odd as throughout the beginning of the film while this shirt is worn the characters have sex in front their own baby, decide to take the baby out partying with them in a chant of \'Baby first rave\' and then leave the baby unattended in their home for the entire night to join the frat party next door where they stay till the morning getting \'comically\' intoxicated on numerous psychedelic drugs, and alcohol. These acts by themselves seemed to me clear child abuse and I found no humour in their depiction despite the film advertising itself as a comedy. Following a screenshot of the T-shirt I typed into DuckDuckGo, &quot;Wolfgang rocket - pizza = boy&quot; and could not believe the results. Link after link to &quot;gay young boy porn videos\' on sites like pornhub. I typed in absolutely nothing sexual to receive these results only the simple yet odd symbol equation depicted on Seth Rogan\'s shirt. These symbols obviously have hidden meaning representing very sinister themes that people are certainly intentionally using. How is this is so open for all to see ?&quot;</p>
<p>link to web-search result: <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/Lb31ga7">http://imgur.com/gallery/Lb31ga7</a></p>
<p>&quot;EDIT: I realized that the porn results are much more prevalent in the search when you type in &quot;Golfwang Rocket - Pizza = Boy&quot;. Adding &quot;Golfwang&quot; to the equation brings slightly different search results.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&quot;Golfwang&quot; and &quot;Wang&quot; are actually two completely different entries into a search engine alogrithm. That is like googling &quot;pizzagate&quot; and expecting pictures of actual gates to show up in the search engine.... &quot;Golfwang&quot; is the clothing brand of Tyler the creator, if you search for the word &quot;Golfwang&quot; alone this will not lead you to any porn as you would not expect it to. It is the combination of adding the said equation on Seth Rogan\'s shirt that alters the results.&quot;</p>
<p>comments by other users:</p>
<p>&quot;This post just made me think of a seth rogan side note:</p>
<p>Broad City Season 2 Episode 1 &quot;In Heat&quot;</p>
<p>Seth rogan guest stars and gets \'raped\' by Abby after he passes out from the heat whilst having sex. later in the episode Illana and Abby hunt down an air conditioner in their old dorm room and end up getting high and \'partying\' with the dorms current residents except after making out with one of the boys they learn this kid is literally still a kid in high school just visiting thus underage.</p>
<p>Rape + Pedophilia + Seth = coincidental? probably. a reoccurring hollyweird theme? definitely.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The backwards N on his shirt is used when someone is trying to tell you to crack a code. Weird as shit&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;from some webpage - The shirt Seth Rogen is wearing in the above image (while playing Mac in Neighbors) is an Odd Future store shirt. It has the address of the store on it; 410 N Fairfax (Los Angeles, CA). I couldn’t find this shirt anywhere; I don’t think it i produced any longer.</p>
<p>also ck out Tylerthe creator on twitter.</p>
<p>or Golf Wang Tees - 410N Fairfax (CA)&quot;</p>
<p>This needs some work but might be worth a dig ? (Re-post as messed up the first one). </p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/u/Zen0">u/Zen0</a> had already checked the address: </p>
<p>&quot;when you type in the address on google maps it takes you to a vacant building right next to an italian take out place, Jon and Vinny\'s&quot;</p>',

            Remember the feud between Rogen and Bieber. Wherein Bieber, 16 at the time I think, didn't "bow-down" to the mighty comedic genius Rogen, and subsequently Rogen went on Howard Stern and called Bieber a Piece of Shit.

            Bieber came back with a brilliant back-handed apology. You can take it as a She Said / He Said or a She Said / She Said thing, but Rogen's activities with Efron and Franco are decidedly homo-erotic and not in a good, bro kind of way like the characters in the

            From fart jokes to pedophilia, he rocketed from a fat Joo to a Hollywood fat Joo.

             Don't disparage fart jokes! They are the essence (sic) of humor, from caveman days, long before people had language.

             I don't. I don't even know who these people are, which is why I posted this here, hoping that someone with more knowledge would pick this up. Read the text. It's from a redditor who posted this quite some time ago, but it never really was acknowledged.

            Seeing Seth thrust into the very end of Anchorman always felt forced.  Seeing all of them try to do a Boogie Nights gay version in King Cobra was probably based on their experiences in pedowood.

              Oh man, my computer just crashed trying to look into this, for no reason. Only had voat open, the restaurant websites, their twitter, and catbox for saving screenshots. And now half the tweets that jumped out at me are gone. Is that even possible ?
             </p>
             <p>
              This is how I found the posts on Twitter:

              Does "Steven Weintraub" ring a bell ?

              Also, when you go to the restaurant website, the pic facing the street shows a bed / mattres store.

               I did not have to go far to see a lot of gay friendly stuff (normal?) in that place. Some names popped up though, Kim Kardashian, Jennifer Aniston, and Jessica Alba are really into baby2baby. It got weird pretty quick. Trois petite is three small, as in the three little pigs. Menage a trois is a threesome. Mec trois is three men. Usual cities they come from Chicago and NY.

            Definitely some digging to do with Tyler the Creator. Seems to photographed eating Pizza rather frequently. Also has a collaborative song titled "Pizza Boi"

            He had that whole flower boy album where he apparently "came out," which is the Kevin Spacey way of saying people are pointing out my connections to pedophilia.

             Hello my friend, I applaud your investigative work!
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm just dropping by to clarify that the YouTube link you posted to "Pizza Boi" is not a collaborative effort, yet it's a so-called "type beat". These instrumental beats are marketed using well-known artist names to gain traction and increase sales.
            </p>
            <p>
             Good job though, keep digging!

             Look how dark red that stain is in the bottom of the box. That's not the color of tomato sauce. Pizza doesn't look like it's barbecue either. Nasty.
