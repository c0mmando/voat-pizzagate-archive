<p>Just today I came across videos of former Special Investigator for the CPS, Carlos Morales exposing the CPS in great detail. His speeches and interviews should be part of the pedogate canon. This is just a short sample of what Morales reveals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A foster parent was found guilty when an 11 year old boy was found handcuffed to a porch <strong>with a dead chicken around his neck</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children handled by CPS are put on psychotropic drugs at a rate of 3x what they would be if not put into the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>85% of removals are <strong>not</strong> for physical or sexual abuse. These cases mostly involve parents admitting to marijuana or other drug use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foster children are 7x to 8x more likely to suffer physical, sexual, and psychological abuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>majority</strong> of our nation\'s homeless population were at one point foster children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More likely to suffer from PTSD than vets (and less likely to recover from it)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These children are <strong>6x more likely to die</strong> than if they remained in their homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The child of a marijuana activist had his child taken (for influence on this child, not usage of drugs) and the child died within two weeks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigators are actively trained from the start to think the worst about the biological parents (possibly to encourage more severe actions such as removal of children?).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigators ask child as young as five if they <strong>consent</strong> to being recorded and if the children don\'t answer, the investigators are encouraged to assert to the child that they should answer, &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are zero incentives for a CPS worker not to make false allegations (no consequences for being wrong).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Law enforcement sometimes goes out to force children in CPS custody to take drugs/medicine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CPS gets $4,000 every time they remove a child</strong> from a home (on top of the lack of consequences for being wrong).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My apologies if these videos have been posted before. If they have, I simply hope they get some additional views this time around and that they are shared more widely.</p>
