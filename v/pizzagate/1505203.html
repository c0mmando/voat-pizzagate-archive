<p>According to the Washington Free Beacon, Haddad’s tenure at the Clinton Foundation actually “overlapped with his official work for the Muslim Brotherhood, which began in Cairo in February 2011 when he assumed control of the Renaissance Project, a Brotherhood-backed economic recovery program.” Egyptian media describe the Renaissance Project as a program designed to implement the radical Islamization of Egyptian society. As the Egypt Independent reported in 2012: “Renaissance is far more than the electoral program of [Egyptian] President Mohamed Morsi or the Brotherhood’s political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party. It is a 25-year project to reform state, business and civil society, rooted in the Brotherhood’s Islamic values but conditioned by the experiences of the project’s founders in the modern economy.... [Haddad] officially became a senior adviser for foreign affairs in Morsi’s Freedom and Justice Party in May 2011, when he was still claiming to be employed by the Clinton Foundation.”</p>
<p>In Egyptian media during Morsi\'s tenure as president, Haddad was a frequent apologist for the Brotherhood’s violent crackdowns on civil liberties throughout the country. In September 2013 Haddad was arrested by Egyptian authorities in an ongoing roundup of seditious Islamist militants. Eric Trager, a Fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and an expert on Egyptian affairs, said: “It was only a matter of time before Gehad el-Haddad was arrested. Many of the other Muslim Brotherhood spokesmen have been apprehended, and in addition to decapitating the organization, the military-backed government has been specifically targeting the Brotherhood’s media wing, including by shutting down its TV stations at the time of [Egyptian President Mohammed] Morsi’s ouster on July 3. It has also gone after those connected to Morsi’s presidential office, and Gehad’s father is Morsi adviser and Muslim Brotherhood Guidance Office member Essam el-Haddad.”</p>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "You can’t come up with concrete solutions unless you have a compass to tell you what’s right or wrong," Haddad told the Egypt Independent. "For us, that compass is Islam. We believe its mission is to change people’s lives.”
            </p>
            <p>
             It is unclear if Clinton Foundation donors are aware that their donations have been used to train Islamic terrorists determined to snuff out individual rights and civil society.
            </p>
            <p>
             Those who support the Global War on Terror should bear in mind that Haddad's experience at the Clinton Foundation gave him the know-how to help build the terror apparatus, police state, and other oppressive institutions that would be required to turn Egypt into a totalitarian theocracy, which is the Brotherhood's goal.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Clinton Foundation's Climate Initiative, which he worked on in Egypt, "taught Haddad about managing [a nongovernmental organization] and the role that civil society takes between the state and private sector, lessons he is applying to the Renaissance Project,” according to the Egypt Independent.
            </p>
            <p>
             Haddad "officially became a senior adviser for foreign affairs in Morsi’s Freedom and Justice Party in May 2011, when he was still claiming to be employed by the Clinton Foundation," the news website reports.
            </p>
            <p>
             In Egyptian media, Haddad was a frequent apologist for the Brotherhood's violent crackdowns on civil liberties in the Arab republic. He put his spin doctoring skills to use last December to downplay Brotherhood supporters' attacks on women and children.
            </p>
            <p>
             When pro-democracy protests swept Egypt on June 30, Hadded called the demonstrators violent thugs. “The anti-Morsi camp are providing a political endorsement to the violence,” he told the Washington Free Beacon at that
            </p>
            <p>
             time. “Some have resorted to violence because they didn’t do well at the ballot box.”

             Pizzagate encompasses the whole Clinton Foundation, CHAI, CGI, etc and the Podesta's lobbying efforts of influence by foreign nations. It is obviously why it was so imperative that H become the DNC nominee and return a clinton to the white house.

             The destabilizing of a region (which was the apparent task of Haddad) is standard operating procedure for seizing national assets including oil, gold, children etc, &amp; for the traffficing of weapons and opening new markets for their cf related charities.
