             This was a few years ago. There was a guy I think ASU that was going around in apt laundry rooms and stealing girls or women's panties. Took awhile but they caught him. They are really sick and deranged perverts.

             Yes. It's just like the panties that used to hang from the mirror in 'lucky" guys pickup trucks.  It was mandatory decoration for serious crew cut hot rod owners.  Haven't seen one in a while. It's solid proof of conquest.

             For the person being abused, it's other worldly, you learn how to float away, detach you mind from your body in self protection.  For the abuser it's equally other worldly but of a different sort.  This is not going to be your standard afternoon nap, they chuckle.  The manly grin is the ticket inside these groups.  Want to get in? You got to grin.

             Looking back later, a group rape participant may wonder to themselves, maybe I was dreaming, for sure I was drunk.   Did it really happen?  In the larger group they gain bragging rights. But those who were involved must show some proof.  They like owning a map, to show themselves and others, yes, for sure that really happened and I got the goods to prove it. The more maps a member collects the more power they hold.
            </p>

             It's the blood.  That's the evidence they want, most of all.  They will cut you to get it if your already stretched from prior abuse and not tearing as needed. Why was it always an electricians folding knife?  They super glue the cut closed. Kids heal fast under hypnosis, in hours.  The pill keeps you from remembering, but not forever.  That's a long time eternity.
