<p>Mrs. Potato Head Lyrics</p>
<p>If you weren\'t born with it You can buy a couple ornaments Just be sure to read the warning, kids \'Cause pretty soon you\'ll be bored of it Sexual, hey girl if you wanna feel sexual You can always call up a professional They stick pins in you like a vegetable</p>
<p>Kids forever, kids forever Baby soft skin turns into leather Don\'t be dramatic it\'s only some plastic No one will love you if you\'re unattractive</p>
<p>Oh Mrs. Potato Head tell me, is it true that pain is beauty? Does a new face come with a warranty? Will a pretty face make it better? Oh Mr. Potato Head tell me How did you afford her surgery? Do you swear you\'ll stay forever Even if her face don\'t stay together Even if her face don\'t stay together</p>
<p>If you want a little more confidence Potatoes turn to french fries, yeah it\'s common sense All you need\'s a couple more condiments And a hundred thousand dollars for some compliments It\'s such a waste When little girls grow into their mothers face But little girls are learning how to cut and paste And pucker up their lips until they suffocate1</p>
<p>Kids forever kids forever Baby soft skin turns into leather Don\'t be dramatic it\'s only some plastic No one will love you if you\'re unattractive</p>

            I spent all morning writing a long, well researched blog post about Popstar Melanie Martinez. Everything is sourced. It's called:
            <strong>
             <a href="http://pizzagateblog.blogspot.se/2017/03/does-melanie-martinez-promote-pedophilia.html">
              Does Popstar Melanie Martinez Promote Pedophilia?

           </p>
           <p>
            Pleasure read it, I spent about 5 hours on it.
