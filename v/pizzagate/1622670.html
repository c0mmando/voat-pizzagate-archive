            this guy lives and works in canada, had a Red7 production company and founded the RedSeven Charitable Foundation for youths. Also worked for S-Trip! (Student Trip), a "non-stop action day and night. The only way to celebrate the end of high school with all of your friends." Currently works for "I love Travel", the "leader in student youth and travel"
