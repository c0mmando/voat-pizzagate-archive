            Dr. Catherine Keesling
Catherine M. Keesling is Associate Professor in the Department of Classics. She has received fellowships from the NEH, the Archaeological Institute of America, the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, the Fulbright Foundation, and the Mellon Foundation. She is currently President of the American Society of Greek and Latin Epigraphy and Chair of the Admissions and Fellowships Committee of the ASCSA. Her publications include The Votive Statues of the Athenian Acropolis (Cambridge 2003), as well as articles and book chapters on Greek sculpture and epigraphy of the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods.
La Barbera
Dr. Sandro La Barbera
Professor La Barbera's interests lie predominantly in the field of Latin literature, especially poetry from Mid-Republic to the first centuries of the Empire, usually keeping an eye or two on Greek literature. He does not disdain occasional incursions into the Latin literature of Late Antiquity and the Renaissance since his perspective on ancient texts encompasses both the study of how ancient texts survived and the literary interactions between authors and genres during the history of literature. You may contact Professor La Barbera at

Lamb
Professor Ismini Lamb
Ismini Lamb directs the Modern Greek Studies Program where she teaches all levels of Modern Greek language and courses on Greek culture, including an introduction to Byzantine History and Civilization and a course on The Orthodox Faith in Greek Culture. Ismini cultivates student appreciation of the Greek language and culture and its continuity from antiquity to the present. Her special interests include the profound influence of Greek media and political ethos on Greek national identity and expression, and social and humanitarian issues in contemporary Greece. Ismini is the long-standing advisor to Georgetownâs student Hellenic association and also a C.S. Lewis Fellow. Currently she is writing a biography of the American philhellene, author, diplomat and activist, George Horton.
McNelis
Dr. Charles McNelis
Professor McNelis primarily teaches courses in Greek and Roman literature, both in translation and in the original languages. He is particularly interested in the epic poetry of authors such as Homer and Vergil and their portrayals of human endeavor within political and religious contexts. The literature in translation courses take as a starting point the ways in which other ancient artists (e.g. Euripides, Ovid, Lucan, Apuleius) and/or literary genres (elegy, satire, drama) poignantly responded to and transformed these culturally powerful texts. Study of stylistic and thematic points of these texts in Greek and Latin affords an even deeper understanding of these works. These kinds of intellectual concerns are reflected in many of his publications, including his book entitled 'Statius' Thebaid and the Poetics of Civil War' (Cambridge, 2007) and his ongoing commentary on Statius' Achilleid, a poem which takes as its subject Achilles, the greatest Greek hero.
Nichols
Dr. Marden Nichols
Professor Nichols primarily teaches courses in Latin literature and Roman art and archaeology. Her published research concerns Roman domestic decor and the moral discourse of luxury, the authorial personae of Horace and Vitruvius, the satirist Persius, and the reception history of plaster cast replicas of classical art. Her first book, on Vitruviusâ De architectura, is forthcoming from Cambridge University Press.
Osgood
Dr. Josiah Osgood
Professor Osgoodâs research covers many areas of Roman history and Latin literature, with a special focus on the late Roman Republic and early empire. He is the author of several books, including Caesar's Legacy: Civil War and the Emergence of the Roman Empire (Cambridge, 2006), which explores the civil war that followed the assassination of Julius Caesar and the way it was treated in contemporary literature, and Turia: A Roman Woman's Civil War (Oxford, 2014), which argues that Roman women had a distinctive experience of civil war. He is presently working on a historical survey, Rome from Republic to Empire (150 BC - AD 20). Professor Osgood enjoys teaching Latin at all levels and in 2011 published a textbook A Suetonius Reader in the Bolchazy-Carducci Latin Readers series. Each year in collaboration with Georgetown's Office of Global Education he leads a two-week study tour in Rome.

            Pedrick
Dr. Victoria Pedrick
Professor Pedrick primarily teaches courses in Greek and Latin language and literature, with a particular interest in Archaic and Classical Greek literature and culture. She also teaches an introduction to Classical myth. In all her courses, she encourages students to focus on the audience and cultural contexts for ancient texts, including when appropriate modern engagement. She has published essays on Homer, Greek Tragedy, and Latin Lyric as well as two volumes on tragedy, one a collection of essays and the other a study of Euripides and Freud.
Philbrick
Dr. Rachel Philbrick
Professor Philbrick primarily teaches courses in Latin language and literature, as well as courses on Classical literature in translation. Her research interests lie in the poetry of the Hellenistic and early Imperial periods, especially literary constructions of and responses to the geography of empire. She has written most extensively on the poetry of Ovid, including his treatment of myth and his exilic works.
Sens
Dr. Alexander Sens
Professor Sens primarily teaches courses in Greek and Latin language and literature. He is particularly interested in the way that poets locate themselves in an ongoing literary tradition by alluding to and engaging with the works of their predecessors. In courses in translation, he is interested in introducing students to the ways in which ancient authors both created and played with the boundaries of genre. His goal is for students at all levels to be able to think independently about the ways in which ancient authors defined their own projects against the background of the various literary traditions they were working with.
