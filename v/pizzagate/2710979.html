<p>EDIT: Thanks to <a href="https://voat.co/user/Yuke">@Yuke</a> for adding this. We now have the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tham_Luang_cave_rescue#Responses">wiki page</a> of the rescue with Vern stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vern Unsworth, a British caver mapping the cave, stated, &quot;Nobody’s to blame, not the coach, not the boys. They were just very unlucky ... It wasn’t just the rain that day, the mountain is like a sponge and waters from earlier rain were raising the levels&quot;. Unsworth said that he himself had been planning to make a solo venture into the complex on 24 June, when he received a telephone call saying the boys were missing there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The boys went in to the cave on the 23rd of June.. What are the chances he was taking a solo trip in there the next day? Yuke also pointed out that the cave leads to the border of Myanmar, the boys were headed in the direction of the border. </p>
<p>Were the boys meant to be taken to a camp within the cave, then the next day Vern, Sawyer an Co. were to take the boys across the border in to Myanmar to then be taken to fuck knows where? They were almost 3 miles in! That\'s not a &quot;quick walk after training&quot;.</p>',

            Sorry again to burst your bubble of insanity regarding Thailand. I know of one of the cave divers (diving school instructor) and the event was 100% real. The Thai government doesn't engage in Psyops/ False Flags and has no history of having done so. Four of the boys including the coach are from Myanamar they are not Thai citizens. The boarder is in effect porous between the two countries as it extends for more than 2200Km. There are border points at Maesai/ Tachelek which the boys live nearby. Daily hundreds of people cross the border backwards and forwards, though children without papers wouldn't be allowed to cross at that point, so they would just cross the river elsewhere if they wanted to make a trip back home.
           </p>
           <p>
            The are some NGO's here who sadly make a living from pretending that every adult from a neighboring country who comes over the border for work has been "trafficked". Its what gets them those 503c donations to keep them in luxury. Meanwhile, of course they do next to nothing with the money they rake in, and or are infiltrated by foreign agencies.
           </p>
           <p>
            In Thailand most Western Pedos were kicked out years ago - any they suspect just get put on the black list. Its a fully computerized national system with facial recognition etc..  the days when people could just go home change their name and come back on a new passport are over. So Thailand is not a desirable Pedo destination these days.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is still a local Thai problem but compared to Western countries its small and tends to occur in the outer fringes of society. I shared the story here a while back of one brave friend who was part of a bust for an under age girl place. So it does occur but the government cracks down wherever it arises.
           </p>
           <p>
            Elan Musk was just pissed that he couldn't get to play the hero (Classic Narcissist) so when thwarted he lashes out in order to keep himself at the center of  attention of it all. For sure he will loose in court...

            <p>
             According to a Reuters article I posted above:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Attention has also focused on Ek’s status in Thailand.
            </p>
            <p>
             He is a member of the Tai Lue minority, one of several groups whose people have over generations moved around the region, across open borders in remote hills between southern China, Myanmar and Laos, and into northern Thailand’s ethnic patchwork of communities.
            </p>
            <p>
             Many such people do not have Thai citizenship papers and are officially stateless."
            </p>
            <p>
             You tried and failed to make one think the boys and coach were citizens of Myanamar. THEY WERE STATELESS. Perfect targets for trafficking. I'm sure that cave system has been known and nefariously used for GENERATIONS. Probably used for drug trafficking as well.

              The coaches parents live in Myanmar and the coach was born there - therefore he is a citizen of Myanmar. And if he chose to walk into a Myanmar immigration office they would issue him with a Myanmar Workers ID + and a few days later a passport like they do for millions of Myanmar workers in Thailand.

               Where is your documentation? Links?  I think Reuter's was doing a cover job. They knew it would come out that the "coach" and soccer players were not Tai citizens, so they put out a spin ahead of the news, garnering sympathy for these "stateless" youth.

               Golden Triangle: Thailand, Laos, Myanmar (Google maps)
"Golden triangle compassing parts of Thailand, Laos, Myanmar/Burma, and Yunnan province of China has been well-known as opium producing region in mass media and history text books all over the world. How and when the opium came to this region is much less known or interested. However now peoples can see some insight into the history of opium at the Hall of Opium located on the Thai side of Golden Triangle."

Mostly of Yunnese origin, they moved from Myanmar into northern Thailand in the early196o’s and settled settled in the region, primarily but not exclusively in Doi Mae Salong (aka Santikhiri)."

Transfer early in the morning to the Friendship Bridge. Here our guide will drop you off and bid you farewell. You’ll go through Thailand exit customs. Then board a local government operated shuttle across the bridge($1 per person is the current shuttle rate and this is not included in the tour rate as we cannot pay them). On the other side, go through Laos immigration(visa available on arrival – see visa section).
Upon exiting Laos immigration, our representative will greet you with a sign of SHOMPOO CRUISE in front of the Lao immigration office. Then transfer to the Houay Xay boat pier by tuk-tuk. Embark on the cruise down the Mekong. On the way, the boat will take its first stop at Pak Tha to have the boat documents signed. The second stop will be to visit a Tai Lue minority hill tribe village along the banks. Our guide will explain the way of living and the origins of these rural populations."

                Correct its a Libtard angle sympathy pro-immigration story with a subtle dig at Myanmar, and Thailand in particular for not giving these "Stateless People" citizenship. Reality is that they are simply economic migrants no more "Stateless" than a Mexican who flips over the boarder into the US.

             You are not credible and nobody is taking your word for it. Thailand constantly has false flag bombing events that are blamed on those the government wants to demonize. They lie about everything and a General seized power and elections haven't been allowed in years. The military and police are known to be trafficking drugs and have been accused of human trafficking. Thailand is beyond corrupt and your post is a laugher.

            This is probably something very simple which has got lost in translation and I'm driving myself mad for nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            When you search Worana Ratrawiphukkun on Facebook her name is the only result and by that I mean there are no results of people with the same or similar surname. Search full name - 1 result. Search surname - 1 result. What does Ratrawiphukkun mean and where did she get this name from?
           </p>
           <p>
            She has another name in brackets - Suwimol Comkeaw. Searching this surname brings up multiple results on Facebook. This seems like its her real name, or her birth name. I don't know how names work in Thai culture so I don't know why she'd have two different names.
           </p>
           <p>
            I searched Suwimol Comkeaw on LinkedIn. Her job experience reads - anything no tax at the best shop, Myanmar. She has one Interest, a leisure, travel &amp; tourism company called Isarakarn. Also, when you click on her job experience entry it also takes you to this Isarakarn company.
           </p>
           <p>
            Isarakarn is listed as a leisure, travel and tourism company with 1542 followers and 1513 employees on LinkedIn. This is obviously a big company. The website listed is a blogspot site which has actually been taken down. What's also odd about this company is that its employees are all listed as doing jobs completely unrelated to travel and tourism. A quick skim over the hundreds of people that have listed Isarakarn as an employer...
           </p>
           <p>
            Banker at Isarakarn. Professor at Isarakarn. Economist at Isarakarn. Engineer at Isarakarn. Low Fat(??) at Isarakarn. Importation at Isarakarn. Doctor at Isarakarn. And many many others. Is this a glitch with LinkedIn that they will connect any job you've done with any company you've listed as an employer or have all of these people actually entered these random job titles at this travel and tourism company?
           </p>
           <p>
            What does Ratrawiphukkun mean in English? What does Isarakarn mean in English? Why does Vernon Unsworth's girlfriends LinkedIn connect to a leisure, travel and tourism company under her own description of "anything no tax at the best shop"? Why is there no information online about Isarakarn that I can find, not even through Thai search engines? Why does Isarakarn with its 1500 employees have a half-hearted, cheap blogspot website which is no longer active and with WaybackMachine results only going to last year? Why are the employees of Isarakarn all listed with random job titles and descriptions that have nothing to do with leisure, travel and tourism?
           </p>
           <p>
            I expect there to be a logical answer for this but right now its doing my head in.

This I will certainly look in to tomorrow, thank you for adding, and just incase shit starts dissappearing could you please archive a few of those pages? I have a hunch you may have discovered something of importance.. As what you've said makes no sense atm.

            Thanks for continuing to cover this incident. My spidey senses were tingling about it from the get-go. I wonder if "wild boars" is code for something. Do the pedophiles hunt young boys in caves? I don't know, I hate to even suggest it, but I just wonder. Is it significant, or not, hat when Theresa May posed with the Thai cave rescuers she was wearing BRIGHT RED shoes:

             Typical red shoes. And that's a good point, well its not good but you know what I mean, about "Wild Boars" possibly being a code word. Because what do people do with wild boars? Hunt them... And another GOAT added that some of the boys come from villages that move around and have came from.across the border, therefore have no papers and are not citizens.. Perfect for these sickos.

            I also didn't realize that the cave was so close to the border with Myanmar (Burma), it is only a couple of miles away. Add that knowledge to the knowledge of how deep into the cave system they were (over 2 miles) and the fact that they were travelling in a westerly direction, which is towards that border, and it does indeed look a lot like they were being trafficked.

             Yea so we're meant to believe that they just went for a "quick" 3 mile stroll in to the caves after training? When I heard how deep they were I thought WTF are they doing that far in.. And now old Vern was supposed to be in there the next day, in a cave that possibly links to Myanmar?? This is no coincidence! Could we say that the "coach" was taking them to a certain point, possibly a camp, in the cave then Vern and Sawyer were to take them through to Myanmar where they would have been transported to fuck knows where?

               I don't get how the fuck they can just take these kids to a fucking monastery... Like did the parents have any say in this?? I'd LOVE to talk to the parents, if they even exist or are even alive! I have a friend who lives in Thailand, I might ask him what the word is over there about it.. And of course they went to one near Myanmar!

             "Vern Unsworth, a British caver mapping the cave, stated, "Nobody’s to blame, not the coach, not the boys. They were just very unlucky ... It wasn’t just the rain that day, the mountain is like a sponge and waters from earlier rain were raising the levels".
             <strong>
              Unsworth said that he himself had been planning to make a solo venture into the complex on 24 June
             </strong>
             , when he received a telephone call saying the boys were missing there."
            </em>
            - the boys entered the cave on 23 June. What a coincidence!

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             There was also what appeared to be a "rape tree" with straps made of strips of fire hose and nylon about 4 feet off the ground that appeared to be restraints. Trees with restraints, children’s clothing, a baby crib, a stroller, an outdoor bathroom, pornographic material, hair dye and a five feet tall underground cave that had a dresser and crates. The cave was not big enough for an adult, but a child could easily fit inside.

            Israeli diver warns effort to extract Thai boys from cave could end in disaster  6 July 2018, 9:45 am
           </p>
           <p>
            "An Israeli father-son team aiding in the effort to rescue a Thai soccer team trapped in a flooded cave are casting doubts over the viability of extracting the group through the water, saying it could end in a “catastrophe.”"
           </p>
           <p>
            "Rafael Aroush, who has lived in Thailand for decades, said the death underscored the difficulty that the boys, aged 11-16, and their 25-year-old coach, will face in trying to swim out of the cave."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Aroush on Thursday drove with his son Shlomi from his home in Udan Thani province to the Tham Luang Nang Non cave to help with the rescue effort, joining other Israelis also providing support at the site."
           </p>
           <p>
            "The complexity of the cave was underscored by the need for a special communications system, which an Israeli team from the firm Maxtech rushed out to set up earlier this week.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the system, a string of small devices, similar to handheld radios, pass wireless communications between each other, enabling a link in places regular radios won’t work, such as where there are major obstacles blocking the line-of-sight between the two ends of the line."

              He is a member of the Tai Lue minority, one of several groups whose people have over generations moved around the region, across open borders in remote hills between southern China, Myanmar and Laos, and into northern Thailand’s ethnic patchwork of communities.

              The radio set up sounds very suspicious. Was it already in place? If the caves were so dangerous for divers, and some were filled to the ceiling with water, were some of the radios under water? How did the divers get them in place so fast? Why didn't the US MSM highlight their work and heroics?  Was there a drug bust /trafficking operation going on? This is obviously NOT a case of a soccer team going for a stroll in a cave. In research for the original VOAT post on this topic, I discovered that the soccer team WERE NOT TAI CITIZENS. They were from a bordering region where they have NO CITIZENSHIP at all!  How convenient for a child trafficking target....

            Here is Sawyer on film talking about how he just happened to be in the exact city of Chiang Rai on his way to Bangkok when the cave rescue was going down.  That level of coincidence is not credible, in my view, especially since he himself expresses no amazement at the supposed synchronicity.

             Its very common and part of the culture to stay in a temple to make merit for a few weeks after a traumatic event. In this case they are thanking for their lives, to all who helped, and make merit for the death of the Thai Navy Seal. Honestly, if they didn't go into the temple for a few weeks after something like this it would look bad in a Buddhist culture.

             I think elon is part of the elite pizzagate abusers. He has a wicked need to change society drastically, that its probable that he dislikes humanity.  On joe rogans podcast he revealed subtly his dislike of humanity. Joe later jokes for Elon to not enslave and eat humans as our overlord. He keeps hinting that AI is going to enslave humans since we are cancer to society. I think deep down Elon thinks like the elite do. He's definitely a sketchy character.. mark zuckerberg like..

              Yeah and he doesn’t even drive a Tesla, he drives a vintage Jaguar that runs on gas and takes private jets. So much for the Green movement and “climate change”. Total hoax to enslave humanity even more. Do as I say not as I do. These people are fucked.

               John lennon beat his partners. Ghandi molested his niece. Einstein was a racist, abused his wife, and married a relative. They all are twisted people.

               Elon also said that he thought as a child he would get imprisoned in a mental institution because his brain was thinking all the time. He was 6.  I think he was hiding from us that he probably thought about hurting people or whatever dark thoughts.. He is the most impulsive man. He married the same women twice. Gambled all his money on space x. Another person that I followed his work is David Choe. David is the same level of impulsiveness, and he has said that he could of been a school shooter.  His art is super crazy..I think elon is a dark evil person like this and he needs to do these society changing projects because he deeply despises society. I think he probably is the type to engage in these satanic rituals in the least.

                Elon gambled nothing. It is a spook front supported by the endless money of the banking cartel. Tesla has hemorrhaged losses for over a decade yet the stock is through the roof because central banks around the world buy all their stocks.  This is fact, International bankers own Tesla, they own their stock.

             Hmm that is extremely odd.. I wonder if this was planned before the whole cave saga or was it just something that was "randomly" decided? Maybe they saw or heard things they shouldn't have so they were whisked away to a "monastery" to be "treated" aka memories erased and conditioning applied..

               Parents?  I never saw any parents in the media coverage.  I saw some adults who looked like they were told to stand and look related to the boys.

            there is this article that claims while in the cave the boys heard a roster, dogs barking and children playing. The article says this could be a shaft leading to the surface, but it could also be a camp further in the cave, possibly where the boys were heading.

               No idea but I think she was kidnapped and raped. Maybe her attacker is on the run or something. No idea but I wouldn't be too quick to condemn her for starting the fund page.

               Holy shit she just deleted her Go Fund Me. Her name is Aspen Sawyer. I found out by The Honey Bees twitter people posted how Craig is not to be trusted then someone posted his daughter Aspen Sawyers go fund me page and said Aspen blocked people who asked her questions about it and why she needed the money. This is not looking good...

                Craig Sawyer is Fake News or even worse.  He has connections with Tim Ballard of OUR  the Underground Railroad Group that we have researched and found to be compromised.

                The truth will out.  Demons always recall when they are confronted with the truth of Jesus Christ.  When His Children are in jeopardy He responds.  Just like the Cross works on the vampire and the devil.

            Wow. I just wrote something about the Wild Boars cave rescue a few seconds ago
            <a href="https://www.barnhardt.biz/2018/09/09/expanded-notes-from-argentinia-on-the-gustavo-vera-natacha-jaitt-tv-interview-on-vera-and-antipope-bergoglios-pedophile-ring/">
             in another post about Pope Francis
            </a>
            . An Argentinian prostitute working undercover has publicized her findings that Pope Francis' boyfriend is operating a pedophile network. Very interesting also is that she describes the Argentinian soccer teams as essentially pedophile operations:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Similarly, the soccer leagues in Argentina are essentially pedophilia + prostitution networks. The poorer boys are forced to perform sex acts in order to make the team (instead of normal try outs) and then they must continue to prostitute themselves in order to remain on the team. The handlers charge clients 200 pence for oral “sex”, and 1000 for anal (ew!). Many of these boys end up getting HIV. Boys as young as 12 years old are being forced into this.

              It's another big piece of the puzzle. Pizzagate is systemically established in our communities. Many organizations and institutions involved. Who knew? I sure didn't up until the Wikileaks emails.

               I don't know if Julian is still alive or now a clone, or what, but I thank him from the bottom of my heart for releasing those emails.  Wherever he is now, Thank You Julian.  Yes they have infiltrated everything.  You almost don't know where to start.  We have to stop following the YT Idols and out them all and stop falling for pols just because they are in our party (ha what party).  Trust no one at this point.  I am sorry to have to say that, but I have been burned too many times.

              Is it coincidence that the gay locker room  shit always seemed to revolve around guys who played hockey?  (I didn't share many locker rooms with soccer players).

               I think it is across all boards.  It goes on in all of the sports.  This is what I have heard from someone I know, heavily involved in sports.  He is gay and a wonderful person.  He believes in keeping his hands to himself.  An anomaly in both worlds.
