            You raise good points.  Not to mention that viewing that crap just excites them, leading to an increased probability that they will commit offenses on live, breathing children.

            The gist of the article:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Paedophiles who view indecent images should not be given any criminal sanction unless they pose a physical threat to children, according to Britain’s most senior child protection police officer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Simon Bailey said that the policing system had reached “saturation point” from increasing reports of sexual abuse, including online and historical cases. Lower-level offending should be decriminalised and dealt with through counselling and rehabilitation, said Mr Bailey, who takes the lead on child protection at the National Police Chiefs Council.
           </p>
           <p>
            He acknowledged that the stance would horrify many people but said that police forces had limited resources and needed to focus on .."
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the SAME GARBAGE that pedo apologists are arguing EN MASSE on other threads.  It appears that this sub has been INVADED by them.  They are downvoating posts that call for harsh penalties of offenders (including my own).

            If they come forward to expose the inner workings of the ring I will encourage mercy, but never sympathy.  It falls outside the bounds of all reason to show sympathy for a monster...however, if they are willing to begin, just begin, atoning for their crime but telling how they operated and all they know, I will encourage mercy in their sentences based upon the info they've provided.  Mercy.  But that is all.  Protecting children, even from their own parents sometimes, is the law's most noble endeavor.

            There are some intelligent comments here but ultimately the only thing that is going to happen is a reflection of mob mentality in society that is wholly not too healthy themselves. The powers that be know this about you, that EN MASSE you are an ignorant band of hypocrites and slobs. But the fact of the matter remains that WE LIVE IN AMERICA, where there are a set of principles that we must abide by to make things civil. WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE GOLDEN RULE. Yes, people have violated and in some matters worse than others. THIS IS NO DEFENSE FOR THEM, it is a PLEA FOR RATIONAL THOUGHT.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are some REAL idiots out there that do call and harass, make threats, and idiots like edgar welch that go and shoot off rifles, these are ALL horrible approaches to a very complex issue. ALL of us have to remember that SOCIETY IN GENERAL EN MASSE does not make good decisions, that's why all of us have to make a conscientious effort to remind each other that violence and threat are never the right answers. Regardless of what these people did or did not do they ALL deserve a fair shake at this thing and if it is ever proven that there is something wrong going on each and every one of them deserves full protection by the law, fair trial, pentinence, and ultimately forgiveness, depending on the echelon of their crimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            With that said, what seems astounding to me, is the veracity at which these people are able to push back at the so called 'harassment' that they are receiving. A THOUSAND CRIMES HAPPEN IN THIS COUNTRY EVERY MINUTE, what makes these people so special that they get the time to air out their grievances AND have SO MUCH DONE ABOUT IT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY?
           </p>
           <p>
            NO OTHER MECHANISM OF GOVERNMENT WORKS THAT FAST.
           </p>
           <p>
            That really tells me they have got something to hide and they are able to hide it quick.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember, you may not believe in Jesus, as I do not as the Bible tells us, but he DID allegedly say some good things.... You have to remember that each and every one of us was a pure vessel once, we were pure. It was this world that filled us full of misconceptions, distortions and lies and crystallized belief systems in you that may or may not be right or wrong, much of it is based on perspective and you do not know what kind of subjective experiences each and every one of us have gone through, so you just do not know. Combine that with the frankfurt model schools and the political and entertainment industry as one big mind conrol experiment our whole lives are one big illusion. It's time to wake up.

             To make another couple of points I know will be missed by the masses who portend to the christians or kind people they pretend to be:
            </p>
            <p>
             These people are counting on you betraying your better selves
            </p>
            <p>
             This 'en masse' kill them all attitude is only going to make them push back even harder because of the above statement and only force them underground faster.
            </p>
            <p>
             People that have been involved with the cult have done things to compromise each other and were born into it intergenerationally, and like us, were once pure vessels only to be filled with the filth that is still distorting their lives and everyone around them, wouldn't they want to receive some kind of forgiveness themselves?
            </p>
            <p>
             It is really time to examine yourselves to truly understand what side of the fence you are on, violence only begets violence. Now it the time to wake up...

            I remember that Who song called Rough Boys, I remember the line that says "I want to fuck and kiss you".
I remember the writer of that song saying several years after his child porn bust, that he was viewing CP to take down the banks.
If he said he was doing it to save the kids, I would believe him, because he's a British rock star, which is practically royalty over there.

            Thanks for your perspective.  By the way, is there ANY study that shows pedophiles can be reformed? I doubt it, and it smacks of the 'pray away the gay' stupidity that Liberals have been mocking and ridiculing, which makes this proposal even more ridiculous.

            I have no sympathy for pedos. If this is the case for advocates in the times office management and its various supporters let them offer their own children as a offering of good will to the pedos. Its like throwing raw meat to a pit of hungry wolves. Ugh

              I don't think that it is contradictory, pedophiles usually become what they are through abuse. It is out of their control. Because they are young - but at the same time, the only means of stopping it are pretty severe. Kill them or castrate them (which doesn't work for female pedophiles).
             </p>
             <p>
              So it isn't their fault they got there (satanic butt monkeys excluded), therefore I have sympathy, but there is no cure, so they must die upon discovery.

               And how about pedos who have never been abused? They are cunningly aware of everything they are doing.

            The average life span of an abused child used for child porn is 17 years old. Seems they KILL THEM when they become too 'adult' or begin speaking out against their abusers.

            F*ck the times. Watching kid porn is contributing to the problem. Someone's got to make the porn, which means children are continously being harmed. So yes, you should go to jail for watching porn too.

            Pedos want to be treated as gays and language used will be similiar to get liberal loving minority acceptance.   We have to vocally fight this even use doctored images to get the message across (similar to animal cruelty) to  ram home what we are being asked to tolerate and get the message out it is never OK, if prisons are too full - death penalty

            Conversely, on the front of Irish newspapers today, outrage over a case in which a woman with special needs was forced to remain with abusive foster parents for 20 years despite evidence of horrific physical and sexual abuse. Turns out the foster father was a large donor to one of the main political parties and got then Minister of Health (our current Minister for Finance) to intervene on his behalf
