<p>R KELLY is still earning royalties from a song he penned for Michael Jackson which is allegedly about a teenager he groomed and impregnated.</p>
<p>The shamed singer, 52, wrote You Are Not Alone for Jacko’s History album – which was the superstar’s first record following his 1993 child sex abuse scandal.
The ballad, which featured a naked Jackson hugging his new wife Lisa Marie Presley, was a massive number one hit for the Beat It singer which has been covered by other artists including Diana Ross.</p>
<p>But in the new docuseries Surviving R Kelly, the allegedly sinister truth behind the song has been revealed.
Lizzette Martinez was just 17 when she met Kelly at a Miami shopping mall in 1995.
According to the now 41-year-old, she was given the I Believe I can Fly songwriter’s phone number by one of his bodyguards.
\'GROOMED AND IMPREGNATED\'
Lizzette, who was a high school cheerleader and aspiring singer at the time, said Kelly promised to help her develop her music career.
She claims Kelly took her virginity at a drunken party, saying: “The first time I had sex with him there was a party going.
“Some of his crew gave me alcohol and I was drunk basically when we had sex.&quot;</p>

            Kelly and Jackson were magnets for their moguls.  Can you imagine the number of Children they procured for their directors, producers, etc?  The money from all the CP that was created as well?  Mind Boggling.

                Many years ago a group of Jewish businessmen infiltrated Walt Disney/Disney.  They had already started infiltrating other Studios as part of the Jewish Mafia and Bronfmans who are now in control of it all.  The Mafia is not only Italian there is a Jewish faction as well.  They no longer fight each other, for they have figured out they can become partners in crime.  Much more profitable.
