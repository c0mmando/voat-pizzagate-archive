            I didn't get a bad vibe from Aya at first, either, but then I remembered she grew up in the States went to George Mason University in Church Falls and Hillary pushing for her release and then I could imagine them doing just that, by being programmed. And then, the cherry on the cake, the illuminati/Mason 666 hand sign in their logo, convinced me even more.

            Look at the last paragragh in this 2014 article:
            <a href="https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2014/08/137246/egypt-miss-morocco-accused-in-a-child-pornography-and-human-trafficking-case/">

            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The US couple stated during the investigations that they had forced the children to have sex with each other in order to record them in a pornographic film production.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The charges WERE NOT mentioned in the US media reports. Those are heavy claims in the article, so how was this dismissed? Unsure what to think here.

            With Silsby, we had evidence of her (twice) trying to traffic kids over the Haitian border into DR. What evidence was there that this woman was being properly detained? Maybe she was a good one who was exposing things, which could explain Obama's non effort to help. I do not hold any position on this as I lack knowledge of the case, but please clarify the case against her (or the one supporting that they lacked evidence). Thanks.

            if anyone has anything like that on Trump it would have been all over a long time ago. Anything that comes out now never happens to have any evidence just hearsay. Lets say they are all pedos Trump can't tell on Hill and her crew cuz then he will go down...and if Clinton's cabal goes down then it all comes out cuz they won't go down alone. We also can't always believe anything in the media so this could even be someone having nothing to do with Trump but it's being blamed on him....either way we know they are afraid of him and want him gone and off Twitter too.

             Technically Haiti dropped the trafficking charges against Silsby, so...dropped charges doesn't mean innocent. I'm not saying she's guilty, either, just that that can't be the sole deciding factor here.

              The US State Department needs to do everything in its power to arrange for Aya and her husband to be released and allowed to return to the United States. It came to light that the children were beaten and forced to make false accusations on camera. A report showed no abuse to have transpired at the organization, and the families of the children have come forth defending Aya and her husband. Despite the evidence of their innocence, they are being held with no end in sight.

               I agree, I wasn't trying to make a statement as to this particular woman's innocence. I apologize if I wasn't clear on that. I was simply responding to the assertation that dropped charges = innocence, which we all know is not true, aka Laura Silsby. That's all :)

                 No problem. I'll refresh your memory. You said the molten metal in the basement of the WTC towers wasn't necessarily steel. I then made you aware of the fact NIST didn't find ANY evidence of ANY molten metal at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You need to explain why you so strongly believe the findings of a group EVEN YOU don't agree with.

                  did you not a get long reply that said NIST's job was to look into the cause of the collapse, not chase down every thing that occurred after the collapse. and they had conclusively ruled out a controlled demolition....and ended with 1500 pounds of thermite equal to 120 of dynamite in demolition work?  Thermite was used to on tower from the Chicacago's world's fair, they used 1,500 pounds on two columns and the fire was visible for two miles.

                   Finally regarding WHY thermite can't be eliminated, your red-gray chips found in the 9/11 dust were tested by the "bad" scientists. Their tests showed the infamous red-gray chips when ignited
                   <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/news/faqs.html">
                    burned at 430º C.
                   </a>
                   That's hot enough to create molten iron as a reaction product – characteristics that confirm they are thermitic material and not primer paint. Could they have been both? Hhhhmmmmm
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   You can't dismiss the molten metal the FDNY witnesses found. That molten metal has to be explained, you can't ignore it. You've tried to above by saying that much thermite couldn't possibly have been used because people would have seen it being trucked in and spread all over the TWC towers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   But as I've proven many times in the two years leading up to 9/11 there were numerous power-downs. Many floors were even shut down entirely for months after a tenant moved out. And finally all the WTC elevator shafts were all "repainted" with what today considering all the evidence really really really looks to have been a red-gray paint with Thermite mixed into it.

                    You know they actually could have done tests that said YES or NO this is thermite, right? A simple test would have been trying to ignite the in an inert environment that didn't contain oxygen. If they didn't ignite, definitely not thermite.  They didn't do that.   They promised in 2009 to do other tests that would actually prove if it was thermite or not.   They haven't done that.  In 8 years.  Not even the simple test I just mentioned.

                    And?   Do you know what temperature actual aluminum thermite reacts at in DSC test?
The spike starts at 650C, but that is not the thermitic reaction.  The thermitic reaction is at 850c.

                     for Christ's sake. But thank you for the idea, what a great way to hamstring an investigation. Use a theretofore unknown military type of incendiary and then brow beat anyone who says it exists. "Why you uneducated boob, no such incendiary with that chemical signature has ever existed!". 
Sigh....... AreWeSure there are easily 1001 different ways to create an incendiary. And bee tee dubs I strongly suggest you look into something called "circular reasoning" and its effect on an argument within a debate.

                   Evidently I have to break out the crayons again. Scientific Facts are NOT based on:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   1) how many scientists believe them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   2) where scientists went to school.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   3) the results of a scientist's other research.

                    You're scientifically illiterate.

                  <p>
                   Wouldn't it be sad if a scientist's current research could only be taken seriously if all his previous research was "correct"?.

                   "Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts. - Richard Feynman
address "What is Science?", presented at the fifteenth annual meeting of the National Science Teachers Association, in New York City (1966), published in The Physics Teacher, volume 7, issue 6 (1969), p. 313-320"

                   Finally regarding WHY thermite can't be eliminated, your red-gray chips found in the 9/11 dust were tested by the "bad" scientists. Their tests showed the infamous red-gray chips when ignited
                   <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/news/faqs.html">
                    burned at 430º C.
                   </a>
                   That's hot enough to create molten iron as a reaction product – characteristics that confirm they are thermitic material and not primer paint. Could they have been both? Hhhhmmmmm
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   You can't dismiss the molten metal the FDNY witnesses found. That molten metal has to be explained, you can't ignore it. You've tried to above by saying that much thermite couldn't possibly have been used because people would have seen it being trucked in and spread all over the TWC towers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   But as I've proven many times in the two years leading up to 9/11 there were numerous power-downs. Many floors were even shut down entirely for months after a tenant moved out. And finally all the WTC elevator shafts were all "repainted" with what today considering all the evidence really really really looks to have been a red-gray paint with Thermite mixed into it.

               Touché, however, neither were convicted of trafficking charges. That was the point I was trying to make. Silsby was guilty as sin, so I was just trying to say that just bc charges are dropped/lowered doesn't necessarily equal innocence. :)

              Egypt's new dictator might be worse than the old one.  He has been cracking down all human rights groups, NGOs, all civil society basically, any organization that might be a place people can organize and plan.   This has been going on for years.

              Egypt illegally held her for three years before her trial.  Even after the verdict was reached in February, they would not read the verdict and kept holding her.

               NGO´s are evil almost entirely.  They are fronts for the NWO.  Any sane leader of a country would destroy them in his territory if they truly were not a part of the evil.

            Maybe she agreed to become an informant in exchange for Trump negotiating release?  I'm still hopeful we don't have a pedo puppet in hiding :/

             Your response is rediculous. Maybe the Clintons got Silsby released for the same reason. He was also on Epsteins Island but that doesn't count either. Nothing counts for Trump fans. The guy is part of the club. Stop digging for far out excuses for why his identical actions are not the same.

              The Clintons immediately tried to get Silsby released, while Obama let this one sit there for two years.  Then miraculously Trump negotiates release within the first 100 days?  Most likely there is something here, but who knows wtf it is.  Could be good, could be bad, who knows.

               Because the establishment was freaking out at the possibility of Trump's election, doing all they could to torpedo him. They weren't treating him like one of their own. Anyone running a business with serious money in New York, DC, or LA rubs elbows over the years with some unsavory characters. That doesn't mean they're satanic pedophiles. Time will tell what Trump is.

                   The media thought he was a joke until it was too late. Dem's emails show they wanted Trump and Cruz promoted to drive voters away from "more reasonable" Republican candidates like Jeb and Rubio, who they thought would be harder to beat. The media was sure they could take Trump out if they could get him nominated the way they've often taken out candidates they don't like: blowing up their minor gaffes into major scandals and labeling them racist or sexists. In Trump's case, they thought they had a sure thing in their pockets with his "grab them by the pussy" tape. They didn't count on the voters seeing through the media playbook this time around and voting for him anyway.

               Because he did things that seemed he was on the side of the Angels.  The main thing for me was his speech at the NY City Catholic after the final debate speech with Hillary in the audience.  He said some real cryptic stuff about Hillary taking many villiages in Haiti.  It seemed that it could not mean anything but he was going to be different.  But either he is doing a deep sneaky type plan and will trick his enemies(after all he is way way smarter than people think.  His Uncle was given Teslaś notes after that scientist death to figure out what they all meant.  And his sister is a Federal Judge.) or he is dirty also just he was more cautious than the Clinton scum.

            I agree (From the other thread I added/asked):
           </p>
           <p>
            "The couple and their co-workers had been incarcerated since May 1, 2014, on child abuse and trafficking charges that were widely dismissed by human rights workers and U.S. officials as false. Virtually no evidence was ever presented against them..."
           </p>
           <p>
            Virtually? That means something was submitted as evidence. No mention of that WaPo? Are these C-ISIS-A ass-ets? Is this his anti-Silsby-narrative move a la "hey look, we all release overseas human traffickers"? Or maybe the opposite in that "hey these folks were innocent so we welcome them, but this Silsby character, I just don't know"?
           </p>
           <p>
            Hmmmmmm.....
