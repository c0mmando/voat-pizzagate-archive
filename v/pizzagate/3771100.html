<p>&quot;Paedophilic interest is natural and normal for human males. At least a sizeable minority of normal males would like to have sex with children … Normal males are aroused by children.” -Presentation at University of Cambridge 2014</p>
<p>This grossly fallacious statement &quot;was made not in private but as one of the central claims of an <strong>academic presentation</strong> delivered, at the invitation of the organizers, to many of the key experts in the field at a conference held by the University of Cambridge. Other presentations included “Liberating the paedophile: a discursive analysis,” and “Danger and difference: the stakes of hebephilia.” Hebephilia is the sexual preference for children in early puberty, typically 11 to 14-year-olds.&quot;</p>

<p>Two of the presenters were still active in society with no charges filed (at least one other presenter was convicted of child abuse afterwards---a member of Pedophile Information Exchange) as of late 2014: Philip Tromovitch, a professor at Doshisha University in Japan, and Ken Plummer, emeritus professor of sociology at Essex University, where he at the time had an office and taught courses. I haven\'t looked into if they are still teaching.</p>
<p>In one of the articles it was pointed out that the University in its charter provides speakers “freedom within the law to put forward controversial and unpopular opinions without placing themselves in jeopardy,&quot; yet would never have hosted a presentation discussing &quot;controversial or unpopular opinions&quot; such as Holocaust denying. It\'s doubtful that they would even host events such as demonstrating the lack of sufficient evidence for Darwinian Evolution or the complete absence of evidence for Dark Matter and Dark Energy, and yet they are hosting speakers promoting rape of children.</p>

             If that's true that means he doesn't view children or females as having inalienable rights to life and liberty, and furthermore wishes to justify his dark desires by implying that they are non-human (calling them "it") -- ironic given that it is still a sin to torment animals.
