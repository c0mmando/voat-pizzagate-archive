<p>Walt Disney\'s link to the FBI</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/06/movies/disney-link-to-the-fbi-and-hoover-is-disclosed.html">http://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/06/movies/disney-link-to-the-fbi-and-hoover-is-disclosed.html</a></p>
<p>&quot;From 1940 until his death in 1966, Walt Disney served as a secret informer for the Los Angeles office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to documents that have come to light under the Freedom of Information Act.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Eliot, who has written several books on popular culture, provided a copy of the Disney file to The New York Times so that information and direct quotations in the book could be verified against the Government documents.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In return for Disney\'s information, J. Edgar Hoover, the Director of the bureau, allowed Disney to film in F.B.I. headquarters in Washington. For his part, Disney allowed Hoover access to some Disney scripts, and made slight changes in a few lesser-known movies and an episode of &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; television show to mollify the director. There is no evidence that revisions were requested in any of Disney\'s classic animated features.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As a bureau contact, Disney reported on the activities of Hollywood actors, writers, producers, directors, technicians and union activists suspected of political subversion. The earliest communication between Disney and Hoover appears in a July 1936 memorandum in which Hoover writes, &quot;I am indeed pleased that we can be of service to you in affording you a means of absolute identity throughout your lifetime.&quot; The meaning of &quot;absolute identity&quot; is unclear, but the document signifies the beginning of a long-term relationship between the two men.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The F.B.I. and Disney found an opportunity for mutual benefit in Disneyland, which opened in 1955. A document in his file reads: &quot;Mr. Disney has recently established a business association with the American Broadcasting Company-Paramount Theaters Inc. for the production of a series of television shows, which for the most part are scheduled to be filmed at Disneyland, a multmillion-dollar amusement park being established under Mr. Disney\'s direction in the vicinity of Anaheim, Calif. Mr. Disney has volunteered representatives of this office complete access to the facilities of Disneyland for use in connection with official matters and for recreational purposes.&quot;</p>
<p>Knowing Disney is organizing events and meeting with government officials, one of their board of directors made a satanic tweet. His name is Jack Dorsey and he is also the current CEO of Twitter. He openly admits to being a satanist and is talking about Pasta here like John Podesta. People in the comments are woke.</p>

<p>&quot;Making the good pasta, reading through some amazing parts of the satanic verses; the (golden) threads begin to intertwine...&quot;</p>
<p>Disney along with Universal Studios and Sea World had a pedophile ring back in 2014.</p>

<p>Jon Heely, A Disney executive, got arrested for sexually abusing children back in December 2017.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2017/12/12/disney-exec-suspended-after-child-sex-abuse-charges-filed/944507001/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2017/12/12/disney-exec-suspended-after-child-sex-abuse-charges-filed/944507001/</a></p>
<p>Victor Salva, A Disney director got arrested for raping Nathan Forrest Winters in the 1980\'s</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8gv855/victor-salva-loves-terrorised-semi-naked-youths-jeepers-creepers-powder-clownhouse">https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8gv855/victor-salva-loves-terrorised-semi-naked-youths-jeepers-creepers-powder-clownhouse</a></p>
<p>He only served 18 months of his three year sentence.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/245090/clownhouse-molestation-survivor-nathan-forrest-winters-speaks-new-documentary/">http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/245090/clownhouse-molestation-survivor-nathan-forrest-winters-speaks-new-documentary/</a></p>
<p>Then got hired by Disney again in 1995 even after his conviction in 1988.</p>
<p><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-25/local/me-60848_1_child-molester">http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-25/local/me-60848_1_child-molester</a></p>
<p>So out of three years only serves half of it then gets hired again. Disney pulling alot of strings out in the court system.</p>
<p>CDAN entries on the rape of Fergie and Jennifer Love Hewitt on Kids Incorporated I spoke about here to. It was a Disney Channel show.</p>
