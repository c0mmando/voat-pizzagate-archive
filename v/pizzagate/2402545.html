            I’m not sure what to think about this one. More info about 9th circle, and who is writing about them is needed. Everyone and everything mentioned in this article seems real and pertinent, except the reference to the ninth crircle of hell cult. I’m certain all of these people are evil satanists, but the only time I’ve come across about the 9th circle was in the works of Kevin Arnett, suspected disinformation shill. We have wondered if it is his job to insert disingenuous research here in order to discredit. Be careful. It could be a well baited trap.

            Jimmy Savile is alleged to have been a member of the Ninth Circle e.g.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhLfotgl6A4">
             this video
            </a>
            He was well-known for child abuse of course, but was also accused of murder and necrophilia. Not sure about the occult stuff. In the famous Louis Theroux documentary, Savile does this odd thing when he goes around to Theroux's house. Savile left the house by walking backwards, telling Theroux this was to give the impression that he was entering. I remember thinking it was just a contrived eccentricity but I wonder now if it didn't have an occult meaning.

            I got so frustrated with people trying to defend her back in the CPP days, saying that she was "just an artist man" and "you just don't understand performance art," even though the cunt herself says that when her "art" is performed on a personal scale at-home, it is "religious and ritualistic in nature," but when it is performed in a public space, then its "art." All of these people need to be thrown into vats of hot oil.

             Artist here.. you can tell the art she does is dark. Most refer to her from the documentary she did on Netflix which shows her in a much different light than her actual art. I knew nothing of the Sprit cooking but now that i see it. yuk. But as one who is around the elite art world but not in it... and never have wanted to be. there is dark energy there and its real. I have never been to the NY or Cali scene, and knowing what i know now, thanks to pizzagate, i never want to be in those elitist circles. I never really did. but they won't let you in unless you are somehow born into it or are brought in.

              Any fine arts courses the days, the student has to study this witch's work.  Most of the students think it's cool (I'm talking neo feminist millenial students).

              Not only is the art "of a dark nature," but these elitists also use art galleries to launder money and make backroom deals to buy/sell children. We're pretty certain that's what James Alefantis' "Transformer Gallery" is used for. Speaking of JA, do you ever hear his name mentioned in art circles? And if so, in what context?

               I believe that. I can't say I've seen it but I believe it. Lets just say many of the trust fund people i do know are really messed up people who try to mingle in the normie world but can't relate to us but they are missing something in their life, you can just feel it. Any artists who come from the elite world are the ones who "make it" in that world, but they are all very messed up mental individuals.

                That would be because anyone who "makes it" only does so because they agreed to sell out to the Brotherhood of Freemasonry, and from that point, they begin going through the rituals, which is guaranteed to fuck up anyone's mind. So that's why all "artists" have this air of being not completely present at any given moment, like they're always spaced out. That's from the electroshock. Think about how messed up it would be to have a life where all you do is get electroshocked, and then you're forced to make works of art, which is the only way you can sort of tell people what's happening to you, and then they use your art as a front to launder money and buy/sell child sex slaves. No wonder artists all seem depressed.

             No problem! I thought it was worth posting as I haven't made any threads yet since being a member. I believe the comment was left on January 10, 2018. If you go to the video posted, you can do a key word search for it. Just hit Ctrl F and it will bring up a search window in the upper right hand corner. It lets you search through comments. The persons YT handle is mydogpets I believe. Let me know if you found it!
