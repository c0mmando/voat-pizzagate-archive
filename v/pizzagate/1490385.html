            Just thought, they might be trying to stop us collating a list of anti pizzagate bot accounts.... probably because they don't want the masses thinking that they use bot armies cuz that's a tactic they want us to think only the ruskies use.

            I actually started using Twitter's banning algorithm to verify evidence in the end! If you put up something that's safe for the Pedo's nothing happens,,, post the Alefantis instagram pic with the Chickelover comment and bam your out. Evidence validated lol
           </p>
           <p>
            on a side note, after an argument with some poor illinformed person [I won't say liberal cuz i'm not american and to me fighting elite pedo network isn't a partisan issue] they  tried to claim the comment was because the both loved chicken,,, i know right. But I'm curious for a view from any parents,,, that child looked too young to be snacking on KFC. Am I wrong??

              haha,, no.

             <p>
              Actually,, interestingly enough I noticed these bots a few day's AFTER my lively debate with what was clearly a real person. She made the comment about maybe they just liked Chicken and I responded with 'yeah or maybe it's this' and linked to the slang dictionary link highlighting it as a pedo term.
             </p>
             <p>
              The next day when I tried to post the pic I got banned. Then a day or two after that I started seeing these bots.
             </p>
             <p>
              I wonder if you can post that pic now,,, seeing as they've figured out a rebuttal.  Would try myself but fk Twitter. If I could get some solid feedback on if that child was actually old enough to chomp a chicken thigh I'd feel like I had a solid response to what is clearly a bollocks argument.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's just nonsensical,,, what in that picture would inspire a PIZZERIA owner to comment about their love of chicken?? For me that pic is killer evidence. When I first saw it on his insta account before he went private I didn't think it was dodgy, just some guy and his kid but then of course I didn't spot the comment and even when I did I wasn't clued up on the lingo enough to get it, I just thought that's fkin weird... but once you know what you're looking at that pic/comment is VILE!!

            Did you only just do that search? Because when I do it it's only coming up with 2 from the same user "bearspeaktruth", one on the 8th and one on the 10th of Dec. Strange that's all that's showing, what's up with that you think?

             Not sure yet, I'm on Twitter since a few weeks only. More answers would be better, but I suppose that it reinforces the idea that Twitter changed something in their advanced search settings between yesterday and today, at least for the pizzagate bots.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've tried many other sentences, if that's what you're asking. Always the same results, only tweets from this particular bot today. Yesterday it was working just fine with any sentence, but it was late so I only made one screenshot and was planning to save everything today.
            </p>
            <p>
             Non-exhaustive list of lines that the bots are spamming:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              pedophiles DO have symbols but they use the EXACT same symbol as the FBI website shows bc it's SIMILAR to so many logos etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              pizzagate fact check: being abnormal or weird isn't illegal. Ask Ozzy Osbourne how he spent his career
             </p>
             <p>
              People create fake news about things like #pizzagate for the Google Adsense revenue they get on both websites and Youtube
             </p>
             <p>
              a triangle in a logo doesn't mean the fucking logo is pedophile but an EXACT replica of a PEDO symbol is indeed a pedo symbol #pizzagate
             </p>
             <p>
              pizzagate ignores the fact that there are no lists of missing or found children
             </p>
             <p>
              Milo from Breitbart says that #pizzagate is real but he?s bathed in blood and he thinks 14 year olds doing oral on adults is A-OK
             </p>
             <p>
              Trump eats pizza all the fucking time for hours straight and hes friends with Jeff Epstein. #Pizzagate
             </p>
             <p>
              MichaelFlynn promoted the #pizzagate lie because he thinks making Hillary mad is more important that preventing mass casualties

              Pizzagate : heavy metal isn't illegal and the metal lifestyle may be creepy but it's just not illegal. Ask Ozzy Osbourne

              that comet ping pong logo is two ping pong paddles not the pedo logo are all these generic logos from a clipart site pedo too? #pizzagate
             </p>
             <p>
              pizzagate shows how sick some people are that they think every cute photo of a baby or inside joke is pedophilia
             </p>
             <p>
              Sometime I pity Milo from Breibart because he gave a talk about being statuatory raped when he was a young teen
             </p>

              Comet Pizza is a pizza parlor where the #altright and 4chan tried to get people killed for their amusement
             </p>
             <p>
              I dreamed the FBI cared about Comet Ping Pong
             </p>
             <p>
              pizzagate shows how far conservatives will go even to the point of killing their perceived enemies
             </p>
             <p>
              one of the paintings the #altright uses to push #pizzagate conspiracy theory was done by an outspoken child abuse survivor
             </p>
             <p>
              if your friend believes in #pizzagate maybe you should call his mom or the FBI he's unstable
             </p>
             <p>
              People think it's funny to make fake maps and graphics and laugh at you. Basically 4chan is just trolling all gullibles #pizzagate
             </p>
             <p>
              4Chan is confusing for those of us with organized thought processes
             </p>
             <p>
              pizzagate ignores that Bill Clinton and Donald Trump were on the same Epstein flights
             </p>
             <p>
              Why do all #pizzagate people know so many pedophile "code words" and symbols - and why did they expect Comet people to know them, too?
             </p>
             <p>
              If your mom knew how obsessed you are with #pizzagate, she would cry and beg you to get a job
             </p>
             <p>
              Gay is not pedophile
             </p>
             <p>
              pizzagate could very likely lead to a mass casualty even but #Bowser and her police chief pretend that it's child's play
             </p>
             <p>
              pizzagate shows they hysteria of lonely people in numbers
             </p>
             <p>
              none of the #pizzagate people seem to care that the next shooter will likely kill kids playing ping pong &amp; eating pizza
             </p>
             <p>
              pizzagate thinks a lot more about child sex than anyone I've ever heard of
             </p>
             <p>
              pizzagate: MOST people don't know pedo keywords have to look them up, just like YOU DID so why assume Comet customers know them?
             </p>
             <p>
              Pizzagate is illogical and relies on people who are obsessed with pedophilia and know how the pedophile networks word. Why?
             </p>
             <p>
              first they came for the artists and #pizzagate is simply a way for nazis on 4chan to trick people into mass violence and casualties
             </p>
             <p>
              The guys in #pizzagate are actually still asking their parents to give them video games for Christmas
             </p>
             <p>
              Milo from Breitbart doesnt think 14 year old kids with 30 year olds is pedophilia #pizzagate
             </p>
             <p>
              anyone who leaves a review of Comet Ping Pong is subject to crazy people sending them fucked up messages online #pizzagate
             </p>
             <p>
              Russians really hacked our government and nobody cares
             </p>
             <p>
              It's very likely the 202 area code people who told #milo from #breitbart to stop "reporting" on #Pizzagate were lawyers or #SteveBannon
             </p>
             <p>
              Milo stopped "reporting" on #Pizzagate because there were kids there when a gunman arrived

              Yeah I tried a few of those phrases and got nothing. I guess that means they're watching this and fixing their shit accordingly? I don't know.
