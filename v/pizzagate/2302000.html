<p>Well, in <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2017/12/todays-blind-items-instagram-terror-web.html">CDAN\'s</a> <em>third installment</em> in this crazy ride the saga takes off at 1000 miles an hour toward our favorite destination in <em>this</em> saga, <strong><em>Pizzagate</em></strong>, and our favorite occult city, <strong><em>Washington DC</em></strong>, coupled with a few unbelievable stops along the way to be introduced to the crazy fucked-up &quot;luxury and excess&quot; of the rich and famous.

<p>Recently I wrote about this escort that seems to be in the middle of everything going on in the long running widows scandal. It turns out this escort is even more involved than previously known. When we last saw the escort, she was saving SB and sealing the tragic fate of RJ (Chester Bennington) and PJ (Chris Cornell) at the hands of the A+ lister.</p>
<p>Why were SB (James Franco) and the A+ lister (DG) so close? At some point back in time, SB and a family member hooked up with the A+ lister. He helped them and they helped him. <strong>SB is close to a director</strong>, an A list indie type director not named Bryan Singer. Think darker and more gritty films. He is someone who has always taken deep dives into underage sex and using that as his rationalization, has sex with underage teens constantly. Ask his current significant other actress how old she was when they started hooking up. She was very much underage, and helped him find underage teens for his &quot;projects.&quot;</p>
<p>Apparently <strong>the escort and our money/fame hungry widow were involved with this group</strong>. Right now, it isn\'t known if they were part of the director\'s crowd, but suddenly they were there.</p>
<p>Here is where it gets a little more complicated. Our A+ lister had met some men from overseas who were interested in young men. They also were interested in young females. The young men were to be play things for rich men overseas. The young females though were a different story. <strong>Some of them were sent to Dubai to be sexually used and abused for a year or two before they either made it back home or ended up beneath one of the many construction projects.</strong></p>
<p>There were another group of women that have met a different fate. Most were <strong>Instagram models</strong>. Men overseas would go on the internet and choose one they wanted. They would then be quoted a fee of between $2500-9500 <strong>to a business located in Washington D.C</strong>. That business specialized in selling items that were all priced in that range. The crazy thing is though, <strong>if you took a look at the business, they didn\'t actually have any inventory.</strong> They were just funneling money for a bunch of different purposes. <strong>One of those purposes was providing Instagram models as wives to some very very bad people who had been promised wives if they signed up to fight.</strong></p>
<p>Most of these Instagram models that were picked at random had no interest in going overseas even for sex. However, <strong>there were plenty that the escort found through her web of other escort friends and models she would talk to online</strong>. How to make sure the models were really interested? <strong>SB would make a personal plea or his almost equally famous family member.</strong> The models would be told easy money was waiting overseas. The models all thought they were going to Dubai. They would start in Dubai but were then transported to other places not as nice and then married off. The people getting the wives were not going to complain about not getting their first choice or try to demand a refund. <strong>These models were then paraded and used as a recruitment tool to get more people to sign up to fight.</strong></p>
<p>Now, it isn\'t clear whether SB or the A+ lister or even the escort or our hated widow knew the full story of these models. I do know they knew the women were being sold/rented to men in Dubai. I know <strong>they took a cut of that big fee paid to that mystery business</strong>. I know the escort <strong>is still trolling for new women online to sell</strong>. I don\'t know who her new middleman is, but <strong>she is still doing it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Salena Diana Jenkins</strong> ladies and gentlemen, we\'ve ALL probably heard about her folks, she\'s the Person Of Interest in the infamous <strong>&quot;Robert Downey Jr.&quot;</strong> blind:</p>
<p><strong>Is Secret Celebrity Tea dropper Actually Robert Downey Jr.</strong></p>

<p><em>&quot;I am a FORMER personal &quot;friend&quot; of a woman named Diana Jenkins. Doubt you know her, but she\'s the Rosetta Stone of every scandal and perversion from Hwood all over the globe. She\'s an Uber-wealthy divorcee whose hubby ran UK\'s Barclay\'s bank - and she ran the Arab investors for the bank! She\'s been running a high class call girl/party-girl ring for Arabs, Wall Street, DC, Royals, and Hollywood elites. She\'s also a MAJOR philanthropist, arts supporter, political donor, and social hostess to EVERYONE. Her best Hwood pals include Sean Penn, Clive Davis, Ari Emanuel, George Clooney, Cindy Crawford, and her &quot;little pet&quot; named Hayden. Diana is the connector of wealthy Arabs and Asians and Athletes with Hwood actresses/models. She also is a sick and twisted bitch.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Here she is with many of her pals, <strong>and believe me, she knows everybody, this woman opens up doors to tons of possibilities</strong>:</p>

<p>-There were another group of women that have met a different fate. Most were <strong>Instagram models</strong>. Men overseas would go on the internet and choose one they wanted. They would then be quoted a fee of between $2500-9500 <strong>to a business located in Washington D.C</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>if you took a look at the business, they didn\'t actually have any inventory.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Now, ALL OF US here by now understands that &quot;art&quot; can be &quot;inventory&quot; and &quot;it is not&quot;. Its a commodity that can be traded for outrageous amounts, aid human trafficking by laundering money among many other possibilities.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1855938">Art in Embassies Program Gave Podestas, Jeff Koons, Rockefellers, Clintons, Marina Abramovic, Rothschilds even Alefantis access to a private shipping channel that could bypass airport security </a></p>
<p><strong>So who is the firm, pizza shop, etc, that handled it all?</strong></p>

          <p>
           Recently I wrote about this escort that seems to be in the middle of everything going on in the long running widows scandal. It turns out this escort is even more involved than previously known. When we last saw the escort, she was saving SB and sealing the tragic fate of RJ (Chester Bennington) and PJ (Chris Cornell) at the hands of the A+ lister.
          </p>
          <p>
           Why were SB (James Franco) and the A+ lister (DG) so close? At some point back in time, SB and a family member hooked up with the A+ lister. He helped them and they helped him.
           <strong>
            SB is close to a director
           </strong>
           , an A list indie type director not named Bryan Singer. Think darker and more gritty films. He is someone who has always taken deep dives into underage sex and using that as his rationalization, has sex with underage teens constantly. Ask his current significant other actress how old she was when they started hooking up. She was very much underage, and helped him find underage teens for his "projects."
          </p>
          <p>
           Apparently
           <strong>
            the escort and our money/fame hungry widow were involved with this group
           </strong>
           . Right now, it isn't known if they were part of the director's crowd, but suddenly they were there.
          </p>
          <p>
           Here is where it gets a little more complicated. Our A+ lister had met some men from overseas who were interested in young men. They also were interested in young females. The young men were to be play things for rich men overseas. The young females though were a different story.
           <strong>
            Some of them were sent to Dubai to be sexually used and abused for a year or two before they either made it back home or ended up beneath one of the many construction projects.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           There were another group of women that have met a different fate. Most were
           <strong>
            Instagram models
           </strong>
           . Men overseas would go on the internet and choose one they wanted. They would then be quoted a fee of between $2500-9500
           <strong>
            to a business located in Washington D.C
           </strong>
           . That business specialized in selling items that were all priced in that range. The crazy thing is though,
           <strong>
            if you took a look at the business, they didn't actually have any inventory.
           </strong>
           They were just funneling money for a bunch of different purposes.
           <strong>
            One of those purposes was providing Instagram models as wives to some very very bad people who had been promised wives if they signed up to fight.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Most of these Instagram models that were picked at random had no interest in going overseas even for sex. However,
           <strong>
            there were plenty that the escort found through her web of other escort friends and models she would talk to online
           </strong>
           . How to make sure the models were really interested?
           <strong>
            SB would make a personal plea or his almost equally famous family member.
           </strong>
           The models would be told easy money was waiting overseas. The models all thought they were going to Dubai. They would start in Dubai but were then transported to other places not as nice and then married off. The people getting the wives were not going to complain about not getting their first choice or try to demand a refund.
           <strong>
            These models were then paraded and used as a recruitment tool to get more people to sign up to fight.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Now, it isn't clear whether SB or the A+ lister or even the escort or our hated widow knew the full story of these models. I do know they knew the women were being sold/rented to men in Dubai. I know
           <strong>
            they took a cut of that big fee paid to that mystery business

            "I am a FORMER personal "friend" of a woman named Diana Jenkins. Doubt you know her, but she's the Rosetta Stone of every scandal and perversion from Hwood all over the globe. She's an Uber-wealthy divorcee whose hubby ran UK's Barclay's bank - and she ran the Arab investors for the bank! She's been running a high class call girl/party-girl ring for Arabs, Wall Street, DC, Royals, and Hollywood elites. She's also a MAJOR philanthropist, arts supporter, political donor, and social hostess to EVERYONE. Her best Hwood pals include Sean Penn, Clive Davis, Ari Emanuel, George Clooney, Cindy Crawford, and her "little pet" named Hayden. Diana is the connector of wealthy Arabs and Asians and Athletes with Hwood actresses/models. She also is a sick and twisted bitch."

           -There were another group of women that have met a different fate. Most were
           <strong>
            Instagram models
           </strong>
           . Men overseas would go on the internet and choose one they wanted. They would then be quoted a fee of between $2500-9500
           <strong>
            to a business located in Washington D.C
           </strong>
           .
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            <strong>
             if you took a look at the business, they didn't actually have any inventory.
            </strong>
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Now, ALL OF US here by now understands that "art" can be "inventory" and "it is not". Its a commodity that can be traded for outrageous amounts, aid human trafficking by laundering money among many other possibilities.

            Personal life[edit]
           </p>
           <p>
            Korine was born in Bolinas, California and raised in Nashville, Tennessee, to a Jewish family. He is the son of Eve and Sol Korine.[3] His father was a tapdancer and produced documentaries for PBS in the 1970s about an "array of colorful Southern characters"; he would take Korine to carnivals and circuses[4] and taught him how to use a Bolex camera.[5] As a child, Korine watched movies with his father, who rented Buster Keaton films and took him to see Even Dwarfs Started Small (1970) in the theater. Korine reminisces, "I knew there was a poetry in cinema that I had never seen before that was so powerful."[6][7] As a child, Korine changed his name from "Harmony" and went by "Harmful," as he thought it made him sound tougher when he got in fights.[8] Korine spent his childhood in Nashville, attending Hillsboro High School before moving to New York City to live with his grandmother.[1] Korine also spent some time living with his parents in a commune, which helped to inspire the commune setting of Mister Lonely.[9] As a teenager, Korine frequented revival theaters, watching classic films by John Cassavetes, Werner Herzog, Jean-Luc Godard, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, and Alan Clarke. In an interview with Bruce LaBruce, Korine briefly mentioned that he studied Business Administration in college. Other sources[who?] state that he studied Dramatic Writing at Tisch School of the Arts at New York University for one semester before dropping out to pursue a career as a professional skateboarder.
           </p>
           <p>
            Korine met Chloë Sevigny in Washington Square Park in New York City during her senior year of high school in 1993.[10][11] The two became close friends, which resulted in her being cast in the low-budget independent film Kids (1995).[12][13] They had a relationship that ended in the early 2000s. He is now married to actress Rachel (Simon) Korine, with whom he has one child, Lefty Bell Korine.

           <p>
            Rita Ackermann is a Hungarian-born artist who moved to NYC in the 1990s. The early paintings that made her famous, including Should I call the Ambulance? (1994) above, featured overtly sexual “cyberpunk, cat-eyed nymphs,” and are rude, gritty and other-worldly all at the same time. With so many themes, it’s easy to see why the Whitney Bienniale literature called her an aesthetic “magpie.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Fans of Ackermann’s art often link the pieces back to the grungy streets of New York City right after the tech bubble burst in the beginning of the 1990s. At this time, Ackermann had just immigrated to the city. The vividness of her scenes belies a sense of culture shock she must have been experiencing at the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            In an interesting side note, Ackermann seems to espouse a sexually overt and grungy self-image much like the paintings she creates. Here are some excerpts from an interview in which Ackermann offers short, frank responses that hark back to her art in both form and content:
           </p>
           <p>
            AM: What do you find most sexy?
RA: My underwear
           </p>
           <p>
            AM: What is your favorite walk?
RA: Down dirt roads
           </p>
           <p>
            AM: Where do you live?
RA: Chinatown in New York (Author’s note: doesn’t get much grungier than that…)
           </p>
           <p>
            While I like her use of colors, I just can’t get myself to love her work. I wonder if Ackermann’s success relies less on aesthetics and more on her ability to capture the zeitgeist of a NYC moment? If she had focused on the culture of a less artsy city – Chicago for example – would she be as respected? I guess only time will tell.

            Career[edit]
Ackermann has been featured in numerous museum and gallery exhibitions in the United States, Japan and Europe.[4][5][6][7]
           </p>
           <p>
            Since the mid-1990s Ackermann has been adding to her knowledge of painting and her social comment. "from stained glass to the red ballpoint pen she’s applied to runway models’ faces in lieu of makeup. She has realized multiform shadow puppet theaters like The Deer Slayer (1997), performed as a band member of the art collaborative Angelblood, and curated exhibitions including The Perfect Man (2007) and The Kate Moss Show (2006, with Olivier Zahm)." [1]
           </p>
           <p>
            "In both her drawings and collages Ackermann juxtaposes characters and narratives, as in Scorpionun (Man on My Breast/Man, Man between My Legs) (2006), which draws on the semiotics of fertility charms and pornography to create an Anthropomorphism like womanman- child. The superimposed images composing this life-size freestanding collage on plexiglass come from the artist’s own sketches—a row of her lithe women, wearing bowler hats and holding tennis rackets — as well as other sources, such as an illustration of the Madonna and Child positioned over the figure’s heart. As Scorpionun’s content suggests, Ackermann’s interest in constructions of gender and the fantasies that subtend and are sustained by them has survived her transformation of scale and material. Indeed, the oversize cruciform Nun/Skeleton/Cross (2006) and comparably large-scale Nun/Mother/Whore (2006) revolve around the bifurcated, simultaneously present identities of these objects of desire. The aggregation in these collages’ listlike titles is mirrored in the conspicuous overlay of their images: Ackermann does not negate tropes of womanhood but stages them as acts and processes of becoming to be set into dizzying and conflicting relief with and within one another. Few clear plots emerge despite her utilizations of fairy-tale themes, and irrespective of the ingratiatingly beautiful protagonists who inhabit them, neither are there storybook endings." [1]

            Her work includes paintings, drawings, T-shirts,
            <strong>
             a line of underwear
            </strong>
            , and skateboard design.[7] Her paintings in the early and mid 1990s featured
            <strong>
             nymphetish girls.

            Don't forget Hillary as Secretary of State followed her husband's lead when POTUS. Create severe economic turmoil in a country with Soros' expertise and repeated experience.

            Recruit pharmaceutical companies to do mass drug testing, as there will be many unemployed of all ages desperate for extra cash. Victims will not have the resources to sue if they get seriously ill and die as a result of the medical tests. Courts would be beyond bogged down anyway. Lawyers and judges are generally the 1st to leave an suddenly financially unstable country.
           </p>
           <p>
            Introduction of illegal recreational and partydrugs to speed up the process of working people's destruction will then flourish, at a profit to favored traffickers, when there's sudden, massive economic despair. So will guns and weapons for protection against roving gangs of violent criminals.
           </p>
           <p>
            Snap up the resulting orphans abandoned to care homes, and the babies of mothers now incapable of supporting themselves. Many desperate women will now be turning to prostitution creating a new supply of aborted babies for sale. All of the above can be used in the organ trade, or if pleasing enough, international sales of flesh.
           </p>
           <p>
            Modern art sales to the countries remaining elite/leaders in power, or promises of film deals to document the end of their authority and their ongoing bravery, or music deals creating songs to temporarily calm the working classes, will buy silence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Countries needlessly torn apart and devoured for the benefit of a few in the above manner now include those battling Putin for hegemony control and the members of the former USSR and satellite countries. Note what's been happening in the Ukraine since Soros involvement. Also that a major Hollywood star is now married to the lawyer that backed/defended one party in the fracas.

            This is probably too off topic here but as  an aside, in the movie Snowden, there is a scene where Snowden asks another CIA guy about how the pizza is here (upon arriving at his new job in Hawaii).

            Why were SB (James Franco) and the A+ lister (DG) so close? At some point back in time, SB and a family member hooked up with the A+ lister. He helped them and they helped him.
            <strong>
             SB is close to a director
            </strong>
            , an A list indie type director not named Bryan Singer. Think darker and more gritty films. He is someone who has always taken deep dives into underage sex and using that as his rationalization, has sex with underage teens constantly. Ask his current significant other actress how old she was when they started hooking up. She was very much underage, and helped him find underage teens for his "projects."
