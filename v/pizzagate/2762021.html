<p>Relevance: Well, for better or worse, QAnon has become a centerpiece in the debunked conspiracy theory we call pizzagate. One of his posts included a pic of strange code including &quot;elvi&quot;. The instructions went on to say to use &quot;elvis&quot; if &quot;elvi&quot; wasn\'t working. This submission will focus on what this might mean. Why? Because secret letters from Elvis Presley are being published and, allegedly, they contain information including that he was kidnapped and tortured in September 1968, and that he was physically and psychologically abused for years. This discovery is also relevant because we know Elvis was attracted to underage girls, but did you know his friends were Tom Jones, Marlon Brando, and Harry Belafonte, Jr.? I didn\'t, but the first two are also accused of being pedos. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tom Jones was accused of raping an underage girl: 
<a href="http://www.americatalks.com/news/police-investigating-sir-tom-jones-over-child-rape-allegations/">http://www.americatalks.com/news/police-investigating-sir-tom-jones-over-child-rape-allegations/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and Marlon Brando had a Voat thread devoted to his pedo insanity. The thread explained that Brando was friends with Michael Jackson, and had a daughter Cheyenne that committed suicide. Cheyenne accused her father of rape.</p>

<p>These friendships may come into play because letters from Jones, Brando, and Belafonte were also found in the cache and the ones that were written by Brando confirm just about everything speculated in the Voat thread and more. </p>

<p>Okay, so this was just dumped in my lap and I decided to post this submission and let people make up their own minds. </p>
<p>My opinion is that Q is a LARP, but this ... this .... there would be no way of knowing that this would come to light. Not unless he was very well-connected to PedoWood elites. I suppose he or she might be like entylawyer. If <a href="https://voat.co/s/he">s/he</a> were, he might have heard this was taking place. But the tidbits are intriguing. One was that Elvis was kidnapped and tortured in 1968. It hints at these dark secrets being the reason for the multiple suicide attempts and drugs. </p>
<p>If true, it would mean this cabal of satanists were operational when Elvis was king, but they would have to be. This type of control can\'t be had overnight. But about the letters, here is the official website of where the author is promoting his book: </p>

<p>I listened to it and was stunned by the Brando revelations. Brando was certifiably crazy. He thought he &quot;channeled&quot; the spirit of Elvis\' dead girlfriend Jeni and exhibited MULTIPLE PERSONALITY DISORDER. Yeah, that grabbed me. And I\'m wondering if this dead girlfriend was what they used to get to Elvis? I\'ll have to read up on what happened to her. </p>
<p>Harry Belafonte is the unknown. I never heard anything negative about him, and maybe there isn\'t. I don\'t want to make unsupported allegations and so I\'m sticking to the two that did have charges made. And just to tie this to Q, here\'s the tweet where I made the connection: </p>

<p>I\'ll try to do some searches later. Just wanted to get this posted. It could be disinfo, but it might not.

            this post is not properly sourced either but I see that you have not deleted it. Still breaking our posting rules for your own personal preferences. This post is on par with a Sarah post. Somebody posted this just to make it "appear" pizzagate related to push the Qanon topic. "I was skeptical of Q but this post made me believe." This post is shit.

            Physical and psychological abuse is not pizzagate related. Where does this post source back to Elvis being sexually molested as a child? It does not. This is some sort of bait post to sell a book or something.

             You know, I have to wonder why all the good investigators are gone and a POS like you is still here? Does anyone else have that same question? It might account for this forum being a ghost town.

             Kidnapping and physical abuse is pizzagate. There have been many discussions about PedoWood stars undergoing ritual abuse/physical abuse and torture to keep them in line and live out sick games.

             As for the Voat thread, obviously, the Tom Jones link was posted twice. Here's the post I found on Brando:

            </p>
            <p>
             As for you, shill. I'm blocking you. If there are any more ridiculous problems, they'll have to be passed along. But again, why are you still here and coddled by the mods? Do the mods not see that only 60 people are responding to good threads when the numbers used to be in the hundreds? And the views in the thousands? Why do you think that is? Because they capitulate to scum like you.

              Each post must stand or fail on its own merit. Your post does not fit the rules. I try to keep this sub pure and fre from unrelated pizzagate Qanon trash clutter. You failed. Deal with it.

Trump can talk directly to people's cell phones. So what? How is that pizzagate related. I"m waiting..........and waiting........

            , I am not seeing anywhere where Q mentioned either Elvis or this Linux code Elvi thing. That tweet is from July 2, but there's nothing in the Q drops related to this from around that time that I could find. I'm going to have to flair this and ask you to edit per Rule 2. Thanks.

               This one was posted in April and the other was in July. I'm not a follower of Q so don't know what precipitated these, but they were posted. Perhaps two random people guessed at something. But the first is not random. That account follows everything Q does and is a believer.

               Whatever. Do what you want. I notice you don't give shit to shills which is generous of you. That's why this forum is dying. You gave me a hard time for liking a bot when you protect shills? Makes no sense. No sense at all. And ritual abuse and mind control is part of pizzagate and that's what this sounds like. I mean, who the hell kidnaps a star as big as Elvis Presley and gets away with it? The Pedo Elite, but you're right. This has nothing to do with anything. Carry on deleting.

               <p>
                I ask you to edit this post to provide links supporting your unsubstantiated claim that Q mentioned Elvis, instead of deleting it for Rules 1, 2 and 3, and I am the corrupt asshole protecting shills? WTF?
               </p>
               <p>
                What I am noticing here is that you made this rule-breaking Q post at the same time

                made his post about the EBS. Esoteric shows up in both threads expecting me to not do my due diligence on both posts, harping about "Muh...biased pro-Q mods not enforcing rules". He shot his wad prematurely, though, because I had already flaired this thread for breaking the rules.
               </p>
               <p>
                Then, you get all defensive when I ask for the supporting links for major claims this research post required for submission and tell me to "Do what you want" and "Carry on deleting."
               </p>
               <p>
                You don't answer my question about how you happened to stumble across obscure tweets from months ago.
               </p>
               <p>
                You then admit "I'm not a follower of Q so don't know what precipitated these," coincidentally the same excuse Esoteric gave back in March

                 You're proving my point.
                </p>
                <p>
                 All I did was see something interesting. That was the new book that will allegedly be publishing letters written by Elvis. They are alleged to show he underwent years of psychological and physical torture. His letters were stored with letters written by Tom Jones, Marlon Brando, and Harry Belafonte. Tom Jones and Brando I knew were accused of being pedos, and Elvis also dated young girls. I wanted to see what came up on a search because I didn't have much time last night, and boom! There's a post by a twitter account that I know is a huge Q follower. I thought it was pretty goddamned interesting, especially when  looked into the strange penchant Elvis had for the aforementioned young girls, and found ties to the Process Church. So I had psychological torture, pedophilia, the Process Church, kidnapping, a tie-in with Michael Jackson because Brando was a bff of his and because Elvis and Sammy Davis, Jr used to hang out with MJ way back when the Jackson Five were playing Vegas. Oh, and let me throw in satanism because Sammy Davis wrote a book about his involvement with it. And you don't understand why I wanted to post this? And are calling this ''bait''? That's pretty funny. Very funny. I can't imagine why I thought the above subjects wee included under the pizzagate umbrella because obviously they have nothing to do with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And I'm not claiming the mods are corrupt, you are corrupt. If a POS like Esoteric shade gets passes all these years and really good investigators get shit and hassled for the trouble of posting, then yeah, I can say the mods are corrupt. And you don't think this forum is dying? Look at the number of up and down voats. Even on popular threads the numbers are ridiculously low. Yes, you did manage to keep a couple of solid investigative posters, but other than that? The only members you've kept at shills and disnfo specialists.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And, no, I'm not going to go through all the trouble of digging up evidence and expanding on the OP. Why would I? So sixty-two people can read it? It's pathetic. So you can give me shit? You're blasting me for not complaining and then you come back and blast me for doing the opposite. And I love the use of the words ''talking point'. It can't be that the identical situation applied in both cases so we both logically gave the same reason. And there is no such thing as plagiarising reasons. If you couldn't get to school on Monday because you had a cold, it doesn't mean that someone else could miss school for the same reason. But then you go further. I posted because I'm a shill and I'm here taking up time and space for God knows what reason. Look at my threads and conversations. Look at my upvoating. Do you really think I'm a shill? Really? Or are you giving another a LARP performance?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Like I said, do what you like. I believe I'm entitled to my own opinion and my opinion is that the forum has gone downhill. I liked Millenial Falcon way better than this. The forum was jumping, the posts creative and well-researched, and there was lots of traffic to get info. But Voat has what it has and I should state that at least it's still standing.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And as for that last question, I could easily see myself being a sockpuppet, but I would never be a sockpuppet for ESOTERICbullshit. Never.

                 <p>
                  I agree that Brando, Elvis and the rest should be investigated. But you made a categorical statement right at the beginning of your thread:
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   One of his posts included a pic of strange code including "elvi". The instructions went on to say to use "elvis" if "elvi" wasn't working. This submission will focus on what this might mean.
                  </p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p>
                  The link you provided did not show the Q post that would support this claim, and when I went to look for it independently to give you the link to add to your post, I could find no mentions of Elvis by Q whatsoever. Then, instead of simply modifying the Q reference to acknowledge that it's a mystery why these twitter handles associated that stuff with Q, you pretty much told me to fuck off and that you wouldn't edit your post.

                    Your behavior makes no sense.

                   In retrospect, I should have only posted about the book and then added on additional speculation as speculation. Like I said, I came across the book, did a quick search and found that tweet and figured I post the Big Magilla. The personal knowledge of that tweeter being a big Q supporter tipped me in that direction.

                   Maybe I'll try again because this really is important. I underestimated the polarization mentioning Q would unleash. Honestly, it never even occurred to me. I don't believe in Q, but many do and there was that tweet. But the Brando, MJ, pedo, Process Church tie-in are there. And I disagree that my behavior makes no sense. I just wanted to get the info out and had intended to amplify on it.

                     Only one of us has been correct so far and its not you, bro. I have been feeling sorry for you guys for almost a year when your tribunals and mass arrests didn't happen. I will be feeling sorry for a year from, and the year after, and every year after......So far you have been wrong and you will remain so, forever or until you see the light.
