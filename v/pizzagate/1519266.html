<p>I couldn\'t find Jimmy\'s Monologue in video but if anyone else watched the episode aired on NBC tonight you\'d have seen both Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers discuss in complete acceptance, the validity of the Stratfor leaks in relation to HIllary Clinton, John Podesta, Edgar Mitchell and others.  This is the same exact batch containing all of the incriminating communications.</p>
<p>Joe Biden discusses victimization, power, his family.  His wife comes on and discusses their travels around the world with different institutions...  
</p>
<p>This comes after about a half hour of trump jokes and rhetoric predicting Hillary as President.</p>
<p>NBC is running specific episodes with content related to Pizzagate.  I watched these reruns purely to see if I would see anything related.  And the day after Christmas on Monday what do I get?  Perfectly handpicked propaganda that would deflect Pizzagate and discuss certain aspects of the same e-mail leaks nonchalantly. </p>
<p>At one point Seth Meyers almost eerily glorifies Joe Biden.  The cheers are too much haha honestly.</p>
<p>At one point Jimmy makes a joke about Edgar Mitchell\'s e-mails.  Sorry I don\'t have the clip.

<p>The same entities that are deflecting the reality of Pizzagate and lobbying to aggressively remove any evidence of their corruption, calling it Fake News are openly giving validity to the same sources who verified the Podesta e-mails.  I can\'t believe this is still considered an investigation to be honest.</p>',
