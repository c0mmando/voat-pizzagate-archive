However, though it may seem safe to us because we\'re sitting at our desks looking at computer screens or walking around while surfing on our phones, what we\'re doing is real. </p>
<p>The people we\'re investigating are real.</p>
<p>Their horrific crimes against innocent people are real.</p>
<p>And none of this is a game to them. They murder people. If they\'re discovered, they face long prison terms (and we know how popular child rapists are in prison), the death sentence, and termination by their own people for putting them at risk.</p>
<p>When one of us gets too close to them, one more murder is nothing to them because they already have too much to lose. Perspective: they steal children, rape them, kill them, eat them. Taking you out is nothing by comparison because they have no moral compass.</p>
<p>I\'m not saying we\'re all in danger of being murdered, but we are all in danger of being harassed in one way or another even if &quot;only&quot; getting our computers and emails hacked, and possibly much worse. </p>
<p>Another thing, these beings feed on fear, in some cases, quite literally. So try not to fear-- take precautions instead. By using multiple layers of protection you will know you\'ve done everything possible to protect yourself so that you can focus on helping the victims and saving the children. </p>
<p>This is an incomplete list and I hope others will comment about what works for them.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Safety Precautions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maintain situational awareness at all times. If you take a bus, train, or drive a car anywhere, notice who is around you. Make it a game to take the stress out of it. Did that guy sit across from me yesterday too? Did that woman just take the same two bus routes that I did? Is the guy with the two kids walking behind me following me, or is he just not walking as fast because the kids are slow? What happens if I turn around and walk past them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have flood lights or outside lights where you live, use them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invest in surveillance cameras for your home or property. You can get a set of four from Amazon for around $100. If you use wi-fi to set them up, maximize the security settings or have a techy geek friend do that for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carry something in your hand for protection while you\'re walking: keys, flashlight, etc. Use it if you are physically attacked and by all means, don\'t hold back because they\'re not going to either.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always let someone know where you\'re going and when you should be back, and tell them what they should do or who they should call if you don\'t meet your schedule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In your home, laws vary by state in the US when it comes to home protection. It also varies by country. You can protect yourself and still follow your local laws. I strongly recommend that even if you live in a place where it\'s legal to protect yourself and your home with deadly force that you do not even think about having a gun unless you\'re trained to use it and will not hesitate to use it. I say this because the bad guy won\'t hesitate to take it away from you and shoot you. All it takes is a half-step backward from you or a moment of hesitation for this to happen. And no, I\'m not anti-gun and I\'ll just leave it at that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Computer/Internet Safety</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Handwritten notes are always best because nobody can hack them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you\'ve collected what you think is sensitive information that might put you at risk, create a deadman\'s switch of some kind. You don\'t have to get fancy as in PGP encryption unless you\'re technically capable of doing that. Instead, you can save your info to inexpensive USB sticks and mail them to various friends around the country. Ask them to put the USB stick somewhere safe and if something happens to you they should share it with the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Periodically save your notes to an external hard drive, DVD, CD, USB stick, or whatever and take it offline and keep it somewhere safe. (Read up on making a cheap Faraday Cage if you\'d like to preserve it in case of an EMP attack.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a VPN. Lots of paid services out there. Look for one that is based outside the US though nowhere is a guaranteed safe zone from the NSA. If you\'re on Windows, this is one free option: <a href="http://www.vpngate.net/en/download.aspx">http://www.vpngate.net/en/download.aspx</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use an encryted but free email account like protonmail which you can sign up for at protonmail.com. Again, hoping others make suggestions as I\'ve heard mixed things about protonmail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a browser such as Epic Privacy Browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not use the same &quot;handle&quot; or name for various accounts such as Voat, Reddit, emails, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change your passwords often. I know, it\'s a pain in the ass. Do it anyway.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Several others have posted on this in the Pizzagate sub in the past, but I\'m not finding most of their posts. I did find some good suggestions on this thread: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1502298">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1502298</a></p>',

            I have a problem hiding.  I have never been any gokd at that.  I feel like there is safety in numbers.  If you are sharing potentially dangerous info, have a plan.  I have a friend that I can count on to make something go all over the internet and most people with a Anonymous mask are good at that.  I put something everywhere and e mail my " exhibits" to random attorneys I know.   The fact of the matter is that I am not difficult to fimd.  They know where I am.  I have been an activist on social media for a while now and have drawn the ire of various random people.  I am already used to the threatening profile pictured trolls who will like something just to have you see some crazy image of a gun pointed at me.  That is about the stupidest way to try and scare someone because I've never heard of anybody dying violently at the hands of a maniac with a photo of a gun.  I had one stalker that used to take pictures from the same vantage point as me.  I would post these sunset photos in a local group and he would have almost the identical one.  So I asked him where he livee because he must live close.  He answered " I don't live there but I have sat outside your home thousands of times" and someone had been sitting outside in a black Miata.  Weirdo.  This pizzagate stuff is a whole new level for me.  I heard a thin steel mesh like for chicke coops can be used to line your walls to defend against EMPs.  I just happen to live right below where they did this

            I am not even kidding! They did this Dec 16, 2016 and it would have been nice to have steel mesh.  There was so much weird stuff happening that day and I am grateful to the FB friend in the UK who must be in the know because he dug this up for me.  I do not mean to sound like a conspiracy nut, but if you ever have a chemtrailed "X" right above your houses, I would go visit a friend all day the next day.  That is how they mark the exact spot for these experiments in warfare.  I am close to a military base so I have observed some interesting stuff.  I have heard other people say they had the planes put an X over their street too.  I honestly have no idea if this is really a way to target people.  If so, it doesn't work that well.   Other than hearing noises all over and having what feels like these huge super wind turbines blowing at the roof and windows, there was no real harm done.  I could not remember anything the whole day.  Probably the aluminum particulate but I was not permanently harmed.  My daughter was sensitive to whatever they were doing though.  She kept waking up screaming and I just about took her to the hospital over it.  So small kids should not be home if you get EMP'd.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is safety in numbers.  Always remember.  It's sometimes also good to talk about yourself in the third person and let it be known that this information is already out there.    So rather than " I was looking into this and came upon this and only sharing it in one place( like here) , you can say, " I saw something in my news feed and researched further and found an interesting connection which the FBI is aware of."  LOL.  If it's big and very serious, make FBI aware.  There is a special division that spans several countries that watches the internet stuff.  Not NSA. They are FBI but they are their own group and those are very good people who protect your identity and seem to get results very swiftly.  I trust them even though I have never met them.  If you ever have something you don't want to put everywhere because it could put the voctims in harm's way , leave these guys mentioned here a comment with your link

            And they get it done.  They're two for two as far as I can tell reading the news .  Not the same FBI as that one guy Trump fired.  He did host them ar a meeting but these guys do not rat people out to the White House and I am certain of that.

             That reminds of what it says in Revelations 9 that locusts will be sent from the Abyss to torment people for 5 months.
Their sting is like a scorpions sting.

            Also:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Never use the same password twice for any accounts, and make sure those passwords aren't remotely similar to any password you use in real life.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) NEVER offer anything remotely personally identifying.  I see things here that someone with access to certain databases could use to dox.  Keep your location to a major metro area if relevant.  That's it.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) Do not store any of your notes in the cloud.  I would surmise that Dropbox, OneDrive, etc. are all backdoored at this point.  Want to know what someone posted here on Voat?  Take a 20 word "clip" and drop it into the backdoor crawler and see whose account is associated with what amounts to a unique ID.
           </p>
           <p>
            4) Be careful of what you may cross-post between this world and your life.  Some here have the luxury of going balls out on every form of social media.  Some of us do not.  For those who cannot, this is serious business.
           </p>
           <p>
            Good post OP.

            With all due respect to the OP but if these people want to fuck with you they're gonna fuck with you. There's not much you can do besides buy guns. That's why they did Sandy Hook. Millions of Deplorable Shit Lords with assault rifles scare the shit out of them. Had Killery won one of the first things she'd have done is take down the 2nd Amendment by executive order for that very reason.
           </p>
           <p>
            If there's one thing the Deplorable Horde Army needs to do right now it's pray these demonic ass clowns don't start WWIII in Syria in response to

              The sloth of May will look for some "payback" on June 1st. That's what the Cicada reverse audio said 2 or 3 months ago.

            As someone that has been targeted for over 21 years, take it from me, there really is no place to hide if you are putting information out there. Mail can be intercepted and almost all online activities can be tracked, if they decide to do so. My advice, pray. Accept Christ and have faith. If Christianity ain't your bag then at least have some belief in a higher power. I know, it sounds like a 12 step program but in a way, all those principles apply

             I'll be totally honest, my computer seems to have come under attack earlier today, and my repose after shutting it down, was to call two friends and have them pray. I believe that's why things came back to normal with my computer within an hour. This is a spiritual war. Even computers can be blessed ;)

             You should become facebook friends with (or maybe just PM her) Judyth Vary Baker. You could tell her that one of her friends sent you. Can't tell you my name though. Lot of people there in her group that have been through the same thing. Have you ever read "Girl On The Stairs"? No need to answer.

             How did you come to the realization or actually decide that you were/are a Targeted Individual? Weird shit has happened to me and I really feel I might be one.. I'm really curious of your experiences. Please let me know. I'm new to Voat so I don't know if there's a way to PM me, but if there is you are welcome to.

              I would not worry too much about it.  The thing is that it is much more conspicuous for them to kill some Pedogate investigator than it is for them to just stick to that fake news narrative. I do not bother hiding.  I stand behind what I say.  When I get it wrong, I say so.  I know that I should probably have six fake profiles to rotate in between, but that just is not my style.  Seth Rich probably would have been better off posting everything he had in all kinds of FB groups before giving it to Wikileaks and using a different name. Because then everyone would know he's that guy and he would have a protective local unofficial network of friends and followers that volunteer their services.
              <br/>
              You asked for a description of weird shit that happens.  Paperwork constantly goes missing never to be found again.  Image disappear from FB and entire apps disappear from my phone( the whole g mail app disappeared for  a two-week period.  I suspect it may be election fraud related because of the e mails from Headcount which were gone when the app came back.  Glad I made screen shots ahead of time. Let's see, there was a drone experiment done above my home.  I think the targeted area was the whole block not me. It's a good location for Naval warfare exercises I suppose.  All the time people temporarily change their profile pictures to some evil looking picture and like my comments so I see threats in my notifications.  Don't be afraid of any idiots that think they can intimidate you with a picture.  Just replyl :
" Oh no call 911 this guy is trying to kill me with a picture of a gun" and they go away.  Usually it won't let you reply to them.  If some psycho came to my door making threats ( which has also happened.  Random homeless people that don't really look homeless but are trying to.  Happened three times)then it is time to buy a gun or even a spear fishing tool which fits in the pocket and never misfires.  You can easily rip someone's eyes and nostrils out with one swipe with a spear fishing end and I paid !2 at the Swap Meet!  I have had tires repeatedly slashed in the last two cars.  Potato stuck into my tailpipe but I noticed it before I even got into the car.  I found out who did that one and I got even in a legal and creative way.  I have bought new locks three times but the inside part of my lock ends up the same no matter what.  I gave up on new locks.  Somebody obviously wants this particular one that sticks and is a pain to lock.  Whatever. A really weird one is that t shirts appear that belong to nobody and they are folded like brand new.  Fire Dept shirt, and two Sherriffs Dept shirts.  I have asked all around and it will remaim a mystery.   I have thrown the Fire Dept one out twice and twice it has returned.  That one creeps me out the most.  I had my former apartment building burn down and just prior to that, I kept finding toy firetrucks and paramedic figurines in my closet.  Some were my son's toys but some were not even ours.  And he did not play in my closet ever.  He had all his toys in the other room and it always seemed to happen when we all left.  I suppose perhaps a friendly ghost was trying to warn us.  Haha.  I say that because it ws a well plotted out event and included brand new fire extinguishers being put on every entry way just a week before amd batteries removed from every smoke detector.  I had a hunch about it and told the guy upstairs ( because his place got badly damaged from fire that spread to him) to make site a battery was in his smoke detector so his renters insurance would cover it.  So he had to put one in and none of ours were in either.  When landlord heard alarm going off she even said" Why is a smoke detector going off?"  Scandalous.

              A lot of other weird stuff too but I could maybe explain other incidents like missing shoes and items by blaming my kids or chalk it up to early dementia.

               Have you considered doing some counter-intelligence? As in, carefully placed video cameras located where you could catch them in the act? I'd avoid wi-fi models because they can sweep for them. I've been amazed by the quality of video and sound offered by the cheap video cameras that are disguised as car remotes that are dirt cheap. You can buy them from Amazon. Ask a friend to order you a few. I attached one to my dog's collar and like I said, I couldn't believe how good they were.

                I have caught them in the act already.  The first day I lived here aomeone broke in and I have come home and found someone on the balcony.  He was a relative though.  That's why I kind of just blow it off.

             Fear has a purpose, and that purpose is to keep you breathing. The trick is to know what is worthy of your fear and what isn't. Security always involves making compromises with convenience, just remember to act so that the risk/reward ratio is in always your favour.

              Fear is a heavy low vibration.  While using fear to 'keep you breathing' as you said, sure, the fear can motivate you but by the nature of it's vibration it can also attract to yourself the very thing you fear.
             </p>
             <p>
              On the other hand being focused from a point of logical critical thinking, a much higher vibration, one can take precautions from a point of clarity/not fear.  I admire the Aikido approach to fear~

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Aikido means “way of combining forces." Unlike other martial arts, which rely on force, Aikido is all about joining with your opponent’s energy. This is called “blending."
              </p>
              <p>
               When someone throws a punch at you, or grabs your collar, your first instinct is probably to tense up or back away. In Aikido, you learn to do the opposite. You “blend” with the attack by relaxing your entire body and moving right next to your opponent.
              </p>
              <p>
               We need to learn to do the same with fear.
              </p>
              <p>
               When we blend with our fear, we take away its power.
              </p>

              .  It's good to have a space here and there to discuss the fears that come up bc I don't think any of us are immune.

               Sure. Responding to a threat effectively involves understanding the nature of the threat; threats are not always due to the malevolence of adversaries. Sometime a threat arises because of our own ignorance of the nature of a potential adversary, a false assumption regarding someone else's intent or about the forces driving a particular situation. There's a certain duality regarding fear: a state of mind that could manifest either with a peaceful outcome or with an evil outcome. Being drawn to it is part of the process of resolving the duality, either finding a balance of forces or engaging in some form or crisis or conflict.

            Somehow my computer and email are functioning fine now, but there was an attempted hack a few hours ago with things happening that have never happened before. So yeah, no amount of protection is too much. We are dealing with the CIA and they have infiltrated our group successfully, IMO.

             Do not worry about it that much.  This happened to me daily.  I had reconfigured my last phone so the font changed whenever someone was spying.  I had to unhack it all the time.  It is most likely because of key words that are automatic flags.  We are researching pedophiles and that brings up a lot of target words.  But almost any word is a target word
  Target is a target word.  So is wind, blizzard, earthquake, device, defense, climate, plane, train, package, power line, energy, Japan, and lame stuff like that.

              All I know, and I'm very much a novice when it comes to computers, is that suddenly my computer no longer responded to my mouse, except I could refresh the page. No other commands worked. Minutes after that began,  a screen popped up that was from Google saying they've frozen my email due to suspicious activity. This was the first for either of these to happen. Someone got into my gmail account and sent out a bunch of messages or something (Google gave 3 options that could have been the reason my account was frozen, all of them sounded pretty bad, and was clearly not anything I had done.) From what I can tell, everything's normal now.
