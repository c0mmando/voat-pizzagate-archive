            Sorry but the so called wild fires have to do with agenda 21 and energy directed weapoms, not PG. They are burning down the same coridor that the put aside for agenda 21 land. There is a video showing it is the exact same borders. They then all but forcing people to sell and FEMA buys up the land. They did this in Texas as well.

             If you think that... You think trump is a bad guy. You think The deepstate is fighting to survive.... If trump is the bad guy, What are you doing? This is the last place you should be, if you think that. Because we're fucked.... You think we're fucked...Yet you choose to spend your time convincing everyone else that we're fucked.... ANd you do so based on nothing, And in spite of contradicting evidence.

Because what you're saying, Implies trump is bad... If trump is bad, we have no chance... Lol. It makes no sense why you're here.  Do you think any of us are going to make a difference if Trump and everyone With him are actually just the same as the rest... Can't you at least see the absurdity of you spending your time on voat?

             Perhaps it's that California is known for wildfires.
            </p>
            <p>
             A several year drought has left a lot fuel for fires.   When the Santa Ana winds are blowing any small fire came become a firestorm.  The embers are blown by the winds and start new fires.   There's no way to predict where the embers will go.  I know someone who fights wildfires in CA and they are no joke.   Oakland had a massive firestorm in the early 1990s, that started from a small fire that put out the day before.  The winds picked up and a spot that was still hot was now flooded with oxygen and within minutes a hillside was on fire and the first hour 700 structures were burned.

              These aren't wildfires. The fires are skipping the forrest and brush and burning down neighborhoods, simultaneously at different spots, all in land that was selected for agenda 21 coridors. As usual, you are here as the resident snopes shill. You live here for what other reason?

               The Thomas Ventura fire has burned 200,000 acres.

                It's the vegetation that's fueling the fire.

                HOW DID IT BECOME A MONSTER?
It was wind, but also a landscape filled with fuel
So how did the Thomas fire become such a monster? Heavy winds are one factor. But another is the thick brush that has not burned in decades, providing fuel.
“The fuels in there are thick and they're dead, so they're very receptive to fire,” said Steve Swindle, spokesman for the Ventura County Fire Department.
The fuel can spread the fire even when winds die down.
“Since it’s so dry out there, it doesn’t take much in the way of winds to create those critical fire weather conditions,” said Robbie Munroe, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. “We’ll see wind gusts in that ... area between 20 and 35 mph, maybe a few mountain sites might see up to about 40, but that’s the most we’re expecting right now.”

               The fire has now entered the Los Padres National Forest.

              <p>
               It started as a brush fire in the hills and canyons near the Steckel Park campgrounds.  This is from the first day.

               High winds catch embers and drop them where the will.  I believe the fault may be in the natural gas lines.  The San Bruno fire in 2010 was known to be caused by a natural gas pipeline explosion.  It also had burned houses, with trees not burned.  It had cars with tires and hubcaps melted.  I took 90 mins for PG&amp;E to turn off the gas lines.  Given their record of poor maintenance and cost cutting I expect that natural gas is feeding the house fires and the wind is feeding the flames and movement of embers.

              Well, after reading CDAN many mentioned both.  Neverland was my first choice but some mentioned both and I saw a pic of MJ with Spielberg at Skywalker.  Don't know who posted it on here this weekend.

When It's Not the gas Line, It's The entire City block that was burned when the fire started Jumping roads And concrete parking lots... Just because you know, why not, its 2016.

             We toss around Terms like,
             <em>
              "the deep state" Shadow Government, "Global elite Pedophile and trafficking rings"
             </em>

            </p>
            <p>
             My Point is..How many Comet Ping Pongs Do you think are in each of our Major Cities? Forget all the areas in which entire Towns are implicated and hidden through out the world/country. But Just the major cities...
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not going to give my real prediction, because I won't be taken seriously.

              But I will say without a shadow of doubt, There's at least 100. There are at least 100 Establishments within a mile or so radius within each of the  largest cities in the world, That are involved in the exact Same Global Conspiracy as James Alefantis And Comet Ping Pong

            <p>
             Admittedly I hate using him as an example, Because I mean, James Alefantis Is most Certainly An outlier when it comes to the standard Person involved with this shit....
            </p>
            <p>
             . Like, we think we know. But it's hard to Comprehend, Let alone visualization the amounts of resources  required to run a global trafficking ring As well as all your black op/off the book operations.

              But what we're witnessing now, Is about as close as most of us will ever get to being able to actually visualize the amount of resources it takes to run a Global Crime Syndicate...This Is all destruction of evidence/ providing a cover.

            </p>
            <p>
             . what we're seelng Is what happens When the deep state Has to run and Hide, Or who the fuck knows. Maybe the white hats are just burning it all to the ground... Maybe they Figured that was literally the best option, and it literally might be.

              Or of course there's the third possibility. We're just a fucking simulation.... And when you've lived your life Not knowing the actual scope of the deep state situation, Until you watch it burn before your eyes... It doesn't make sense.  LIke, What's more crazy.... We're living a simulation.... Or the Deep state Exists... Personally, I don't truly believe we're in a simulation... But it's no more crazy than the real shit that's be unfolding for too long.

              Implausable. They control the justice system and aren't under investigation so why would they need to destroy evidence? This is agenda 21 weather wars, just like the 16 so called HAARP hurricanes manufactured couple months ago.

               And bro... You say Implausible... And then you say what you said. Lol. Don't you see how fucking silly you're being.  Everything I said Is extremely plausible based on the facts of the matter. But there's litearlly nothing to base your "Opinion" on...OTHER THAN, "It was fucked in the past.... So it's always going to be fucked".... Even though again, The facts of the matter suggest Nothing is the same today, as it was before trump was elected.

               Are you insinuating trump is the same as the rest?  If so, there's nothing I can say To change your mind.  Because at this point in time, if you think trump is the bad guy, you're not basing that opinion on anything tangible...
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm not saying you're wrong... I'm just saying I'm not going to waste your time, or Mine, If you base your opinions on... Well whatever is you base them on.
              </p>
              <p>
               But I will say, If Trump is a good guy... Then your comment isn't really relevant. you know? Because yes... The Justice system Was controlled.... Just like our Government was controlled, including the presidency....I
              </p>
              <p>
               *If you think The system is the same now, as it was with every president before trump. Then your comment Makes perfect sense. I don't say that sarcastically. But based on the only available evidence... I don't think trump is the same... So no, the justice system Isn't the same. Nothing is the same. Your Comment is assuming it is the same, and that's just the way it is going to be.

                Assuming Trump is a good guy, The Deep state Is Not waging wars to fulfill weather agendas. They are fighting to survive. Assuming trump is a good guy... you can't just be Pessimistic because, "That's how it's been in the past" I truly believe that you're wrong about every aspect of what you just said.  But guess we'll see... Lets hope I'm right though, Right?

It's quite a ways from where the fire is and it's EXTREMELY unlikely that the fire will reach it because it would have to take out pretty much all of Santa Barbara and Goleta. Not gonna happen. There was a fire in June of 2016 that sort of kind of was near there but not this one.

             agreed and you're correct about Goleta.

              I have no doubt the fire is intentional, and their goal is multi-fold. But I don't think the distraction is specifically about Neverland. They could create a distraction anywhere on the planet for that. Btw, I didn't downvote your post. It's just that your headline made it sound like the fire was barking up Neverland's driveway and I wanted to paint a more accurate picture.

               I didn't make it sound like that at all. And I don't really need your upvoats or downvoats! I have plenty and am not here for that.
