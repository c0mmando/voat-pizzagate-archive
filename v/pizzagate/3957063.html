            It's the same story with Serbia. Globalist action caused the country to be destabilized (I believe Bush was involved), causing strife, death, and REFUGEES; for  at least the past decade.

            They get what they want in crisis, and get to pretend by the good guys. The result is always the same : missing children, war, poverty - so they seem like the saviors when their orphan agencies, their troops, and their banks can come "HELP" (themselves).

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Twenty years ago, President Bill Clinton commenced bombing Serbia in the name of human rights, justice, and ethnic tolerance. Approximately 1,500 Serb civilians were killed by NATO bombing in one of the biggest sham morality plays of the modern era. As British professor Philip Hammond recently noted, the 78-day bombing campaign “was not a purely military operation: NATO also destroyed what it called ‘dual-use’ targets, such as factories, city bridges, and even the main television building in downtown Belgrade, in an attempt to terrorise the country into surrender.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Clinton’s unprovoked attack on Serbia, intended to help ethnic Albanians seize control of Kosovo, set a precedent for “humanitarian” warring that was invoked by supporters of George W. Bush’s unprovoked attack on Iraq, Barack Obama’s bombing of Libya, and Donald Trump’s bombing of Syria.

             Dr. Sue Arrigio said the US built an outdoor warehouse type of operation for children that was enormous........in Serbia before the war even started ......... The way she wrote it........many children were taken and kept in this place and evidently sold. Because it was certainly not for long term........don't know what they did in bad weather.

            On Alex Djerassi's LinkedIn page, one of his interests is the Children's Investment Fund Foundation(CIFF).
           </p>
           <p>
            CIFF is one of just seven contributors to the Clinton Foundation that has donated more than $25,000,000 to them.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             CIFF focuses on transforming the lives of poor and vulnerable children living in developing countries. CIFF's investment priorities are childhood and adolescence, child protection, and climate change.[17] Within childhood and adolescence, areas of work include empowering girls and boys to control their sexual and reproductive health and to avoid unwanted pregnancies and HIV/AIDS; improving children and mothers’ health and nutrition; preventing low birthweight babies; eliminating deaths from severe acute malnutrition, nested within a more integrated approach to childhood development; and deworming efforts to break transmission for good.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Oh look it who it is
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In 2019, CIFF in partnership with Wellcome Trust also launched a joint Lancet-Financial Times Commission on Artificial Intelligence in global health expected to be published by end of 2021.

            So, if the Maxwell family is all Mossad that means Mossad was essentially running the Libya and Syria operations?
           </p>
           <p>
            Was the Maxwell family a slightly higher class outfit than the Pakistani Awan family of spies and used car dealers? Again, a protocol question: where do Used Car Dealers fit into the hierarchy of Madams, Pimps, Procurers, Blackmailers, Socialites, Lords, Ladies, Princes, Dukes, Duchesses and Oscar Winners?

             I read about some expats/ westerners/ reporters trying to escape Libya during the siege, and they described a building that the Talmudic Jews had taken over, and turned into a death camp of sorts. They said they took over an entire area in Tripoli. They were told to avoid that area to make it to the bay in time to meet the ferry. Story seems to be scrubbed. Gave exact locations, and I can't find it.

             It's another aspect of globalism, and has to do with plausible deniability. Or in other words, the work the CIA would like to do either overseas or at home is gleefully outsourced to other countries' intelligence agencies. They all cooperate at the top, CIA, Mossad, MI6, etc. What is too risky for one, usually due to the possibility of unwanted exposure, is offered to another.

             Lots of mysteries in systemic problems.........ie. continuing pedophilia in western governments and catholic church. At the same time as 3 strikes and you are out is still on the books. We can see some people go to prison for years for a little marijuana/some people go to prison for life for stealing a loaf of bread. ...........and chronic pedophile convictions get an 8 year sentence. ........with time off for good behavior. That is systemic.
