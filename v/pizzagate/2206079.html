            A few people offered to help me out with my medical expenses for postpartum thyroiditis which was aggravated by the stress of these ongoing death threats. I also need to hire an attorney for legal defense after someone threatened me via CPS saying I was putting my children at risk by exposing them to the dangers of Pizzagate retaliation. If anyone wants to help out, I put three ways to donate up here on my Twitter account,

            </a>
            After my family and I feel a little safer and I have some time to get a little relief from my current situation with all the threats and problems, I'm going to start a foundation for legal defense of other journalists so anything left over will be used towards that.

            There seems to be a large number of people on Voat who are not who they say they are, this is just an update to let everyone know I am still alive, my kids are safe, and whoever was sending me threats may have just been trying to scare me but at this point I do not know. Amy

            This person may be one of my stalkers. He posts a photo of a car sitting outside of a shop, which appears to be a shop near where I live. The person in the profile seems to be white, but the car in that photo looks like it might be the one used in my stalking on May 16 which was involving a hispanic man. This person has me and several other reporters and politicians on several different lists. But yet, I have no reason to be on any lists with any of those people besides my reporting on Pizzagate. I am guessing this is a personal stalker who uses those politicians like a beard. The last photo posted on the account from yesterday was a pedo picture of a man covered in pasta. Help me identify this person so I can go to the police.

            I found a steemit article from a year ago, there was another Greg Chism someone found arrest records for but that was Gregory Scott Chism and he only slightly resembled the Greg P. Chism we are looking at. Just wanted you guys to know that in case you happen upon that steemit article. Google seems to have hidden that from me but I remember someone here sending me the link to it before and I just didn't have time to look that closely before.

            If you do not want to get targeted like me I suggest you do something to protect your IP address before you search for any of these, especially #13 the weird baby games site that has a section about pizza under “descendants games.” I stumbled on at least one blog about Lisa Irwin that tracks every single person who comes to the website and you can even view who is on there at the time, and then remove your own IP address. That one is the Shadow Play blog about “simulated kidnappings.”
           </p>
           <p>
            1) I tried to tweet at the Tacopina Law firm last night and Twitter started blocking me from doing so. I assume people are screwing with / remotely messing with my computer. I tried contacting them today by phone, the secretary said that they are no longer representing the family. I emailed the info@ address with some information.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Yesterday, I was starting to look really far into the Lisa Irwin case after I finished writing up this post. In my mind it is necessary to flesh this out completely to see if anything does not fit what I have spotted. There is tons of stuff online. Immediately when I first began looking up clips I noticed that it seemed almost like Megyn Kelly was put on the case because there was something unique about it. From everything I am reading there seems to be a controlled narrative that Lisa Irwin's mom was in on the kidnapping which I do not believe. I have many reasons for this, but I cannot rule it out until I am done investigating.
           </p>
           <p>
            A year ago (coincidentally right when Pizzagate got big) the family was forced to take down their missing sign from their front yard by the city.
            <a href="http://fox4kc.com/2016/10/04/city-tells-baby-lisas-family-they-must-take-down-sign-posted-in-their-yard/">
             http://fox4kc.com/2016/10/04/city-tells-baby-lisas-family-they-must-take-down-sign-posted-in-their-yard/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The main and most important evidence to me so far is the fact that everything I have found so far confirms rather than negates my impression about Greg Chism having her.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) Regardless of how or where those kids in his household came from, I have found nothing that makes me think he is in any way innocent or that I was overreacting to his being a creepy pedophile.
           </p>
           <p>
            4) The people who work with Greg Chism are not really trying to hide their creepiness at all. Their code speak is obvious, just watch these videos:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa20P6dcXGg&amp;feature=youtu.be">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa20P6dcXGg&amp;feature=youtu.be
            </a>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve4_q68uytg&amp;feature=youtu.be">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve4_q68uytg&amp;feature=youtu.be
            </a>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKWMhS5zQLY&amp;feature=youtu.be">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKWMhS5zQLY&amp;feature=youtu.be
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            5) Why is a person who at least somewhat looks like John S. Tanko ("Jersey") dedicating a video of a heavy metal song performance cover on YouTube to Greg Chism? What is that about? I have screenshots of someone commenting that his basement is similar to Hannibal Lecter. Is that a joke or is it not a joke? Who knows.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgSrSSLpBy4&amp;t=311s">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgSrSSLpBy4&amp;t=311s
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            6) Why did Greg Chism make a video in 2013 showing off his stomach and delving into his heart problems when he was 19 / 20 ish. In the video, he lifts his shirt and shows that he has six scars on his stomach.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKWMhS5zQLY&amp;feature=youtu.be">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKWMhS5zQLY&amp;feature=youtu.be
            </a>
            Are these ONLY scars from a surgery or is he showing off? A person of interest or a witness was questioned in 2012 regarding the Lisa Irwin case, someone who was being questioned after he stabbed someone "in self defense" according to him. And the person he stabbed "had his intestines sliced."
           </p>
           <p>
            7) In a subsequent video, Interview with Geek to Freak, by Top Notch Lawn Care,
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa20P6dcXGg&amp;feature=youtu.be">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa20P6dcXGg&amp;feature=youtu.be
            </a>
            Greg goes on and on and on about his experience playing Hockey but he doesn't reflect on how he was able to play so much hockey (Skating - a code word on craigslist) with a severe heart defect / heart issue. I suppose we are to think that his heart problem was fine during that time, but he recently went back to the hospital for a heart problem again (right after I reported him in July). During this video and I recommend you all watch it from start to finish, he mentions several times how badly he drools thinking about his hockey gear, and uses many many many creepy phrases and expressions. He can hardly keep his laughter in. The other guy says that he would "love to see that footage" of Greg Chism's stash of hockey gear. He goes on and on about how much money he makes and his "operations" from doing lawn care. At the end of the video the other dude makes a point of addressing the video Greg made in 2013 about the heart problems (the one I mentioned above where he showed his stomach with the six possible stab wound marks). He says he doesn't want to live dangerously he just wants to make enough money to be happy and he thinks people should get into the lawn care business because these days you can become a millionaire doing lawn care.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the middle part of this video the guys make a joke about online dating on Craigslist. They then post an ad that Greg posted on Craigslist and it has the abbreviations in the capital letters that we have seen before. I can't figure out what any of them mean, but I'm sure they've got to be sexual or pedo. The ad says that the ability to do a drive a zero angle turn is a plus. This is a lawn care reference to a lawn mower but it is on Urban Dictionary as a sexual thing as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            He also mentions that he decided when he was 38 that this is what he wanted to do for a living. That's around the time that the other girl in the videos would have been a baby or right before. She's about 8 and he's around 46.
           </p>
           <p>
            8) Another video mentions that Greg had to take down his previous channel Greek to Freak lawn care, because of "haters" and that he needed to "protect his family."
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve4_q68uytg">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve4_q68uytg
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            9) I found an article that says that John Tanko bragged to a witness about kidnapping Lisa Irwin for $300.
            <a href="http://fox4kc.com/2011/11/18/irwin-attorney-jersey-bragged-about-kidnapping-lisa/">
             http://fox4kc.com/2011/11/18/irwin-attorney-jersey-bragged-about-kidnapping-lisa/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            10) In the 2013 heart problems explanation video, Greg Chism mentions that he went to St. Louis for the open heart surgery and has had two. I wonder if we can find out whether he was the stabbing victim that was held in the hospital after the other witness was questioned.
            <a href="http://www.kctv5.com/story/16969868/witness-in-lisa-irwin-case-faces-stabbing-charge">
             http://www.kctv5.com/story/16969868/witness-in-lisa-irwin-case-faces-stabbing-charge
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            11) There is yet another guy doing a lawn care video on YouTube and he is clearly speaking in code.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROEpetgqgrA&amp;t=171s">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROEpetgqgrA&amp;t=171s
            </a>
            “I made a Terrible mistake. lawn care.”
           </p>
           <p>
            At this point I think it's necessary to investigate the photos of everyone in his "lawn care" ring.
           </p>
           <p>

            3) Here are a few more Lisa Irwin facts

            Megan Wright &amp; John "Jersey" Tanko are not clean. Cops covering it up.
1) The originally accused but later "cleared" kidnapperJohn S. Tanko is a felon who has served time in prison for not one, not two, but at least three different charges including burglary &amp; tampering with a vehicle. I need to look and see when he was in and out of prison but obviously the police must know him well in Kansas City. He lives on the same street as the Irwin / Bradley family to this day, but 11 miles from them. And he has never moved throughout all of his prison convictions. He was in prison before the kidnapping and went back after.
2) The accused kidnapper's former girlfriend Megan Wright was also sentenced to years in prison (and has violated probation by smoking marijuana and failing to take her parenting class or some dumb crap) because she nearly starved her own child to death. She was ordered to write a letter to her child, never be caught alone with a child again, and to undergo mental health treatment.

            I also found a YT channel doing a farewell to Greg Chism video where they talk about how he had to take down his YT channel about lawn care bc of all the haters getting too close to his family and trying to hurt them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another one where he talks about his heart issues starting at 19.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another one where he claims he played on 5 hockey teams at one time in the winter as an adult, but never mentions any heart issues.
           </p>
           <p>
            A lot of creepy pervs make tribute videos to him. And also, one satanist who kind of looks like John Jersey Tanko but it's hard to tell for sure.
will edit with links.

            I'm giving this post a "Share!" flair because AmyJames appears to have stirred up a genuine hornets nest and needs to publicize the threats she is receiving. The more people know about this, the safer she and her family will be. Please retweet, share on fakebook, and crosspost on Voat as well as Reddit. Thanks!

            Sounds eerily similar to the MO Are_We_Sure used on Jem. Maybe he's the culprit in your threats too.

            Maybe he's deserving of an "expose" of his hidden truths if you know what I mean.

             <p>
              In the mean time, I can start downloading the relevant images that were used in the threats and post them here.

              Exhibit A. Makes a cryptic reference to a murder. More specifically one refered to in the "Wet Works" wikileaks email. As someone who's family background is miltary service, I can confirm that "wet works" is in fact code word for "extrajudicial killing" aka assassination. Also note the phrase referencing the wikileaks email about "making examples out of leakers even if they're innocent".

             </p>
             <p>
              Exhibit B: A reference to one of the Jeffery Daumer murders. Note that the body is in the Arch of Hysteria pose. The elites have stuff like this as art work as shown in findings very early on in the investigation. Those pieces are likely in the executive summary thread.
             </p>

             </p>
             <p>
              Exhibit C: The other part of the post in Exhibit B proving it was Are_We__Sure that posted the Daumer poc.
             </p>
             <p>
              There seems to be a common MO of making cryptic references to murders relevant to the users in question. Thus I suspect AreWeSure is the culprit in both sets of death threats.

               Thank you for the screenshots, darkknight. I spent most of this evening reviewing Are We Sure's Comment history to find the originals. There isn't enough here for me to be able to get Voat to take any action. It really isn't clear that he was threatening Jem (he claimed it was a comment on his arguement, not directed at him personally.) Also, there is no evidence he has any way to carry out anything in real life. Voat's free-speech commitment allows rude and offensive communication. This looks more like a misunderstanding than a credible threat, to me. Do link me to anything that may prove otherwise if it comes up.

            Just finished typing this and then I noticed, my friend Evelyn Pringle was supposed to have George Webb on her show today, but he did not call in.

            I have received direct death threats including showing me pictures of Marfa, Tx (Scalia Muder scene) when that did not intimidate me they showed a picture of Jeffrey Dahmers headless victim in the "arch of hysteria" position on top of a mattress. Then asked me if I felt sorry for the mattress.

            I was also jumped at my home 8 weeks ago and told to keep my fucking mouth shut. And have been told it appears this was a hit job.
