<p>Notice how that one wasn\'t even a photoshop?  He was called out that same day
 by a YouTuber who found his actual identity but didn\'t want to ruin the kids life so she mislead people into thinking he was a half-autistic Twitch gamer.

TheGrimReader is Sye Phan aka Phan Sye, Cyphon Cyphon6.. a guy who claims on the nets to be Lulzsec, CTRLsec, and ANTsec, but CTRLsec denies him.. ANTsec denies him.. and well.... he\'s a liar. #PhotoshopWarrior . edit* I said kid... he\'s in his late 30\'s.      Do Shills only want to waste time?...

            Hmm, some people had said that this Sye Phan guy was responsible for the "Newcummers menu"... do we know if that's the case? The verbiage did seem to match. If so... and this guy really is that guy and who you say he is, then he owes me 12 hours of my life trying to stop the hoaxes from spreading (and that's still reverberating out there). Time I could have spent digging.... and then there's damage to the integrity of the investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the attempted hack of the comet ping pong portal, I did find it hard to believe that they would have left anything there, other than for purposes of a honeypot. They have eyes all over these forums, and aren't completely stupid. Didn't take a look at his links, however, and took it for granted (and I even saw the original). Good eye.
           </p>
           <p>
            Well, public investigations do have their drawbacks... especially when going up against trained disinfo agents and a bunch of pranksters...

            Ok but which part of the Hawaii lead are we supposed to ignore? From what I've seen, you can search for it all and it's all legit. Maybe the connections he made were incorrect but the background info is all there to be seen.

             Side note: did anyone else catch that warning post to be careful because us talking about Hawaii is "pissing a lot of people off"? It was up for about 30 or so mins and then gone. Kinda makes me think we shouldn't ignore anything.

            Any poster who consistantly gets posts with more than 150 upvoats is probably a shill.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only way you get that many voats is by getting shills and non-shill voats.
           </p>
           <p>
            They take legitimate, original research from others, reframe it the way they want (leaving out context, sources, details they want to hide, steering people in a certain direction), they post with clickbait title, and get their shills to upvoat it. Non-shills upvoat as well as they see "oh goody a new lead"... not knowing they are being steered off course.
           </p>
           <p>
            ALL CAPS TITLES is a red flag too.

              Mods cant win deleting posts with hundreds of voats, they will make themselves look like shills. The shills want you to question the mods, and hopefully shut the whole sub down. Mods are in lose-lose position. Only way to counter is non-shill awareness of shill tactics.
