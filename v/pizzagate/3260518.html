<p>It seems to be made for kids, yet contains a LOT of reading as none of the characters have voices. Yet the script of the game seems also geared for kids.

<p>However, within the tutorial, you play a game of Hide and Seek using a phallic-like signal detector gun to find a couple of very young alien kids. Ok. Strange. A few minutes later, after completing the turtorial and getting launch codes for your ship to explore the galaxy, a statue with glowing eyes turns to you suddenly, putting your character in a trance, and flashes a bunch of quick memories of your playtime in a strobe like fashion. What the...?!</p>
<p>Seconds later, you last off the planet in your personal rocket ship to visit some nearby ruins on the planet\'s orbiting moon.

            <p>
             who made it?
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Alex Beachum, a college student who was working on it for his master's thesis at USC, was the brainfather of the concept. They then hired full-time developers to work on it for commercial release in 2015; then developer and actor Masi Oka, founder of Mobius Digital, took up the project to develop it further and release it through indie platform "Fig."
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Who funded it?
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Eventually, publisher Annapurna Interactive started funding it in 2018, and bought out the rights from Fig. And soon set themselves up to put it on Xbox Game Pass by 2019.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Is this a grooming product?
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Based on your descriptions, I could imagine that it could be used for such purposes; a groomer could use the game to converse with or hypnotise his victims in order to peel away the children's existential certainty of reality. And it could be the main reason why the bigger companies took it up in the first place; but so far, this is speculation. We would have to dig deeper into the personal connections and profiles of the personel involved with the project, especially Masi Oka and his developing company, and the extent at which government agents/funding are/is active in USC.

            Those overt signs are everywhere which is quite disturbing.  Westin hotel has it all over their Scottsdale lobby artwork and this artist promoted/sold in their gift shop:

            Google the fifty fifty restaurants in Chicago and you will see all kinds of Luciferian names and symbols.  In addition to Roots, they have Leviathon, Apogee.  I always wonder about that 2 block radius at around Grant/Dearborn Grant/State street.  There's one of those Ping Pong places right there too.
