<p>Backpage founders also own the <strong>Phoenix New Times</strong> .. <a href="http://www.gilbertwatch.com/index.cfm/blog/the-loathsome-phoenix-new-times-6-690-hate-filled-articles-against-russell-pearce/">The Loathsome Phoenix New Times - 6,690 Hate-Filled Articles Against Russell Pearce</a>.</p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, of course the Phoenix New Times has done a lengthy article on this case : <a href="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/the-battle-over-backpagecom-rages-threatening-free-speech-and-the-internet-as-we-know-it-8999043">The Battle Over Backpage.com Rages, Threatening Free Speech and the Internet as We Know It</a>.  
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The writer of the article Stephens Lemons seems to have quite a reputation. For example, in this letter on <strong><a href="http://911blogger.com/news/2007-03-02/sander-hicks-open-letter-phoenix-new-times-re-stephen-lemons">the 9/11 blog about the 9/11 Accountability Conference in Arizona</a></strong> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The New Times\' assignment of Stephen Lemons to the recent <strong>9/11 Accountability Conference</strong> in Chandler, Arizona was irresponsible. His reporting was rife with malice, a willful disregard for the truth, and character assassination against yours truly. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is troubling to see a publication like the Phoenix New Times\' attempt to twist the Backpage\'s lack of cooperation in their court case as a fight for \'freedom of speech\' argument. They seem to have some support : <a href="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/critics-take-to-social-media-to-decry-backpage-censorship-8984443">http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/critics-take-to-social-media-to-decry-backpage-censorship-8984443</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, I guess people use the services of the companies and individuals that advertize through backpage, either knowingly or unknowingly.  Take <strong>Ashton Kutcher</strong>, for example.  He was seen leaving a Hollywood massage parlour back in 2015 : <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3373381/Ashton-Kutcher-pictured-leaving-Hollywood-massage-parlour-solo-visit.html">PICTURED: Ashton Kutcher is seen leaving Hollywood massage parlour after solo visit</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The actor, 37, who is married to Mila Kunis, paid a solo visit to the <strong>Ancient Therapy Massage Parlour</strong> in North Hollywood last week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The interesting thing about the Ancient Therapy Massage Parlour, is that if you google it, <a href="https://locality.com/place/ancient-therapy-north-hollywood-ca">https://locality.com/place/ancient-therapy-north-hollywood-ca</a>, the directories will indicate a website and a phone number which is actually located in the UK.  This is the website you will get <a href="http://raylugg.wixsite.com/ancient-therapy1">http://raylugg.wixsite.com/ancient-therapy1</a>.</p>
<p>However, that\'s not in North Hollywood.  THIS is the correct website for the Ancient Therapy Massage Parlour in North Hollywood : &quot;losangeles.backpage.com/TherapeuticMassage/ancient-massage-free-table-shower-grand-opening-818-760-2288/50587668&quot; . <a href="http://imgur.com/a/2egII">http://imgur.com/a/2egII</a></p>
