Digging into the shady dealings of these people or pointing out when their sycophants in the press try to cover it up may sustain us but I don\'t know if it\'s enough to keep up the momentum. I\'d like to bank on the Streisand Effect increasing exponentially the harder they try to suppress us but I don\'t want to leave it up to chance.</p>
<p>I have two proposals to keep us on the offense and they rely on us using their own tactics against them.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal 1: The New Media.</strong></p>
<p>We all know the establishment has control of the press. This is self-evident to anyone that looks at any articles published by the whore press. They all use the same exact &quot;fake news&quot; trope as if directed. Because it is directed. These are all the same big names that literally allowed the Clinton campaign to write their articles, programming, et al. We need a counter to the \'legacy media\'. Social media, censorship aside, is the answer. I proposed in other topics, with no responses really, the creation of a directory for disseminating information we think is pertinent. The directory would be organized into three tiers.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 1: Celebrities</strong> who are \'woke\', \'based\' or frankly just hate the machine. This is not the category we should bank on making the most difference since most celebrities are shills for the establishment. But characters like <strong>Roseanne Barr</strong> are aggressively posting about this stuff. We also know at least two celebs that came out about child abuse being rampant in Hollywood, <strong>Corey Feldman</strong> and <strong>Elijah Wood</strong>. We should make contact with people on social media with big voices who will speak truth to power.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 1.5: Internet personalities</strong>, not quite celebrities but not just grassroots journalists. \'Internet famous\'. This is where I\'d put guys like <strong>Stefan Molyneux</strong> who has brought up Pizzagate. People with verified accounts on social media, huge followings (in his case 100k+), and are down to drop truth bombs. </p>
<p><strong>Tier 2: Grassroots journalists</strong> on social media. On the higher end we have <strong>Mike Cernovich</strong> and <strong>Paul Joseph Watson</strong>. Moving down we have <strong>David Seaman</strong>, <strong>Brittany Pettibone</strong> and a cadre of others with decent audiences. I have the ears of Brittany and David (through her) and both approve of this project and will take part. Brittany was also kind enough to provide a dozen names we should also work with. <a href="https://sli.mg/b1QZSH">https://sli.mg/b1QZSH</a>   She follows me on Twitter and Gab now. <a href="https://sli.mg/JEHNF7">https://sli.mg/JEHNF7</a>   We need to network.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 3: Concerned &amp; outraged citizens</strong>. Most people just don\'t think \'spirit cooking\', creepy child abuse \'artwork\' &amp; sexually charged Instagram posts of kids are acceptable under any circumstance. They especially don\'t if it\'s tied to real abuse of children. They especially-especially don\'t if it\'s sexual abuse. These are the folks that are our ultimate targets and the targets of the prior two tiers. I consider myself, with just over 1k followers, in this category. I myself am growing at a rate of about 100 followers a day. Which means we can have a <strong>big</strong> impact. I\'ve got calls out to my followers right now for those who\'d reliably take part in this. </p>
<p>But essentially <strong>Voat</strong> (and <strong>select delegates</strong> I imagine) would be acting as a <strong>brain trust</strong>, pretty much like it already is, and would fire off signals through its neurons or however the fuck this analogy should be described. Basically Voat does a more coherent job of directing information it finds to the folks in these tiers who will disseminate it to their audiences. We\'re talking about transitioning from an autistic investigation by a loose collection of citizens into a well-oiled perpetual motion device.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal 2: The New Shills.</strong></p>
<p>It is absolutely no secret that <strong>Correct The Record</strong> was and still is a thing. I can tell you all first hand from posting <strong>Voat</strong> findings on <strong>Twitter</strong> that a single person can easily get dozens of <strong>shills shitposting</strong> using the exact same <strong>scripts</strong>. It\'s rehearsed and we all know it. I can post pictures of posts using the same phrases. Questioning your sanity, telling you you\'re mentally ill/crazy, saying you need to be medicated (this is called \'gaslighting\', a distraction intended to make you doubt your own sanity). Retweeting your posts and tagging the FBI and saying you should be imprisoned \'or worse\', tagging Comet Ping Pong and hoping they sue you for slander, et cetera. (using the potential for harm coming to those speaking out). Blaming that bullshit gunman or violence that may possibly happen in the future on speaking out about pedophiles (concern trolling of the most transparent and shittiest quality). </p>
<p>These people are organized and it\'s not hard to see why. They literally have nothing but innuendo. They can\'t kill us all. Can\'t censor us all yet. And they absolutely can\'t argue the facts. I\'ve had about a hundred folks challenge me on social media using the same scripted lines and when pushed to debunk anything about Pizzagate they either disappear, block you, or continue calling it crazy. Or some combination. They\'re clearly panicking and that\'s good. But we need to capitalize on their panic. How? Trolling right back. They call us Russian trolls/hackers and/or white supremacist hate-mongers while they bombard the internet with fake outrage and ban dissent. Two can play at that game.</p>
<p>With the coming of the platforms Gab and Minds, social media is being divided between those against free speech and those against censorship. Gab and Minds are both as far as I know still in Beta testing. They obviously don\'t have the traffic Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc. have but they\'re new tools for us to exploit against the old guard. I\'ve created accounts on both and want to use them as part of a larger campaign for exposing Pizzagate.</p>
<p>Whatever anyone\'s opinions here are of Donald Trump and Milo Yiannopoulos there\'s no denying one thing: They rose to prominence by being outrageous shitlords. This is especially true for Trump who, if you\'ll excuse the cliche, played four-dimensional chess the entire campaign. We need to be able to not only out-think and out-perform shills but also out-shill them. Not by being partisan sycophants too or by transparently regurgitating the same cringy &amp; scripted lines over and over. But by using our wits to humiliate them. And nothing humiliates authoritarians and the establishment like humor. To his credit Milo made a decent point recently. The best way to fight these entrenched interests is with laughter because it\'s something they can\'t control.</p>
<p>Here\'s something I have been working on over the past day on Minds, a literal army of shitposting.   <a href="https://sli.mg/ziZXnE">https://sli.mg/ziZXnE</a>  It\'s not enough to just say these people are pedophiles. We need to make them into laughing stocks over it. And we need to push the limits of satire. We need to create viral messages. </p>
<p>Imagine thousands or millions of younger people for instance seeing a post by a Dragonball Z villain referencing Pizzagate and then looking it up because it caught their attention better than an evidently crazy hashtag campaign. <a href="https://sli.mg/mUQ4ZH">https://sli.mg/mUQ4ZH</a></p>
<p>How ridiculous is it to post about Pizzagate from the point of view of Chinese philosopher Confucius? Very ridiculous and it should totally be a thing. <a href="https://sli.mg/uVfIKi">https://sli.mg/uVfIKi</a></p>
<p>We cannot allow these people to hide behind the &quot;fake news&quot; mantra and garner sympathy over manufactured attacks/threats. We need change the narrative from &quot;These poor people are being slandered&quot; to &quot;Hey everyone look at this meme about those sick pedophiles&quot;. I hate to say it like this but, yes while we should keep it out of our research, confirmation bias is a very powerful weapon in a war of ideas like this.</p>
<p>And no I don\'t want to derail what you guys are already doing. You\'re doing great work. Keep investigating, keep digging. But we need a blitzkrieg, shock troops. We need to be in front of this. Organized. And very much proactive. What I\'m suggesting might seem silly or even counterproductive to some of you, but if the government, their whores in the press and their sycophants on social media are going to get blown the fuck out it needs to be done with both surgical precision AND with shock &amp; awe. This isn\'t <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">r/conspiracy</a> where we can just afford to sit on our asses calling eachother shills all day or /pol/ where everything\'s <em>kike this</em> and <em>kike that</em>. We need to treat this like a serious fight for civilization and just short of breaking the law use every weapon available to us. If they can\'t silence us they try to shame us. WE CAN AND MUST SHAME THEM.</p>
<p>I would appreciate help organizing these two proposals into serious initiatives. We already have the means to do this. They don\'t <em>get</em> the internet or how it works. We do. We just need the initiative. Weaponizing social media is just as important as weaponizing autism. We need a sword just as much as a shield.</p>',

           <em>
            get

           the internet or how it works. We do. We just need the initiative. Weaponizing social media is just as important as weaponizing autism. We need a sword just as much as a shield.

              Dang..I'm seeing a lot of folks waking up a bit just glancing through the hashtag. Maybe there's hope. It's as we thought would be the response. It's unbelievable because this stuff is just unspeakable things! I'm playing the "not quite awake but was curious because the pope even came out, now this quicklike C eye A report all of a sudden. I feel like maybe we ought pretend we're drowsy before the powers do something dire so they take down the world when they go down. I'm moderately curious everywhere but here on voat. Oh and the odd comment sect here and there. I'm specifically looking for those that were curious and now realize it has legs, collecting those for a meme. It's a good idea for those that have open minded folks on your list. Those kinda comments by real people will have them think, yeah, I don't wanna believe it but...and end up inspecting it. Facebook allows for pictures, and hopefully it'll make rounds before it's deleted from my acct

            Look, those two apps are fine ideas.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, create a Gmail, FB, Twitter, IG, Tumblr, reddit acct
           </p>
           <p>
            Then
           </p>
           <p>
            Go to IFTTT and string them together.
           </p>
           <p>
            One post on FB posts to everything else. Get the Drumup extension, to one click everything you are reading about pizzagate into a posting schedule.
           </p>
           <p>
            As you browse, you feed real news into social media and increase awareness with very little effort.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, every post can be entered into a Google sheet, so you have a database to share.
