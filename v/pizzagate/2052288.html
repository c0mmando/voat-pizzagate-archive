<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/125814985/109518200-Regina-s-Story">This</a> is her full story.  I had to stop reading because it was stomach-churning.  THis is an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hunts were generally organised during the official hunting season ....  The children
had to run into the woods and the hunters tried to catch them. At the boundary of the area
in which the children had to stay, guards with dogs were posted so no one could run
away. If a child got caught it had to take off a piece of clothing and was hunted again.
When it was totally naked the hunter who had paid for it could do whatever he wanted
with it, depending on the amount of money paid. Usually two sometimes three children
were killed during a standard hunt. It was indeed quite expensive to kill a child and
sometimes several hunters put money together. And the bodies had to be taken care of 
too, but they had a very well organised logistic system to make them disappear. I still
remember the names of several children who died during those hunts: Sarah, Maude,
Tom, Katrien and others. There were several Eastern European girls among the victims.
They had been smuggled into Belgium one way or another and nobody would miss them.
I have also seen several children of the North African type being killed. And at the end of 
the hunt there was a big party during which the remaining children got raped and abused.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a ritual:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tony led me to the table, on top of which I had to lie down, my legs spread apart, my
arms stretched out above my head. Joe took the rabbit out of its cage, a sweet white little
thing with red eyes; it kicked its rear legs in panic. The man who was holding the knife
took it over from Joe, held it above me, right above my belly, and cut it open with one
single slash. The bunny’s squeal went right to the bone. I closed my eyes and felt the warm blood
dripping on my body. It nauseated me, and I only started breathing again when the
squealing had stopped. The bunny was dead, finally. All was deadly quiet in the garage.
The other kids stared at the dead animal above me. Their eyes filled with terror. The first
sound I heard was the desperate sob of the little girl. The threat had become real to
Chrissie. If she ever betrayed the group, her family would be in danger. She was ordered
to drink from the chalice with the rabbit-blood, to fulfil her lifelong duty to protect the
group.</p>
<p>The other children were raped and abused until the abusers were satisfied. During the abuse they showed child
 porn movies. With a dangerous grin on his face Joe chose a tape on which a very young
girl, about two years old got raped and murdered. He forced me to watch while he used a
vibrator on me. When I was finally brought outside it seemed as if the major part of 
myself, of my soul had been murdered.</p>

<p>satanic abuse ...appears to operate in terms ... of pyramidal control, much like any corporate system of hierarchical productivity. On the lower tiers are the ritualistic pop-culture manifestations for the masses. These occultists are used to act as a supply of pasties to take the heat from the core networks operating at a much higher deeper levels of the military-Industrial complex; a core stratum of institutionalised abuse which is protected by every possible avenue of leakage. As such, Satanism is a highly useful method of obfuscation and distortion. When proven cases of satanic abuse have occurred, they have often been independent groupings separated from any organized and systematic rings. There are also those branches which have sprouted from the more formalised crime ring or network of porn, prostitution, and sexual slavery, which in turn have connections to the high-level elitist and generational groupings of satanic worship under a variety of tastes and flavours. However, our perceptions of Satanism as fed to us by the popular press has largely acted as a smokescreen, creating deflections from the true sources of a very real brand of Existential Satanic ritual that is far more sophisticated and without the parlour games and pantomime costumes so enamoured of the lower tiers.</p>

            The Dutroux case is a nightmare. The Podesta- Solvay connections is still of interest, and of course Chateau des Amerois (Mother Of Darkness Castle) that I've called the epicenter of the Global pedophile ring. Many roads lead to this Castle.

             Cathy O'Obrien is a not an "agent" - she was heavily involved with MK Ultra and Project Monarch and broke free (was deprogrammed) with the help of Mark Philips. People who have been attacked from time to time may get manipulated in various ways, unwittingly acting as tools/agents of what they are ostensibly against - that doesn't make them "agents" in my book. I utilize overall intent, a lot of fruit going one way (her books, seminars) - could it be a prelude to an attack, simply building up trust? There are those vectors, everyone needs to decide for themselves how heavy to weight strongly held variables such as these. Like I said, in my opinion, she is not an "agent".

               Did you read her book? That's exactly what she says it is. All the lizard mumbo jumbo is fake &amp; used to confuse the victims and discredit them if they try to tell the truth.

                Cathy O'brien and Mark Phillips are both shills. I stand by this . Have you foĺlowed their more recent antics in Germany, with the pretty girl they added to the cause? Its all fake.

            I believe the Dutroux case maybe the greatest conspiracy in modern times, it baffles me that our dumbed down society never talks about it.

            Thanks for the links. I found the police transcripts of several victims related to the Dutroux case but they are in french. I couldn't read it entirely because it's the stuff of nightmares really...
           </p>
           <p>
            It confirms everything we know about pizzagate and SRA. Also, around 15 of the witnesses, that were to testify against the belgium royalty and politicians among others, were killed or suicided... some of them the very day of their planned testimony.
