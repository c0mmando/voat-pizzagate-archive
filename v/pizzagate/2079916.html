            Good find.  More blatant grooming.
           </p>
           <p>
            The KidsFirst! film camp stirs up dread.  Star-struck kids and their equally star-struck parents willingly being sucked forever into the black hell-hole of Hollywood.  When will parents wake up?
           </p>
           <p>
            BTW, one of the sponsors of KidsFirst! (along with Disney) is KidzWorld.com
            <a href="http://www.kidsfirst.org/about-us/who-are-members.html">

            , run by James Achilles (discussed by pizzgaters but never proven to be linked to Alefantis).  It’s billed as a safe and closely monitored place for kids to interact online, but here are some reviews by parents and kid users--In general, kids think its pretty good and parents think it's bad, including this one:  "PARENTS BEWARE!  Within 3 hours of being on that website for the first time, my daughter was contacted by at least 3 adults who asked for photos of her legs in stockings, a miniskirt, etc. The website is a haven for predators and should be shut down."

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, KidzWorld.com proclaims that they “support” KidSafeSeal.com, a web and app safety certification service.  However, it turns out that KidzWorld.com is actually not listed by that organization as a certified safe site.
