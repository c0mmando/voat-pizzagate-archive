<p>But as I make myself watch it again, there is <strong>ALOT</strong> of blatant scenes with bondage, gagging, and just about everything else, so it\'s leading me to believe this is an (if there ever were such a thing) adult substitute for child sex/molestation.</p>
<p>I know it\'s sick, but so are the people we\'re dealing with.

They made a obvious reference to &quot;keys&quot; but I can\'t find anything pedo related on that. With the guy who created it saying it\'s &quot;art&quot; and put that with the contents of the video aligned with what we\'ve discovered these terms and objects mean/represent, it just seemed too coincidental to me, IMHO.</p>

            The only "keys" I can think of is Alistair Crowley's 3 keys of the law. His all seeing eye represents a rectum. I could only watch a momment of the video so I never saw the reference to the keys.

            There might be something with the "keys". The other day I was reading a post here on Voat about the McCann case. I remember telling to myself that her eye defect really looked like a key hole. Then right after I saw an advertizing with the words "KEY HOLE" really in evidence. I didn't think much of it but I thought it was a funny coincidence. Then I read an article on "Coloboma" (the eye defect that Madeleine McCann has) and in this article it clearly said that one of the distinct signs of coloboma is the keyhole shape of the eye.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, I don't know what to make of this, but I keep thinking about it since that time.
