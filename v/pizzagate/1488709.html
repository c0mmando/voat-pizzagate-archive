            WOW MAN! You've got real talent! I don't understand why people downvote this? Maybe they don't like what they see? I wonder why..? Be aware that shills and moles are here on Voat.co as well, I've encountered several.
           </p>
           <p>
            Guess your art became a bit too REAL for some people?
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, I think you're really doing something great here, just imagine if you could host an art exhibition called #PizzaGate, and show these pictures there, and people would start asking "what does this all mean?" And then you'd be able to show them all the sick stuff that actually came out of the Podesta e-mails and Alifantis Instagram etc. It would set of an avalanche of people starting to look into this FOR REAL!
           </p>
           <p>
            GREAT WORK MAN! Keep up the good work! And might I ask you, that InfoWars brain drug, I guess that was BrainForce, yes? Is it really THAT good? :-D (Been thinking of ordering some myself)

            So people are going to mock that guy's art, despite it being his effort to get people to "look into this a bit more" if they are pizzagate skeptics, or "be skeptical of their conclusions" if they believe pizzagate is real.
           </p>

            But those same sort of people will defend shit like this
