<p>&quot;This LGBT Activist\'s House Was Burned Down. Police Now Suspect He Set the Fire Himself.&quot;
&quot;In 2017, prominent Michigan LGBT activist Nikki Joly, a transgender man, was the victim of an apparent hate crime: An unknown arsonist burned down his house, which had two dogs and three cats trapped inside&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Police have long suspected that Joly set the fire himself, though it took a while to collect sufficient evidence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Joly didn\'t own the house, and thus did not collect any insurance money from it. He did receive more than $58,000 in donations, however.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just because Joly has been charged does not mean he is guilty, of course. He is entitled to due process and a presumption of innocence. Many in his community refuse to believe he could have played a role in the fire, given that it killed his five pets. Other former supporters of Joly\'s now believe they were duped, however.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The existence of two high-profile hate crime hoaxes—neither of them yet proven in a court of law—should not be used to discredit every alleged hate crime. But this news does provide a timely reminder that many stories are more complicated than they first seem. Self-described victims should be greeted with support and sympathy, not automatic belief that they must be telling the truth. Sometimes, they\'re not.&quot;
