            I've always thought that it was weird that a lot of old money families and celebrities have have odd/early deaths among them. Maybe some are accidents, maybe there is more to it. I don't know if they are pizzagate or mindcontrol, being compelled to shut up or just victims of their own success. A few more names:  Bob Marley &amp; weaponized cancer, Anderson Cooper's brother's suicide, Eric Clapton's son (maybe just an accident here), Heath Ledger, Prince??, people around Bob Geldorf/Michael Hutchens, Jim Morrison (father was involved in Viet Nam Tonkin incident),  Joe Strummer, Whitney Houston...
