            All I know about Seagl is he openly suggested on RT, that in regards to all our gun violence, that much of it was staged aka shooint hoaxes. I was shcoked I heard that on TV, already knowing that is true. He also moved to Russia and is a fan of Putin and thinks the USA is lost itself. If it comes from Steele's mouth, it should be doubted, but even liars need to give some truth to gain cred. I really do not have an opinion except that Steele is a low down forked tongue spook.

            I think we will start to see a lot more of the Pedos throwing the blame out on to innocents (like Seagal) who are exposing them, its a muddy the waters tactic.
Narcissism 101 - they always blame others for what they are doing themselves.

            Seagal just finished filming an anti trafficking documentary in Thailand according to Robert David Steeles latest interview. He's also a comissioner for the International Tribunal for Natural Justice who are holding a Comission of inquiry into Human Trafficking and Child Sex Abuse.....??? Dr Cynthia Mcinnney is also involved in this. Is this pure deflection aka rules for radicals Alinksy style or is someone trying to discredit Seagal (ex Navey Seal). Is he one of the dying breed of Alpha males left on planet earth or just a depraved creep?

             Seagal is a scary fucker. Maybe it's all show, but I doubt it. He knows all the players in hollywood. He is not an actor, he can only play one role. I would not be surprised one bit to find out he is one of the CIA agents in Hollywood acting under operation mockbird or some other propaganda campaign. Even if he is not an agent he is neck deep in PG and the sex abuse scandals gutting Hollywood right now. Ray Dawn Chong already threw him under the bus.

              He  is  obviously a punk and selfish, uncouth, sexual  harasses  women-but  other than  that so  far  I  have seen  no  evidence that he  is  involved  as  you say  he  is, in  the  deeper accusations, and a man  in  his shoes with  his mouth is  bound to  make  a  lot  of  enemies, the sexual  trafficking  case  is  of  interest,  but the  case  was  dropped, the evidence  is sketchy;  I see  no  CIA  connection,  although I am sure he  has  rubbed elbows  with  many, after  all he  is a  high  level  teacher; I will  not  be surprised  to  find  many  of the worst allegations  true,  but it is  not  right to vilify  a  man  unless  you  are  sure  of  his "doings," he  has  a  lot  of good  work  to  his  credit, he  has  achieved  great  things-this  doesn't  excuse  behavior but it  is a  positive  indicator of  a  person's character (though  not proof),  but  if  you  make claims please support them  with  evidence

            In November 2008, A&amp;E announced that they had begun taping Steven Seagal: Lawman, which follows his work in the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office. The series premiered on A&amp;E on December 2, 2009. Seagal stated that "I’ve decided to work with A&amp;E on this series now because I believe it’s important to show the nation all the positive work being accomplished here in Louisiana—to see the passion and commitment that comes from the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office in this post-Katrina environment." The series premiere drew 3.6 million viewers, ranking as best season opener for any original A&amp;E series ever.[33]
On April 14, 2010, the series was suspended by Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand due to a sexual trafficking lawsuit filed against Seagal. The suit was later dropped.[34] A&amp;E resumed the show for the second season which began on October 6, 2010.
In February 2011, A&amp;E announced that the series would begin production on Season 3 episodes, with a change of location from Louisiana to Maricopa County, Arizona

            Other than his American citizenship, Seagal was granted Serbian citizenship on 11 January 2016, following several visits to the country, and has been asked to train Aikido to the Serbian Special Forces.[47]
Seagal was granted Russian citizenship on 3 November 2016, according to government spokesman Dmitry Peskov, "He was asking quite insistently and over a lengthy period to be granted citizenship".[

             Gut says not to worry, haven't bothered to look into him too deeply though - despite MANY abstract references to him popping up in my work and in conversation, etc... opening intro on wiki indicates good things to me.

               Ditto, if it turns out he's a worldfucker, well, shit... no skin off my back, I'm not sentimentally attached to him or his work.

               In the end, Weinstein even had his grubby little mitts in the work of some of the people I'm supporting and pawing through for clues, but, I have every reason to believe they have been actively undermining him, by leaving said clues.

                 Short answer, Harvey likes to think he has power(and will go to great efforts to conceal his crimes and preside over them post-fact), this much is becoming quite evident in at least a few ways - I'm unsure as to his brother's level of involvement, but, my gut certainly doesn't trust him any more than Harvey at the moment.

                 Yes and no... they had more power before the Weinstein scandal and before pizzagate and etc... the pedos with power are not necessarily just people within Hollywood, again, this much is already well known.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The pedo magicians who wield power... they're a bother, but, from what I can tell, most have been taken out(arrested, etc), severely crippling their network.

            This is getting bad.  Maybe it is the time that we decide as a nation and a people that we boycott Hollywood and the entertainment industries until they get control of this.  Maybe Congress, instead of wasting billions investigating Donald Trump, should investigate this and the other crimes against children and millions of people who were brought into this country for slaves.  I thought we fought a Civil War over this a hundred years ago.  I was molested when I was ten years old, and it took me a long time to get over it, and I know I am still suffering from it.  This pisses me off that this is still allowed to go on. I do not care if you are rich, poor or even a movie star.  Rape is Rape.  You should be in Prison.

             We've been had, literally. Actors playing the part, wearing masks and hiding behind money they made from us being entertaind. Sowing and reaping chaos. Sorry bout your troubles guyslade. God speed to total healing. You are not alone.
