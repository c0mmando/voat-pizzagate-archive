<p>Hello dear community,</p>
<p>I do not know where to start so I\'m just going straight up with it.</p>
<p>First of all I am not a person you can easily convince with conspiracy theories and normally i wouldn\'t even think about this entire shit.
A friend of mine brought this whole #pizzagate stuff to me and i said: okay lets take a little self investigation into this. I wish i hadn\'t.
I am so disgusted about all of these evidences which can not be a Radom, non-connected thing. It is just way too much. 
All of these pedophile pictures and paintings everywhere. 
How can anyone find these kind of art even good or why in the hell would you buy some of this.
For real guys, you can not tell me that anyone who has children or anyone who is empathic would buy a single one of these.
This entire #pizzagate stuff is just way too much to be told here. I am investigating by myself the whole time and what made me the most suspicious is the fact that even reddit put the /pizzagate down. 
The entire Instagram-Accounts, Podesta Brothers, the mother..... killroom?! 
Why, why do we had to reveal this entire shit.
I just want to say Thank You! to everyone who is investigating into this and a big thanks to everyone who is submitting here and brings up really trustworthy sources  and stuff. You\'re doing a great work for the entire world. </p>
<p>I do not have anything to say. I am disgusted like i never was and I am so disappointed in every celeb who did not even say a word about this theme. This is so connected and I believe that a lot people are scared as shit because this whole thing is about to blow up.</p>
<p>Greetz</p>',

            Of course we are all in this together but to be honest: What can we do.
I am so grateful to everyone who is giving up his/her free time to do some investigation into this creepy stuff but do we change anything. Even if it is reveled, even if it is all true, what can we do? Nothing. It is complete powerlessness.
I can not tell you how much hate, disgust and pain i feel for everyone who is involved into this.
Thanks to you guys, for real tho!

             Even if the right people dont get jail time... we need to wake enough people so their main weapon... the MSM is uselesss. That will bring them down to their knees. If they cant control the population, they have no power. When they have no power, thats when we go for their head. Chop it off
