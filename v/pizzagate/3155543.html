            "Evan Chandler was an American screenwriter and dentist. In 1993, he accused pop singer Michael Jackson of child sexual abuse against his son Jordan. The civil case was settled out of court. No criminal charges were filed. In June 2009, Jackson died of a propofol overdose. Five months later, Chandler committed suicide."
           </p>
           <p>
            So is Evan Chandler which isn't even his real name (Child Handler), real name Evan Robert Charmatz (fake jew luciferian last name) related to Ray Chandler aka Rachel Chandler, also Child Handler??

             Once a child is traumatized by the Devil’s Simulation, they still have choices. They can
resist or succumb. If they succumb, they often grow into adulthood to become fellow partakers
of the abuse they once suffered. Once they prove their loyalty to the monsters who stole their
innocence, they may be rewarded lavishly.
Such was pop music sensation Michael Jackson. Bizarre behavior such as surgical addictions
and severe identity crises of both race and gender are clear signs of early abuse.
Jackson’s secluded multi-million dollar estate (perfect for abusing children without
interference) was named the “Neverland Ranch”; taken from J.M. Barrie’s legendary children’s
fable Peter Pan.
Many children were allowed to be placed in Jackson’s care. Eventually, one child’s parent
came forward with accusations of abuse.
Wikipedia states definitively it was a “false accusation”.
In the summer of 1993, Evan Chandler falsely accused Michael Jackson of sexually
molesting his 13-year-old son, Jordan.
[273]
It was a “false accusation” that won Evan Chandler and his son a massive settlement from the
pop star. It’s an interesting outcome given that, apparently, nothing came of the criminal
investigation.
Yet, after this victory against the Pedocracy, Mr. Chandler got “depressed”.
In January 1994 Jackson reached a financial settlement for $32,000,000 with the
Chandlers to resolve the matter and in September a criminal investigation was closed. On
November 5, 2009, Chandler committed suicide in his apartment in Jersey City, New
Jersey.
[274]
It was just a few months after Jackson, himself, had “died in his sleep” at only 51 years of
age.
On June 25, 2009, Jackson stopped breathing while attempting to sleep under the care of
Conrad Murray, his personal physician. Murray had reportedly given Jackson an array of
medications in an attempt to help him sleep at his rented mansion in Holmby Hills, Los
Angeles. Attempts at resuscitating Jackson were unsuccessful.
[292][293] ~ Wikipedia
[275]
At least he was in the care of a trusted physician who was pumping him full of narcotics to
“help” him.
Seven years after the deaths of both Jackson and his first accuser, upon “investigating”
another accusation police and media finally decided, “Well maybe there was something there
after all...”

              However, Walter Elias Disney (1901 – 1966) was an abused child reputed to be a
homosexual pedophile.
[277] He was also a member of the de Molay Society for Boys. Named
after the “final” Grand Master of the Templars, Jacques de Molay. Other prominent members
include Jesuit-trained “Baptist” William Jefferson Clinton and Irish Catholic film star Marion
Michael Morrison (also a Freemason
[278]). Morrison is better known by his screen name, “John
Wayne”.
Disney productions are renown for hiding sexually-explicit images or subliminal messages
but only the Roman Catholic “American Life League” was allowed to bring the matter to public
attention with a Disney boycott and newspaper-published Opinion Editorial by President and CoFounder Judith Brown

               Peter Pan is a fictional character created by Scottish novelist and playwright J. M.
Barrie. A free spirited and mischievous young boy who can fly and never grows up, Peter
Pan spends his never-ending childhood having adventures on the mythical island of
Neverland as the leader of the Lost Boys, interacting with fairies, pirates, mermaids,
Native Americans, and occasionally ordinary children from the world outside Neverland.
~ Wikipedia
Our first red flag is that “Pan” is the mischievous Greek god of sex, often depicted as a satyr
with an erect phallus. It was a god happily adopted by the Romans with no changes.
The second is the endless depictions in plays and film and the third is the number of
androgynous young women cast as “Peter Pan” in most of them.
If you add adaptations, the list grows logarithmically.
For instance, the 1987 movie Lost Boys is about teenage boy vampires who “never grow up”.
It starred Corey Haim, Kiefer Sutherland and Corey Feldman. Haim would later die before his
40
th birthday. His close friend and fellow child actor Corey Feldman stated that the official cause
of “pneumonia” was a cover-up, that Haim’s conspicuous problems with drugs and alcohol were
caused by trauma he received as a victim of Hollywood pedophiles.
Corey Feldman has shared shocking details about the rampant sexual abuse he and other
young actors were forced to endure during their years in Hollywood.
In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Feldman discusses how he was repeatedly
molested by adult males in the industry, saying these men would pass many young stars
“back and forth to each other.”
He also reveals that his closest friend, Corey Haim, was raped when he was just 11 by a
producer, the start of a long cycle of sexual abuse that Feldman believes led to his friend’s
problems with drugs and alcohol later in life.
Haim would struggle with drugs up until his death in 2010 at the age of 38, a death that
Feldman blames on the men who abused the actor.
Feldman’s comments come just days after another former child star, Elijah Wood, also
gave an interview talking about the pedophilia problem in Hollywood. ~ Daily Mail
[283]
In an interview with ABC: Nightline,
[284] Feldman would state:
“The number 1 problem in Hollywood was, and is, and always will be pedophilia...that’s
the biggest problem for children in this industry.” ...
“It’s all done under the radar.” ...
Host: “Nobody talks about it?”
Feldman: “It’s the big secret.”
Host: “It’s that widespread?”
Feldman: “Oh yeah. I was surrounded by them when I was 14 years old.” ...
“They all had their own power or connections to great power in this industry.” ...
“They’ve gotten away with it for so long that they feel they’re above the law, and it has to
stop.”
Their manager was Chris Snyder who also managed River Phoenix. Phoenix died at 23 of a
“drug overdose” on Halloween in 1993. More on that in Chapter 25.
Worst of all are the concerns surrounding Peter Pan’s creator, Baronet Sir James Matthew
Barrie.
The impetus for his “Lost Boys” were the children of Arthur and Sylvia Llewelyn-Davies, a
middle class family with many bills to pay. Barrie began paying them and, in turn, spent an
inordinate amount of time with the boys.
Barrie’s idol was novelist George du Maurier who wrote the novel Trilby. In it a musician
named Svengali hypnotizes a tone-deaf girl into singing greatness. Maurier was speaking from
experience as he used the technique to seduce a 17 year old “nude model” of his.
[italics suspended]
To Barrie, Trilby represented the very sort of mind-games and manipulation that appealed
to his nature. He must also have suspected that du Maurier had written from experience.
He wanted to connect with him, for the mesmeric magic to rub off on him too.

            Wendy and.......'Bangarang Peter Pan': Obama Pays Tribute To Robin Williams, Famous 'Hook' Quote After Actor's Death
           </p>
           <p>
            ""Bangarang!" It was the Lost Boys' battle cry in "Hook" and now it's how fans worldwide will remember comedian Robin Williams. President Barack Obama paid tribute to the actor after his death Monday with a statement referencing one of Williams' most famous scenes. "Robin Williams was an airman, a doctor, a genie, a nanny, a president, a professor, a bangarang Peter Pan, and everything in between," Obama's statement read.....OK, but what does it mean? Apparently, it's a Jamaican word that means disturbance."
