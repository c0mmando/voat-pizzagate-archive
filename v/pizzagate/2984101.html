            How young is 'young blood'? Who are these young people giving their blood?  Where are they sourcing these young people? Children cannot consent to this and parents would not be able to offer up their children's blood, which would make blood taking illegal.

             In certain states, parents can allow their 16/17 year olds to give blood. Tons of high schools do blood donation drives (usually paired with grisly drinking and driving vids/performances of car crash victims)

            In all likelihood we will eventually develop much more direct and effective life extension technology that doesn't require fucked up shit, but the old psychotic kike crowd needs blood now so they can hang on to finish business before entrusting it to their retarded fag descendants like David Rothschild who on their own would fuck it all up after 2000 years.

            This topic gets a lot of hype, here and in the MSM. I've looked into it, and as it turns out, a lot of the parabiosis experiments that led to young blood transfusion experiments showed that quite a large portion of both populations (donor and recipient) became ill and died. There seems to be something about levels of HGH (human growth hormone) that are beneficial to the young to help them grow, but harmful to older creatures causing higher incidents of cancer and death, for example. Here is an interesting article I found on the subject:
            <a href="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/parabiosis-the-next-snakeoil/">
             https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/parabiosis-the-next-snakeoil/
            </a>
            . So, unless a lot of secret clinical trials have been conducted on large numbers of people that we don't know about, the uber rich are playing roulette if they are getting these transfusions.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's not to say that they are not preparing for a future where they can harvest blood from the young by normalizing the idea in the press (even creating demand for those large scale clinical trials), getting everyone used to genotyping their DNA via Ancestry.com and 23andMe so they know whose blood to go after, pushing veganism and organic farming to create a cleaner blood supply, and that kind of thing.

              Not specifically, but I do know that HGH is a cancer culprit, so if embryonic stem cells produce high levels of it, the risk would be there, too.
