<p>Directed by Scottish filmmaker Kevin Macdonald, Whitney - which debuted at the Cannes Film Festival - claims that the singing icon was abused by her cousin Dee Dee Warwick.</p>
<p>The allegations are made in the documentary by Houston\'s half-brother, former NBA basketball player Gary Garland-Houston, as well as her assistant Mary Jones.</p>
<p>According to The Guardian, Garland-Houston alleges - alongside her former manager Pat Houston - that he was abused by Warwick between the ages of seven and nine when Whitney would have been just three or four-years-old. Jones reportedly claims that Houston used to speak of being &quot;molested at a young age&quot; by a woman.</p>
<p>Dee Dee Warwick, who enjoyed success as a gospel performer in the early 70s, was the niece of Houston\'s mother. Her older sister was soul-singing legend Dionne Warwick.</p>
<p>Whitney, described as&quot;the definitive story&quot; of the legendary singer, is said to feature interviews with a variety of Houston\'s relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Macdonald, speaking about the claims, told Deadline: &quot;I first began to suspect that there might be some kind of abuse involved before anyone had actually told me. I just had a sense, having sat watching interviews about her, watching footage of her. I had a feeling that there was something wrong with her.</p>
<p>&quot;That was just an intuition, and then somebody mentioned it off-camera to me. They wouldn’t talk about it on camera, but they said Whitney had said to her that something had happened.&quot;</p>
<p>Houston - one of the most successful recording artists of all time - passed away in 2012 at the age of 48 after drowning in a bathtub. Three years later, her daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, was found unresponsive in a bathtub and died aged 22 after spending six months in a coma</p>
<p>Whitney will be released in UK cinemas on 6 July&quot;</p>
