<p>From Baby Burlesk to Disney producers perving on kids in changing rooms, Hollywood has been a shithole.</p>
<p>Copypasta; the actual thread has links to documentaries and images.</p>

<p>More
One of the most blatant sexualization of kids is the early Shirley Temple-era &quot;Baby Burlesk&quot; films. Lolita\'s writer cited them as his inspiration for the novel.</p>
<p>Here\'s a short documentary. It\'s nauseating, but helps one understand our current trajectory.</p>
<p>IMHO, those films never should have been made. There\'s no excuse for making a three year old play the role of a prostitute. But it was done for shits and giggles by the men responsible for it\'s creation.</p>
<p>But that\'s the culture in Hollywood. Those in power want their giggles.</p>
<p>We see it with the outting of professional predators in Hollywood, like Weinstein and Spacey. They wanted their shits and giggles. No one tells them no-- and if they do, too fucking bad.</p>
<p>CDaN\'s recent blind items &quot;The Interview&quot; pts 1 &amp; 2, demonstrate this further.</p>
<p>Grown ass men watching kids changing.
Grown ass men asking those kids names.
Grown ass men wanting to talk to those kids in private, to &quot;coach them&quot;
Grown ass men blowing off kid actors with involved parents.
Grown ass men asking kids &quot;what would you do to be in this show/movie?&quot;</p>
<p>That CDaN blind, by the way, deals with a former Disney actress.</p>
<p>Now, ask yourself why do studios like Nickelodeon and Disney hire CONVICTED PEDOPHILES to work on their shows which, surprise surprise, involves children? </p>
<p>Here\'s another good documentary.</p>
<p>Now, onto James Gunn and Disney.</p>
<p>Disney had access to his twitter account when they hired him. Would he be held to a morality clause in his contract? Oh, how I wonder.</p>
<p>They had access. They ignored or enabled and ultimately didn\'t do due diligence.</p>
<p>And if I\'m wrong about this, let me know, but Disney didn\'t do jack shit when people were hijacking their characters and making disgusting videos targeted toward children. You know, about keeping secrets and playing with scat.
Yeah.
But Disney will go after bakers and daycares.</p>
<p>Seriously. Put an image of Mickey on the wall at a day care, go to court.
Use a character on a cake, go to court.</p>
<p>Create vids targeting lil kids about playing with poop and sticking different colored M&amp;Ms up one\'s rear? On YouTube? Fine. </p>
<p>That\'s #ElsaGate for the uninitiated.</p>
<p>Now look at the reactions from Hollywood peeps standing up for really, really unacceptable comments.</p>
<p>Want to alienate a demographic from ever watching your movies? Mock their abuse. Publicly. Be that kind of douchebag.</p>
<p>Now look at last tweet there.
The one where he\'s talking about Disney characters.
One would think the image-conscious Disney company would have asked him to please remove that tweet. You know, since it involves their intellectual property and he was an employee.</p>
<p>Did none of his coworkers follow him? How did TEN THOUSAND disgusting tweets escape notice?</p>
<p>Like I said, it\'s a culture.</p>
<p>And if there\'s a civil war, it\'ll be based on this culture.
You can ignore and enable, or you can let \'em know they are fucked in the head.</p>
<p>Your choice.</p>

            Any famous person, politician, celeb or what-have-you... even just the average person-  better get ready to denounce pedophilia and take a stand in defense of children.

            I had a family male family member who used to tell me he like nubies meaning young nubile women.  I thought that sick and didn't like hearing him say it.  But I didn't know how sick.  Later he sexually abused his step daughter using the excuse to be a kindly elder male teaching her about sex.  His wife said OK but later when they divorced she took him to court, had her daughter testify and he spent time in jail.  Both of them were sick.  He said he learned his lesson, but later I heard him criticizing the step daughter for everything about how she led her life.  So he substituted controlling for sex.  Family members helped cover up the jail stay so HE could not be shamed among friends and other family.  I learned about it when visiting him because he wanted to make sure I didn't blow the cover, not because he wanted to be up front.  I write this personal note because even a comment that a male is attracted to nubile young women should be a warning.  Thousands of comments like Gunn did is clearly indicative that he is a danger to young children.

            I had one twitter user ask me if I worked for Disney because I tweeted negatively about Gunn.  So the assumption is that if you dislike Gunn you must like Disney.  Nope.  Disney is disgusting.  When I was a kid they made movies with drunks in it for humor.  Well families with drunks don't find drunkeness very funny.  All their little "princess" movies make young girls think the be all and end all in life is to be beautiful and marry a prince.  But since Pizzagate I have seen that their is a much blacker side to their movies and so of course they knew about Gunn and hired him anyway or because.  And only an outcry that might harm their bottom line gets them to fire him.  Its all sick sick sick
