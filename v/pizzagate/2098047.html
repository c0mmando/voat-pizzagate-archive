<p>&quot;Easy to judge fellas. Did u watch many of his videos about young girls posing like models intended for foreign clients? Yes it was but not to sell them for sex like a piece of meat. I know some girls on his other videos like Hazel, Czarina &amp; Bianca all of them are from Pampanga. They met their foreign sponsors old enough to be their father but nothing illegal happened. Actually the foreign guys ended up as the loser because they spent insane amount of money for the girls without something in return.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think some of you don\'t quite get it. Most of these girls come from poor families. Their best chance at a decent life is to marry a western man. White men are Rock Stars in the Philippines. It\'s because all of their TV actors and actresses are light skinned. These girls don\'t worry so much about the age of a man. They are more concerned that he be faithful to her, and provide for her and her children. It is absolutely normal for an 18 yr old girl to marry a 50 yr old man from the states or other western countries,....or even a wealthy pinoy. Stop judging. This is the culture they live in. I\'m 49 yrs old, in great shape, financially secure, etc; and married to a beautiful 30 yr old Pinay. She had an 8 yr old daughter when we met, which made it virtually impossible to find a husband in her country. She loves me, her family loves me, and most importantly, I love them. My family has welcomed her with open arms also. Please stop judging these people, based on our customs and beliefs. Who\'s to say we\'re correct. Hell, my grandmother was 14 when she married. That was normal back then.﻿&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To all those who wants to report and claim this is a scam or a phedophile issue, I see this whole thing as - If there is a demand - There is a supply. SIMPLE AS THAT. To the foreign eyes the girls may look like under age, but do not forget the Filipina girls tend to look much younger than their age. A 26 year old can easily look 18. A 23 year old can easily look 16. As long as the girls are of legal age and as you lets face it - men loves it younger. NOT A DAMM THING ANYBODY CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.﻿&quot;</p>

            The man in Bebots needs to be hung and castrated....selling the access to little girls that are simply hungry for a great meal or longing for new clothes is totally despicable. These poor, poor little girls...

            Sickening shit from YouTube. There's pedo-centric shit all over there. Yet they censored Joy Villa and Kaya Jones for being too American basically. They've since backed off those 2 beautiful, intelligent American Patriots from what I heard.

            Google knows the world is addicted and can't stop going back to them for the good stuff. So unless you gain some self control and can quit cold turkey (using their services) you just sound like cry baby customers.

            This is because the platform is owned and run by degenerate Jews and their crypto brethren.  The ony way to stop it is to start taking scalps, quite literally!  The Philippines has so many perverse and deviant inhabitants e.g. a large transexual &amp; paedophile community and  and such dire poverty that it's unlikely to get any better.  They are also embroiled in a battle with insurgency but Duterte would rather play war hero than save a future generation.

            Asians can look much younger than they actually are its important to make that distinction. Sometimes these guys are sticking it the face just to get a reaction. Back home they'd have no chance of getting laid.

            Why don't we get someone to add all the advertisers paying for this monetized shite to this post. I'm going to flair it "Share!" to get more eyeballs in here. If people post who the advertizers are, we can email them and let them know what they are supporting.

             Start compiling screenshots of the advertisements as they are displayed/rotated out at start of these videos or look at the code base and see which ad tags are present//where the ad calls are going [Using an HTTP sniffs such as Charles or Wireshark]. The lagged is the easiest way to make sure you capture all parties involved in these monetary transactions through YT.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is a major theme in digital advertising especially, "brand safety" or w/e term you'd like to give it. There are many parties not doing their job, YT isn't the only one at fault.
            </p>
            <p>
             In other news - fuck this guy. I can't go into this one cause i don't have it in me to watch any of these videos.
            </p>
            <p>
             Well compiled tho OP, you clearly have a well documented collection of child exploitation (regardless of any other strongly-rooted allegations).
            </p>
            <p>
             Have you flagged these videos or taken any further follow-up action w YT?
