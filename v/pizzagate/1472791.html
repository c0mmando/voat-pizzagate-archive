            I am not an an attorney but I have been involved in multiple cases and I speak from experience. Public outcry is what these prosecutors need in order to proceed.  Logic does not create an emotional response, this case has facts and images that are shocking and do not need to be downplayed. This is how cases are brought to trial. As long as the public is demanding justice these children have a chance. These perpetrators are deflecting denying and hiding in the shadows. They want to be in the shadows time to shine a light on all they do.  Without public support the whistleblowers can do nothing, without public awareness the investigators are in an uphill battle alone endangering their careers, their lives and even their families. The children deserve their justice and their day in court. Sorry for the rant. I promise I speak from only good intentions and experience....public outcry is what the FBI and trey gowdy and trump need in order to act againt this very powerful group that has infiltrated every level of government, business, and even churches on a global scale. this is a movement that is huge already otherwise the pope would not have come out against it. They are scrambling....let them we have them on the defense.  I think this has hit critical mass, but it's not enough keep raising awareness the pedos have relied on smoke and mirrors, we have truth and justice on our side. The facts and images are very strong people  raise a public outcry so loud it won't be ignored, these victims need to be heard.

            Who said to wait? Obviously the media isn't going to help until Trump drains the swamp, but what is it we're supposed to be waiting for? I missed the memo.

            There are two known shills in here, the OP and LegionBill. I noticed two downvotes when i exposed the fraud in the post. Post had two objectives: 1. Incite violence while making us seem unhinged, to support the needed narrative for their planned false flag 2. To get upvoted to push legimate leads from the top. This post provides ZERO contribution...unless you are CTR.

             This is a violent-espousing shill that just joined to do exactly what this CTR-generated thread is trying to do: incite violence. We are onto you, shill. For the rest of us, i can pretty much guarantee a false flag is imminent. They were hoping to use this thread in the narrative.

            Remember, this is most likely tied into drugs also?  Look at the heroin epidemic in our country.  Where is that heroin coming from?  Guess what happens when the parents are found with heroin in their system....the state gets the babies through CPS.

            Guys, whats your plan after exposing pizzagate if/when you find a smoking gun?  Are you going to march on the whitehouse? Are you going to expose 90-100% of our elected government? Are you going to expose the CIA? NSA? FBI? State Department and their involvement in it?  How is justice going to be served, whats the plan? Who is going to run the government after its been completely torn down and ripped apart?  Are there going to be elections or are there going to be massive civil war?
           </p>
           <p>
            The reason why nothing is being done right now is because no one has a plan to factor in all these contingencies and more, its sad to say but its the truth only because there are so many people that aren't "awake"

            Consistent and continual pressure, stressing objectivity, focusing on law and order. Inform without malice or jumping to conclusions, get people questioning and when confronted, demand the right to question, not necessarily the answers.

            Any politician who touches pizzagate will wind up suicided because exposing it would lead to societal collapse.
A people's revolution is the only solution and I'm not confident that the people are willing enough.

            Make it go  global!
            <br/>
            There are even alt-news trying to move along  to the next big trauma, while forgetting that the 2 things   the elite like are   power and  some like  controlling children or controlling adult slave workers.     Those who like to dominate adults  in the slave work system  are as bad as those who like to dominate little children in their psycho shit.
           </p>
           <p>
            they want either war to dominate externally  or they want inflation and trauma to dominate internally --- then they want to legalize pedophilia.   Just check the legalization push in the Netherlands, and reledgisting age and details    all over the western world.   They want to be free to do it and they want people to accept it or tolerate it.

            I am sorry people like you that run into rooms pulling fire alarms are just annoying, it may be due to your youth and impetuous nature . I highly doubt anyone is just sitting on their hands and holding their breath. Just because people are not renting their lapels and tearing their hair out does not mean that things are going on behind the scenes.
In situation like this it is best to learn how to respond to situations instead of reacting. I am not going to run down to comet pizza and give away what I know. infact sometimes it helps to hold your cards. I believe that it will help for Trump to be in office. and for you to speak on Trump like you know him shows how silly and immature you are.
Investigations take time, diligence and patience .
 A solid case needs to be made not bombastic statemenst. Getting people all riled up is counterproductive.
Stay positive, stay dilgent, stay openminded and focused.
Sorry my friend but this has to be about FACTS and not FEELINGS.

            This. If Pizzagate is investigated right now, it would go the way of every other pedophile and money laundering investigation. He has to clean out the alphabet agencies first, or at the very least, get Sessions in there as DOJ.

            WTF concern trolling is this? NO one said "wait for Trump" to investigate. Only Milo was asked to "wait" and probably because if he speaks too soon, it will compromise things.  Same thing with Flynn. He was only publicly "fired" and that's a good 3D move. Makes them feel comfortable and safe.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's true there will literally be ZERO prosecution until Trump, but where the fuck you getting the idea we have to wait for him to be into office to investigate?
           </p>
           <p>
            Surely you're aware that Gowdy et al, just got a new whistleblower protection act for those who expose child trafficking etc?

              Why is this UPvoted? It's a stupid ass post. Yeah, something is coming, soon...they will not go quietly into that dark night....and it's gonna be ugly. Obama told the troops in a speech that they should overthrow Trump...and I'm like? WTF? That's treason..that and 98% of the military voted for Trump. It's insanity.

               FYI, the quick upvoting is a big clue often that CTR is at work. When you see it, be skeptical and dig into the history of the poster to see if he appears to be legitimate (consistent, clearly supporting our efforts) or a shill (cautioning in one post and showing huge conjecture in another, dismissing things that look legit, making exaggerated claims that are not supported, inciting violence or showing overt bigotry).This guy was an obvious shill. When they are caught, they sometimes try to delete their posts to reduce our exposure to their shill history.

            This guy is a huge shill trying to emotionally incite violence. Please find my detailed comment in this thread. They are planning a larger scale false flag to shut us down and need to point out how hysterical and unhinged we are. The story has been written, but they need a thread as a launching pad: "Pizzagate drove the arson of the entire block...we need to censor fake news and penalize any site that hosts it." I am very confident in my assessment. The OP is not one of us but CTR.

            I agree, however, we don't need to be "waiting" for anything, anything we dig up as
            <strong>
             citizen investigators
            </strong>
            is admissible in court, and cases are frequently built on circumstantial evidence, so public awareness/interest in this is good from now til inauguration and beyond, imo.

             I know I am new but may I chime in that the more shocking images the better. Like the spirit cooking. The public is influenced by images that trigger a strong emotional response. Attorneys use this techniques when they want to raise a public outcry to raise support for their case. We need to give trey and trump all the public demand for justice that we can.

            Yep.  "Wait for Trump" just means that we must wait for law enforcement to do anything.  If they do once Trump takes office.  It's not like we can make arrests, and we are doing as much research as we can.  We are already doing as much as we can legally do.  We have no choice but to "wait" for further investigation by LEO because the current administration is NOT going to investigate.  That's what people mean by "wait for Trump".

             If we don't see high profile arrests by February 20th, just assume that Trump is part of the plan and therefore justice under the law no longer applies.  These criminals running the CF and the CGI backed by actual worshipers of satan and the new world order own the governments of this world and there is nothing the people can do about it except go rogue.

              I'm afraid of this happening.  It's like Trump is our last hope (and not much of one maybe...)
Yep, I concur.  If he does nothing than it's clear that the final nail is in the coffin.
              <br/>
              Nobody is going to "go rogue" though.  It's just going to get swept under the rug by controlled media and forgotten about by everyone except the few in the conspiracy circles, who will be ridiculed as usual.  Then eventually someone will find a smoking gun, but guess what?  Nothing will happen again.  If this all comes to fruition, then the only way "out" isn't going rogue. We are going to need a leader who will do something to come into power.  If it isn't Trump, then we have to push for the person who it will be.  Either that or Jesus is going to return to earth and just have to fuck everybody's shit up (if you believe in that - if you don't then you probably have to just be resigned to the fact we are fucked forever because the criminals will NEVER release their grip on humankind willingly).

            This is a shill post. Look at his language and emotional tone, a rant to inspire violence, with massive and unnatural upvoting for zero contribution. It is fitting into a larger pattern. Guy joined moments before writing this post. He is very hostile and clearly anti-semitic. He wants the picture of those involved in Pizzagate to be frothy-mouthed biggots and haters. Like most people, i am outraged and want this to get to resolution, but this guy does not represent me. The new strategy of those who want to marginize us is to make us out as violent lunatics. I predict a larger false-flag operation within the next week or two. I hope I am wrong, but this guy's post is a good inspirational one for the narrative that points the finger at us when they light the whole block on fire, leading for demands to create internet ID laws and censor this "fake news" contagion. They WANT a violent event to give them cover for first-ammendment restrictions to really protect them from this or future citizen investigations of corruption.

             ....there was a very similar pattern in the Facebook pizzagate pages today. Two or three infiltrate at once, ask some weird questions, encourage riots or harassing businesses, then when people come back with no violence and patience responses they get strangely angry and leave. Almost sadly obvious!

            People aren't going to wait for Trump. 
People speculate that Trump is telling others to wait until he's sworn in.
All any of this is, anyway - is speculation.
Investigate whatever you want. Meme whatever you want, post whatever you want.
IF anything is to become of any of this, it won't be until after Jan 20th.
You sure as hell can't expect Obama's DOJ to do anything.

            No never wait, this is our time to build public outrage otherwise you are absolutely right we will lose momentum. Keep in mind we need a foundation and right now we are in early stages. These people are well funded and armed they have personnel and they control the milatary  and governments and banks the list goes on and on..We can't go into battle unarmed and unprepared and emotional. We have to be smarter and more logical, and more predatory.  We must continue to shine a light on their lies and secret dealings. Keep spreading the word now is our time to recruit. To quote Andrew breitbart we are playing to win! It's awesome you want justice, I love your energy! and let's wake people up. we will avenge those children....we will avenge all the fallen and assasinated, Truth and justice are on our side. We were born for just this time and place!

             Another shill...just joined and is so engaged in the fight to grow a militia to fight. Read my other posts in this thread. The goal of these shills is to incite violence or plant the theme in a thread as evidence to convict pizzagate as the culprit when the government torches the block of restaurants.

               I do apologize. I was trying to squash any discussion that headed toward violence as this was the precise goal in this thread. They are trying to manufacture the idea that we are hateful and violent bigots, and they will soon launch something bad (a fire, shooting with deaths...), likely staged but possibly with real casualties as these people have no soul, and blame  us. I was reacting to this comment: "We can't go into battle unarmed..." You look like a sincere guy once I had a chance to review, and I made an error in calling you out. There were two proven shills in the discussion: oursclitorisBill (the poster) and LegionWill (the supporter)

              A house divided against itself will never prevail. I am not a shill. This is a throwaway account. Raising a public outcry is all we can do. What do you suggest we do? Please let me know I only want to see these children get their day in court. What is your goal if I may ask?

               If I misclassified you, I am very sorry. They (CTR) started a coordinated campaign yesterday to incite violence, through the VOAT platform, FB, etc. It is a very subtle thing, but they want to post about the outrage and the need to take up arms to bring these people justice...so they can point to this planted thread as proof that we were behind the coming false flag op, which will be major. It was a clear goal to get people to move now and take action...don't wait for or trust Trump but be vigilantes. I am sorry if I misunderstood you on this, but the OP was doing this exact thing.

                No need to apologize, we are on the same team and we need to be careful of CTR. I thought you were CTR too. They are evil and complicit.

             I've convinced friends and family that it warrants a full investigation. The main stream media is forced to "debunk" it and they are failing miserably. Keep spreading and keep sharing. Not just on the internet but to people you know... we don't have to yell about it with raised eyebrows... just calmly telling people why questions still need to be answered is getting more and more persuasive.

            It is speculated that the conservative media is waiting until more pieces are put in place (Gowdy and the act to help child victims, Chaffetz with the bill to protect FBI whistleblowers), but that doesn't mean individual, private investigators/researchers/journalists have to wait.

            If Trump is not a good guy, there is nothing to wait for.  If Trump is a good guy, he will need an army of outraged citizens backing him up.  Seriously, who many deep satanist pedophiles are there in the USA?  We can start with the entire CFR membership, about 3000 people.  Add in their military/government/corporate staffs and extended family.  Add in their private bodyguards and mercenaries.  Add in the bribed/brainwashed US military and security personnel they control.  At a minimum there are tens of thousands of very organized, rich, and well armed people who would fight to the death to protect their system.
           </p>
           <p>
            If these people are evil enough to kidnap, traffic, rape, torture, sacrifice, organ harvest, and eat children, they will stop at nothing.  Their souls are already forfeit, they have nothing to loose except their freedom, money, and power.  We need MILLIONS of people to have any effect.  What we want to do, overthrow the satanists who have been in power in the US since shortly after Andrew Jackson, is an awesome task.   But we have a secret weapon, the backing of the divinity who has been waiting for the awakening of the divine within all of us.

             It traces back to Albert Pike that I know of....and I'd assume others at the top in that organization....other organizations too.  People can look back to the "illuminati scourge" of the late 1700's and see something similar in Bavaria.....where backdoor devil worship, sacrifice, plotting and planning to take over governments was uncovered.  The country ordered all groups to be found and exterminated. George Washington in one letter to the leader of Bavaria stated he did not think they had been eradicated, but was worried they had taken root in the American masonic lodges....then you have Pike, a grandmaster professing such worship.  They practice deception, the greater the deception, the more powerful the "magician".

             Astronaut Scott Kelly just spent a whole year in outer space...set a new record...while his identical twin stayed here on earth of course.  His wife and congresswoman Gabby Giffords was in a news story on TV where she was shot and suffered a brain injury.   The two can be seen going from town to town, doing live shows promoting gun control based on Gabby's injury.  They use the same script at different locations, where Gabby says she started "yogurt classes" (to indicate the brain injury from the TV show shooting) and hubby corrects her on cue everytime with "yoga honey".  Makes you wonder how she can remember her entire script but always mess up the word yogurt....unless it was part of that script.   Anyone who watched close might have noticed at first, she had one eye half shut everywhere she went to indicated injury, now she limps and eye is fine.

             Take it a step further, and try to explain how in one episode of life aboard the space station, an astronaut dry brushing his teeth explains how dangerous even one drop of loose water would be to electronics aboard the space craft.  Then in another episode we see a woman with her hair ridiculously permed to look like its floating, doing backflips while laughing and spilling water everywhere in a room full of electronics aboard the space station.  Not sure if anyone can figure that out.

            I have faith that the incoming admin is fully briefed on this issue and is fully implementing an action plan. This is not the "B" team taking the helm.  These are seasoned players.  They know what they are doing.  Key actors had full access for many years.  Don't think that knowledge has not been leveraged.

            I have to agree, we have to keep this moving no matter the cost! We can't let this get buried and bunched up with all the other conspiracies that were swept under the rug. We clearly have something here, it would be a shame to lose everything now. We shouldn't let all of our progress be for nothing. If this gets thrown into the dark in any way then these fools will be victorious. We can't let them win, we must not allow it in any way.

            Never come back? What, like they're going to stop trafficking children? If that's true, well...guess we stopped it, then. I'd be proud of that.
           </p>
           <p>
            But they won't stop. So, there will still be evidence. There will still be criminal activity. There will still be people involved. Goddamn, do you even know how long some investigations take professional outfits like the FBI? Months, if not years! If you're just going to be impatient because you want your reward like this is a fucking video game, then get out now - your haste is unhelpful and nothing but a weight on the minds of people who should be devoting research to investigation, not more of this demagogic shit.

            Why has Hillary Clinton came out of the DARK NOW? Why today? Here's WHY ...
           </p>
           <p>
            Five day's ago we proved that PIZZA-Blocks was owned by the ARAB (SAUDI/DUBAI), CLINTON has $1.5 BILLION US DOLLARS in her DUBAI account.
           </p>
           <p>
            The day after the revelation was the shooting comet-pizza ,ARAB lawyer just happened to be in comet-pizza, next day arab-lawyer appears on alex-jones to defend all arab's in Pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            The shit has hit the fan folks. For 40+ years the wash-dc has kept the PETRO-DOLLAR alive where the SAUDI's accept the USD (FIAT TOILET PAPER ) for their oil, this has kept the USA running, post 1972 NIXON the USA was bankrupt. Sauid's only asked for one thing, Infinite little white boys and girls to RAPE, KILL, and BLEED forever. The GOV agreed. Now because of the Weiner-&gt;Podesta scandals all has broke open.
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton caused this mess now she has a choice, she terminates PIZZAGATE or she loses her $1.5 BILLION USD in Dubai account.

            Once it goes public that SAUDI got millions of children in exchange for their accepting paper for OIL, then the entire world turns on Saudi, USA, ISRAEL, and UK.

             But who are the Saudis?  There are many sources that their origins are not Islamic at all:
            </p>
            <p>
             " D. Mustafa Turan wrote, in The Donmeh Jews, that Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab was a descendant of a family of Donmeh Jews from Turkey.  The Donmeh were descendants of followers of the infamous false-messiah of Judaism, Shabbetai Zevi, who shocked the Jewish world in 1666 by converting to Islam.  Viewing it as a sacred mystery, Zevi's followers imitated his conversion to Islam, though secretly keeping to their Kabbalistic doctrines.  In Europe, the Shabbeteans were eventually led a century later by Jacob Frank, claiming to be a reincarnation of Zevi.  And, according to Rabbi Antelman in To Eliminate the Opiate, to them belonged the Rothschilds who had a hand in the founding of the Bavarian Illuminati.  The Donmeh community of Turkey were concentrated in the city of Salonika, which became a hotbed of Masonic activity, and from which the Young Turk movement evolved, which aided in the collapse of the Muslim empire of the Ottoman Turks.  There is evidence that Ataturk himself, the founder of the modern Turkish state, was of Donmeh origin as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             Turan maintains that Abdul Wahhab's grandfather, Sulayman was actually Shulman, having belonged to the Jewish community of Bursa in Turkey.  From there he settled in Damascus, where he feigned Islam, but was apparently expelled for practicing sorcery.  He then fled to Egypt and he again faced condemnation, so made his way he to the Hijaz, where he got married and fathered Abdul Wahhab. According to the report, the same is claimed in The Donmeh Jews and the Origin of the Saudi Wahabis, Rifat Salim Kabar."

              Even before the Donmeh, there were Jewish origins of the Saudi tribe (whom the British decided to turn into "royals"). If you read their own court historian, he says that they are Jews.

                Thank you for your comment. 
That is my first post on voat or any other such site.
I realize now that I should have titled it differently, and I do understand that the source would be attacked. But just as the National Enquirer or The Daily Mail have occasionally come up with nuggets worth pursuing, and knowing that the MSM will never put this out, I took what is still up. I had seen this story before (in overseas sources) and I also saw that the factory investigation was shut down. The good sources have been wiped out, as of #pizzagate.
I have been researching this topic many years before it was called #pizzagate.
I see the trolls are in a hurry to downvote without doing any research or presenting any good ideas of their own.
So I appreciate that you took the time to comment, and I am open to any constructive suggestions, such as how to edit my post.

              That said, the children are sent to Saudi to be fucked and murdered, then the corpses are harvested in Israel, Tel-Aviv is the largest wholesaler on earth for organs.
             </p>
             <p>
              We cannot focus on Israel at this time, they own the USA and the internet, and the MSM.
             </p>
             <p>
              Once the MSM UK/USA collapses, then and only then can anyone be safely  discuss Israel.

              Remember Israel Owns Trump. Israel put Trump in power. Israel (HASBARA) feeds 4chan, and reddit; Israel owns facebook and twitter. Dual Citizens have USA by the balls.

               Pretty much.  Read the Talmud and everything in law, politics ,and economics becomes clear.  The satanism comes from the Kabbalah.  The state of Israel is no more than a nuclear armed hideout for international criminals.

                The Talmud doesn't explain why the west misrepresents the common law as being nothing more than case law (juducial precedent). This misrepresentation is rooted in atheism, and the Talmud is not a source of atheistic thought. Satanism and Kabbalah are both misunderstood by the West, Satan and the devil are not always the same, and Kabbalah is an esoteric shibboleth, essentially incomplete. The state of Israel shares the in the ideology of western statism, thus the false security of model of Gladio and Gladio B serves both western the military-industrial complex as well as the terrirtorial ambitions of Herzl's Greater Israel. When Netanyahu spoke of the shared values, interests, and destiny of the United States and Israel he wes speaking of the state, not of the people.

                At times, it seems that everything would be so much faster if we didn't have to deal with all the other researchers on the (((learning curve))) of real history. Not that I'm dogging the others -- Praise be to all researchers -- simply that it takes a long time to get to this info while they constantly throw (metaphor) things our general direction meanwhile they're heading towards the truth in our direction!

            Going to take months if digging until something is solid anyway, and how are you going to tell thousands of people to stop? Some dumb shill must of come up with this idea, seems to think there must be this giant electric switch somewhere with "pizzagate" written on it.

            I agree that we definitely shouldn't wait, hell fuck no!  I will give Trump a chance because of the effect he &amp; wikileaks together just had overturning both parties sending the establishment publicly into a full on panic.  Wikileaks called for dirt on Trump and nobody sent it to them.
But none of that means I'm a trumpBot incapable of realizing he has flaws and could even be a Trojan horse.
I believe it's all about fighting the NWO with all canons at once everything we got, this election set the fight is officially on.  #InItToWinIt!

            This depravity has a logic. Ever since The Godfather, all audiences know if you witness someone's criminality, you have leverage over them which ensures their loyalty.
This is the triangle through which the central eye sees all - Power:Loyalty:Depravity - and the perverse truth is no-one is more loyal to you than a murderous paedophile. By the simple virtue that this crime places people utterly beyond the redemption of decent society, those culpable of it are unquestioningly loyal to their masters and each other. This is also where the Satanism comes into it - not as a literal spiritual truth maybe, but as a tool to accentuate the depravity, which feeds the descending triangle of power/loyalty/depravity to the very nadir of possible human behaviour

             There is a literal spiritual truth to their satanism.  Even if Lucifer is make believe, satanism literally means opposition - to humanity, to the divine principle.  They hate humanity, hate everyone who is not them.  They hate the concept of anything being greater than themselves.  They hate freedom and truth.  They hate love, they destroy innocence.  This is evil incarnate

            If you bring partisanship into your expectations be prepared to be disappointed.  Trump is an outsider, but no so much he can be trusted without caution.  Republicans have been found guilty of the same crimes.  If Trump doesn't plan on acting on this, the court of public opinion might be used to sway him, but the investigation must continue and grow for that to even be a possibility.

             Almost all INTL child fucking revolves around EPSTEIN. For 25+ years EPSTEIN&amp;TRUMP owned "TEENAGE MODELING, INC" in NYC which was a front to enter 12 year old girls into prostitution.

            <p>
             Anybody that say's that TRUMP is not part of PIZZAGATE is part of the problem.

              Get a grip. Anyone with clear proof can just walk into the nearest police station and show the proof.  A few people here are extreme, demanding instant gratification, like leaders of a lynch mob.  Law is law.  It has to be done right at the appropriate moment, or it's just lowgrade babbling.
             </p>
             <p>
              You don't have to "wait" to investigate and try to prove things.  Instead a few people are utterly unrealistic and acting out hysterically and instead of investigating they are just writing headlines with incomplete fine print.

              I'm with you bud, trust absolutely no one; except most of you guys.  But when I think of what Milo said regarding the issue, we may not be aware of all of our allies.  But the Epstein connection with Trump should be enough for everyone to be highly critical of his involvement.

               Let's make him renounce his association with Epstein. He has been known to throw previous connections under the bus. He is a populist after all. If we make enough of a big stink he may take down that network out of sheer embarrassment and insecurity.

                We can't make him do anything, this cat has been smarter than anyone anticipated.  We can try like hell but the whole point is not to wait and see.  With any luck we'll see where he actually stands in time, but do not count on anything.

            Agree, there is a lot of HOPE in thinking that Trump will do something good. Hope is good, but it's also a good way to be disappointed.

             maybe the best we can hope for is that he causes a civil war within the 'network' that will blunt its power for a few decades. But the  TrumpEpstein connection does have me worried. Is there any evidence folks can point me towards of their business or personal ties?

              Trump renamed it to T-Models in 1999, that's where he meet his current wife.

              Google "Trump &amp; Epstein tag team anal rape 12 year old girl", TRUMP/EPSTEIN rarely vaginally fucked the girls, an intact hymen meant higher resale value to the Arab's.

              This shit is from the 1980's boyz, where have U been? 1980-2004 TRUMP/EPSTEIN were two conjoined siamese twins who shared their dick in the anus of little girls. In 2004 EPSTEIN got too hot for TRUMP, so they created the famous "Mar de largo" divorce where EPSTEIN was caught trying to fuck a 14 year old masseuse who went to parents, who went to cops.
